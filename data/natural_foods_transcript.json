{"xYemnKEKx0c": "So this story begins: I was at a friend\u2019s house She had on the library shelf a copy of the DSM manual Which is the diagnostic and statistical guide for mental illness. And it contains every mental illness that exists. In the past, in the 1950s, it was a small, thin booklet. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, Now it is a 886-page directory. It currently contains 374 mental illnesses. While I was reading it, I was wondering if you had any mental illness, It turns out that I have twelve of them. (Laughter) I have generalized anxiety disorder, This is necessarily known. I have nightmares disorder, Which is put under classification If you have frequent dreams that you will be pursued or declared to be a failure-- And all my dreams include people chasing me on the street Shouting \"You are a failure\" (Laughter) I have problems with the relationship between parents and the son, Which I blame my father for. (Laughter) I'm joking. I'm not kidding. I'm joking. And I have the disease. And I think it is a rare fact Have disease disease and generalized anxiety disorder, Because disease disease makes me feel very anxious. Whatever it was, I was looking through this book, Wondering if I was more crazy than I expected. Or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose that you have any mental illness If you are not a trainer to work professionally in this field, Or maybe the psychiatrist profession has a strange desire To label what is considered normal human behavior as a psychological disorder. I didn't know which of these two things is correct, But I thought it was a rather interesting idea. And I thought maybe I was supposed to meet a psychiatric critic To get his point. So I ended up at the lunch table with one of the Scientologists. He is a man named Brian He runs a special operations team of Scientologists Determined to fight psychiatry, wherever it is. They call the CCHR So I told him, \"Can you prove it to me Psychiatry is a false science that cannot be trusted? \" He said: \"Yes, we can prove it to you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said: \"We will introduce you to Tony.\" I said, \"Who is Tony?\" He said: \"Tony is on Broadmoor.\" Now, what he means by Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It was known as the \"Broadmoor Sanctuary for Unreasonable Criminals\". There they send serial killers And people who are unable to help themselves. Then I said to Brian, \"What did Tony do?\" He said, \"Hardly anything. Hitting someone or something like that, Then he decided to claim madness to get out of prison. But he claimed madness very well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor No one can believe that he is sane. Would you like us to try and get you to Broadmoor to meet Tony? \" And then I said, \"Yes, please.\" So I took the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn irresistibly at Kempton Park, Apparently, this is what dogs do when they're anxious-- Irresistibly yawning. And we got to Broadmoor. I was taken through a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate To the recovery center Where you can meet patients. It looks like a giant hampton The whole place has peach and pine trees and its colors are comfortable. The only glaring colors are the red color of the emergency button. Patients began to move in. They were a little full and wore cotton sports shorts And they seem easy to comply. Brian whispered Scientology to me, \"They are under the influence of medicine,\" Which is considered to be the worst thing that could happen in the world. But what I thought was probably a good idea. (Laughter) Then Brian said: \"Here's Tony.\" There was a man walking inside. He did not look fat, his body looked very good. He was not wearing these cotton sports pants, He was wearing a striped suit. His arm was outstretched Like a man exited from \"The Apprentice\" He looked like a man wanting to dress up Convince me that he is very sane. Sat down. I said \"So, is it true that you occupied to reach here?\" He said: \"Yes, yes. Of course. I hit someone when I was seventeen. I was in prison awaiting trial, My cellmate told me, Do you know what to do? Call madness. Tell them you're crazy. They will send you to any of the many hospitals. Where the nurses will bring you some pizza. You will own your PlayStation. \" So I said, \"Well, how did you do that?\" He said, \"I asked to see a prison psychiatrist. And you've watched a movie called \"Crash\" Where people get sexual pleasure by bumping cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \"I get sexual pleasure from bumping cars into walls.\" So I said, \"And what else?\" He said, \"Oh, yes. I told the psychiatrist I want to see women die Because it makes me feel normal. \u201d So I said, \"Where did you get that from?\" He said, \"Oh, from Ted Pandey's autobiography That they had in the prison library. \" In any case, he claimed the disease very well as he put it They did not send him to Wathira Hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the moment he got to this place, He said he took one look at the place, asked to see a psychiatrist, He said: \"There has been a terrible misunderstanding. I am not mentally ill. \" I said, \"How long have you been here?\" He said, \"Well, if I had implemented the sentence I was sentenced to imprisonment for my original crime, I would have taken five years. I've been to Broadmoor for 12 years. \" Tony said it is very difficult to convince people that you are sane To convince them that you are crazy. He said: \"I thought it was the best way to look natural You may be by talking to people naturally about natural topics Like football or what is shown on TV. I am subscribed to \"New Scientist\", And recently it had an article How the American army was training hummingbirds to smell explosives. So I said to one of the nurses, \"Do you know that the US Army trains hummingbirds? To sniff out explosives? \" When I read the medical notes written about me, I found that they wrote: \"It is believed that bees can sniff out explosives.\" He said, \"You know, they are always looking for Non-verbal signs of my mental condition. But how do you sit sane? How to put a leg on the other in a rational way? It is impossible. \" And when Tony said that to me, I thought, \"Am I sitting like a journalist? Should I put one leg over another like a journalist? \" He said, \"You know, on the one hand, I have the tendencies of a serial killer like Stockwell Strangler The \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" usurper is on the other side. So I tend to sit in my room a lot because I find them terrifying. They consider sitting for a long time in the room as a sign of madness. They say that this proves that I am lonely and arrogant. \" So, only in Bordmore, the unwillingness to go out and walk around with the serial killers It is a sign of madness. Anyway, it seemed completely normal to me. However, what do I know? When I got home, I sent an email to his doctor, Anthony Madden. I said, \"What is the story?\" He said: \"Yes. We accept that Tony claimed the story of madness to get out of prison Because of his hallucinations, which seemed vulgar to start with Which disappeared the moment Broadmoor entered. However, we have evaluated it. We have decided that what he is is that he is upset. \" And in fact, fake the madness It is precisely the kind of cunning and manipulative behavior of the disordered. She is on the list; cunning and manipulative. So claiming that your mind has something wrong It is evidence that your mind already has something wrong. I talked to other experts, They have said that the striped suit - a classic disordered mind. Speaking of points one and two in the list of symptoms; Sweet-spoken, superficial personality charm and a transcendent sense of self-worth. I said, \"Well, he didn't want to mix with other patients?\" Classical disordered, this is evidence of great feeling as well as a lack of sympathy for others. Hence, all things that looked more natural in Tony It was evidence, according to his doctors, However, he was ill in this new way. He was disturbed. His doctor told me, If you wanted to know more about psychopaths, You can go to the Psychopathology Training Course Run by Robert Hare, the man who invented a list of psychopathic symptoms. And that's what I did I went to a psychopathic discovery course, And now I'm certified-- And I must say, I am very skilled-- As a discoverer of psychopaths. Here are the statistics: One in every hundred ordinary people is psychopathic. Well, there are 1,500 people in this room. Fifteen of you are psychopathic. Note that this number increases to 4 percent From executives and businessmen. So I think there is a very good opportunity There would be 30 or 40 psychopathies in this room. A massacre could happen at the end of this night. (Laughter) (laughter) So Herr said that capitalism is at its extreme Rewards psychopathic behavior-- Lack of sympathy for others, sweet talk, Sly, disingenuous. In fact, capitalism is in its cruelest brutality, It is a physical embodiment of psychopathology. It is like the type of psychopathic That is affecting all of us. Hare said to me: \"You know what? Forget this person in Broadmoor And who may, or may not be a paranoia. who cares? This is not an important story. The important story, he says, is \"they are psychopathic companies.\" You need to interview some psychopath companies. \" So I made an attempt. I addressed people at Enron. I said, \"Can I have an interview with you in prison To find out if you are psychopathic? \" They did not respond to me. So I changed the tactic this time. I sent an email to Dunlap \"Electric Saw\" Originated since the 1990s. He was involved in companies that fell and cut 30 percent of the workforce Simply referring entire American towns to ghost towns. I sent an email to him and said: \"I think you have a very rare brain defect That makes you special And interested in predatory spirit and not to fear anything. Can I do an interview with you? About your rare brain defect? \u200b\u200b\" He said: \"Come.\" Then, I went to the great Dunlap Palace in Florida Which was filled with sculptures of predators. There were lions and tigers. He was taking me through the garden. There were falcons and eagles. He used to tell me: \"There are sharks.\" He was saying this in a less sinister way. \"There are also more sharks and more tigers.\" It was like the Kingdom of Narnia. (Laughter) Then we entered his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlop was being brought in to rescue the companies that went bankrupt. He was laying off 30 percent of the workforce. And he would often fire people from joke, For example, one of the most famous stories about him, Someone came to him and said, \"I just bought a new car.\" He replied, \"Maybe you have a new car, But let me tell you what you don't have, job. \" Well, in his kitchen, he was standing there with his wife Judy And his bodyguard Sean. I told him, \"I remember how I told you in the email Could there be a rare defect in your brain that makes you unique? \" He said: \"Yes, it is an amazing theory. It's like Star Trek. You go where no one has seen you before. \" I said, \"Well, some psychologists might say This makes you ... \"(grunts) (Laughter) He said \"What?\" I said \"psychopathic.\" And then I said, \"I have a full list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I pass it on with you? \" And he seemed very interested against his will, And he said \"Okay, go ahead.\" I said, \"Okay, a transcendent sense of self-worth.\" And what I have to say is that it was difficult to deny it Because he was standing under a giant oil painting drawn to his person. (Laughter) He said, \"Well, you have to believe in yourself!\" I said \"manipulative.\" He said \"This is the leadership.\" I said \"shallow expressions: Inability to express the extent of feelings. \" He said, \"Who wants to be burdened with some trivial feelings?\" So, he was passing the points on the psychopathic list Mainly turning it into \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" (Laughter) But I noticed something that happened to me on the day I spent with the Dunlap. Whenever he told me something he looked normal For example, he answered \"No\" to juvenile delinquency. He said he was accepted to West Point, They do not accept people with a history of events at West Point. And none answered in short marital relations. He only got married twice in his life. Acknowledging that his wife mentioned in her divorce papers He once threatened her with a knife. He said that as long as he wondered what the taste of human flesh is, But people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages at the height of verbal quarrels His second marriage lasted for 41 years. So, whenever he tells me about something that might seem non-psychopathic, I say to myself, well I won't put this in my book. Then I realized that by being a psychopath observer It has turned me a little into psychopaths. Because I was striving to squeeze it into a box that reads psychopathic I was striving to know him as crazy as possible. Then I realized, my God. This is what I have been doing for 20 years. This is what all journalists do. We travel around the world with our paper notes in our hands And we are waiting for jewelry. And jewelry is always a ceiling In the characters we meet. And we sew them together like medieval monks. We leave natural things on the ground. This is one of the countries that diagnoses many mental illnesses far more than the reality. Bipolar disorder in children - children four years old They are classified as bipolar disorder Because they have tantrums, Which makes them score high on the list of bipolar disorder. When I returned to London, Tony phoned me. He said, \"Why didn't you answer my calls?\" I said, \"Well, they say you are psychopathic.\" He replied, \"I am not psychopathic.\" He said \"Do you know what? One of the paragraphs in the list is the lack of remorse, While the other one on the list is furtive, manipulative. When you say that you regret your crime, They say; exactly like psychopathy Cunningly claiming that he feels remorse while he is not. \" It's like magic. They turn everything upside down. He said \"I have a trial soon. Can you come to it? \" I said well Then I went to trial After 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go out. They decided that he was not supposed to be held indefinitely Because its high scores on a list Which could mean that he has above-average chances of a reversal. So they let him go out. And outside in the hallway he told me, \"Do you know what, John? \"All people are somewhat psychopathic.\" He said \"You. I. Well, obviously I am.\" I said \"What are you going to do now?\" He said: \"I will go to Belgium Because there is a woman there I dream about. But she is married, so I will make her separate from her husband. (Laughter) Whatever it was, this was two years ago, And here is where my book ended. In the last 20 months, everything was fine. No bad thing happened. He lived with a girl outside London. It was, according to Brian the Scientologist, It replaces the past time - which I know looks sinister, But it is not necessarily doomed. Unfortunately, after 20 months, He returned to prison for a month. He got into a fight in a bar, as he called it-- Which ended up going to prison for a month, Which I know is bad, But it is at least one month that means whatever quarrel, It was not so bad. Then call me on the phone. Do you know what? I think it is right for Tony to be outside. Because we are not supposed to know people about their craziest limits. And what Tony is on is that he's semi-psychopathic. It is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find complexity, Where you find humanity And where you find the truth. Tony told me, John, can I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. \" I did not go. If you were me, what would you do? Thank you (clap)", "vuIlsN32WaE": "[Music]  right well I might get myself into a position here and on the red carpet I don't think I need to introduce myself do I but this is the last talk for the day we will have a little bit of wrap up after this and we will have a little time to to reflect and maybe some questions I know some of you will want to get home but let's get cracking because we've got about well probably 12 minutes is my talk maybe might go for 15 so don't panic if that thing goes over so here we go the mathematics of weight loss well let me start with this last year I went surfing in Fiji and the resort had a photographer following us around taking all these photos which was really great except that I couldn't help but notice this somehow I'd managed to become 5 kilograms overweight couldn't believe my eyes so I did what they tell you to do I ate less and I moved more and within just three months I discovered I'd lost 6 kilograms so then I did what a normal person does I did physics but anyone would do this I graphed my weight and when I did the linear regression I discovered that lo and behold on average I'd been losing 85 grams a day which got me thinking in fact it got me very curious about this question that I've since discovered most people have no clue about in fact they've never even thought about this and to prove my point I've made a little video on Bondi Beach and the question was this when somebody loses weight where does it go what does it become how does it get out of your body you're probably dumbstruck by the question these people were so listen to this where does it go where does the weight go  well well I don't know I don't know that I don't know the mysteries of science it gets used up the universe another dimension doesn't go anywhere it comes over to me becomes nothing don't exist anymore I guess that's a very good question question what it fascinating question what would you say it goes right in the crapper mate sweat moisture and sweat evaporates up a Bondi Beach that's where I go well basically you burn it up as energy darkness is energy heat energy burnt in energy yeah you got me there I'm not quite sure mmm so what the heck is going on we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic I don't need to tell you about it so why don't these people know the answer to this fundamental question because not one of them was right and we do know the answer this is not groundbreaking stuff I'm about to tell you so let me just remind you of a few things you do know what's the chemical formula for water h2o chemical formula for carbon dioxide you all know it right so you know what human fat is made of so what is the chemical formula for human fat there is such a thing believe it or not it's been known since the 60s it's C 55 H 104 oh six that's the chemical formula for the average fat molecule in a human body some of the molecules might have a few more carbon atoms and a few more hydrogen some might have less they all have just six oxygen atoms that's very important and helpful for later but this is the average fat molecule hate c55 hate 104 oh six so let's be very clear about this the difference between that and that is C 55 H 1 Oh 406 I kid you not the difference between that and that same thing c55 h1 Oh 406 so how does this stuff get out of a human body well here's the general equation looks pretty sort of interesting slightly complicated not if you've done some year 10 chemistry surely this is year 10 chemistry although well it's not really but here's what it says fat plus oxygen gives you carbon dioxide and water that's what it becomes and this biochemist have known this for ages you inhale that you exhale that that's what happens to it amazing now that little arrow there is kind of oversimplifying something called biochemistry that's three years at university and my apologies to the biochemist so that men doubt oversimplify but I'm trying to get to the crunch it's really complicated it doesn't just come out of you for no reason you've got to do stuff eat less move more what we'll come to that in a minute but look when you want to lose weight you want to lose kilograms that's all kilograms all that stuff there so what do people say heat it burns up as energy because that's what we've been telling them all this time and it's very confusing because energy has different units kilojoules or you might use calories and yes that's heat that's motion when you move or it's thinking your brain needs energy or it's growing but that's not where the fat goes so what are we talking about here well let me just show you a couple more things so I've got some carbon dioxide here in its frozen form we call it dry ice it's carbon dioxide it has mass thing is you're not used to seeing it but here's some dry ice and it's heavy and if you put it in water lo and behold it does this cool thing in bubbles like you've all seen that before well that's carbon dioxide in water that's what fat is kind of made out of but it's not fat I'm not making fat that is not fat so how does that become fat well it doesn't just like that it becomes sugar first plants make fat well they start the whole thing a plant takes six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water uses an amazing chemical called chlorophyll holds them together and then sunlight comes in and finds those molecules together and it becomes sugar c6h12o6 is glucose fructose same formula c6h12o6 sucrose is glucose plus fructose stuck together - and h2o molecule so it's do the maths c20 no 12h 2205 right well here some this is sucrose plants make it and it's this stuff joined together it's now got chemical energy holding these molecules together so they don't just fly around like that and by the way if you drink that 600 mil of lemon flavored soft drink you'll get 17 teaspoons of this stuff are in there I'll just quickly show what that looks like here's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 right so if you drink that it's the equivalent of doing what I just did with the spoon except munching it all down exactly the same no difference so if you do do that then what happens well let me explain something else that I've been telling kids for a little while and they get this so when you eat food it's not in your body straight away if you swallow that sugar it's not in you yet so here's a pool noodle right it's got a hole running through it and here's an almond and if we put the almond in there can go all the way through and out the other end whoop-dee-doo here's another almond if I put an almond in here is where's the almond you would say the almonds in the pool noodle okay but is it in the foam that the pool noodle is made of no of course not it's just in the hole that runs through it that's food you swallow food it's not in you it's in the hole that runs from here to the back door and getting food into you it's called digestion so with this stuff you've got to break the bond that's holding the fructose to the glucose and as soon as you do that then that stuff can cross the barrier or internal skin and into your body and then it can go around in your blood that's digestion but now it's not metabolism yet it's got to go into your cells and then you've got to burn it up and if you don't burn it up if you eat all that sugar after you've had your three meals in the day your body doesn't waste it doesn't come out here the stuff that comes out the back door was never in you apart from a few molecules of cholesterol it's just fiber that you couldn't digest plus the bacteria that live in your gut you lose about 500 billion of those in one single sitting they're tiny that's many times the population of the earth every time you flush the toilet it's amazing but that stuff was never really in you so here's what happens if you don't then metabolize that sugar well then it's going to get converted into the stuff that we all have a problem with fat now better just prove that you do breathe breathe this stuff out right if you metabolize sugar you turn it back into carbon dioxide and water so every time you exhale out comes a bit of carbon dioxide you can't see it this is the problem this is why people don't know how you lose weight so there you go of traps and breath I've inhaled that 5% of the air in there is now carbon dioxide because it's come out of my lungs I've got some liquid nitrogen here and I'm going to use that to freeze this air liquid nitrogen is minus 196 very handy um where did I write that in fact I'll just pour it straight on so be a little bit careful with this stuff I use it all the time if I look a little blase I don't mean to it's please respect this stuff if you play with it the way you would respect boiling hot water now if you pour it onto a balloon the balloon does not pop which is incredible the nitrogen is minus 196 oxygen turns into a liquid at minus 183 so the oxygen in the balloon is turning into liquid carbon dioxide turns solid I've got a big bowl of it there but it turns solid at minus 78 so in the balloon now I have frozen well I have liquefied oxygen and frozen carbon dioxide I'm gonna take it out you'll see them so I'll just take a while for the balloon to go a little bit clear at the top the nitrogen in here air is 79% nitrogen the nitrogen is in the top of the balloon but now look at that liquid down there can you see that that's the oxygen from my breath that I hadn't used but once it's all gone there'll be some white powder left right the white powder is breakfast that's the carbon dioxide the carbon atoms I ate in the last 24 hours and when I blow on them they get warm enough to turn back into gas and they vanish and people think there's nothing in the balloon the balloon has mass those atoms have mass you can see carbon dioxide has mass when you solidified but when you breathe it out you don't see it and we've been confusing people by talking about kilojoules or calories and they're really important but people do not seem to understand that when you lose weight you're losing atoms you can't just turn atoms into nothing in fact science teachers out there you need to change the way you teach chemistry because those people and many in this room think that you can turn atoms into energy well it's one of the founding principles of modern chemistry you cannot turn an atom into pure energy it's called the conservation of mass before a reaction and after a reaction we teach kids you've got to have the same number of atoms it's called stoichiometry well we haven't been teaching it very well at all because people think you can turn fat which is kilograms into nothing or just kilojoules can't do it so he was my big fat question I'm a physicist I knew that bit but my question was if I've got 10 kilograms of this stuff then how much carbon dioxide does that become and how much water and turns out that that's really simple - this is year 10 chemistry and year 10 maths you need the periodic table of elements you have to look up hydrogen carbon and oxygen there they are now the periodic table has some important information on it the weight of a single atom of these elements so the weight of a single atom of carbon is twelve point zero zero one zero one one atomic mass units doesn't matter what they are in kilograms just yet I'll show you why in a minute we've got 55 of those in a average fat molecule so there's six hundred sixty point five nine what about the hydrogen okay there's a hundred and four of those so we have in one molecule of fat 104 point eight three atomic mass units okay great the oxygen is a little trickier this stumped me for quite some time in fact I rang around and I couldn't get a very clear answer on this because it doesn't seem that many biochemists have thought about it this way that's not because they're silly or whatever they just haven't thought about it in this way which really surprised me because this bit of information is the most motivating bit of information I had in my personal little journey of losing seventeen kilograms in six months it's all gone breathe it out amazing you could anyone can do this it's not hard so how much carbon dioxide and water well the oxygen is important there's six atoms of it in a molecule but what are they going to become are they gonna go out as carbon dioxide are they gonna go as water are they going some ratio of the two how do you figure this out took me ages and then the answer turned up in a very old paper from the 1940s where they'd taken water labelled the oxygen atoms made them put some an isotope of oxygen on to those and oxygen 18 gave it to mice the mice had it go in their belly but then it came out in their breath so water had the oxygen in it but then that oxygen turned up in the exhaled breath which showed that oxygen atoms are exchanged between carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules there's a really good reason for that here's some phenylthaline in water it's a bit hard to pronounce it's got a bit murky because I've left it sit but look if your barn here changes color great whoop-dee-doo what does it show you show you the carbon dioxide dissolves in water forms carbonic acid there's an exchange of oxygen atoms so what this told me is that the way these six atoms are going to leave your body is in the same ratio that they exist in the molecule so that's a two to one ratio so that means four will go out as carbon dioxide and two go it is water that's great now I know the answer so now you do the maths so we've got the first two answers I'm gonna add to the carbons the weight of four of these oxygen atoms they're gonna go out with carbon so check that up there and I've got two to go so two times that there we go check that with the hydrogen's because they're gonna go out with some hydrogen and now I can figure out the ratio of carbon dioxide and water from my fat so there's the totals and now we've just got to divide it by the total total and you get 84% will go out as carbon dioxide and 16% will go out as water so here's the answer then to my big fat question 84% of fat is exhaled 16% is excreted as water somehow it can be in your urine and your feces sweat that means that 10 kilograms of fat becomes eight point four kilograms of invisible gas that you breathe out that's amazing every time you're doing some exercise and your breathing rate goes up you're losing more weight than when you're sitting down and not breathing as rapidly and one point six kilograms will come out as water now we don't know if that comes out in your poo or in your where and your sweater in your tears because you cry a lot who knows but now I've got some frequently asked questions that I need to answer because there's lots of them well there's three main ones one can I just surround a breathe more everyone asks me straight away well you can't sit around and breathe more but it's called hyperventilation you've got a coax 4c 55 h1 Oh 406 out of the fat cells they're called adipocytes and to do it biochemistry made it amazing what really goes on it's a long story but you need to get them out by first of all moving more or eating less you've got to sort of starve yourself of energy so that you start turning these big molecules of fat they get broken into three fatty acids each they're called a triglyceride but they have to be broken apart before they can come out of the cells the hidey-holes that they live in in your bingo wings or you have double chins or your butter your muffin tops or wherever it is it's hanging around in there it's not going to come out until this hormone breaks them apart into its fatty acids it goes into your bloodstream and then you can oxidize them beta oxidation big long story really complicated amazing that we know but FAQ number two is does weight loss cause climate change well this is another really disturbing little thing because it means people don't understand climate change they just don't because if you did you wouldn't even think that but people think so why doesn't it cause climate change because food was made by plants just in the last couple of years and the way it did it was it took sunlight and glued water to carbon dioxide when you eat you're actually the energy is sunlight it was put there by the Sun if I wasn't well I'm not a hippie but I just about am because I think that this is amazing you eat sunlight that's the energy that you get but it's modern sunlight when you burn fossil fuels that's ancient sunlight it's locked up in the ground as carbon in wood Deadwood ancient fossilized coal and oil is ancient dead fossilized critters that lived in the sea that photosynthesize that died that got buried that eventually turned it all this does not cause climate change and the fact that people don't know that means we need to teach them more about climate change no wonder there are so many myths about both these things there are myths about weight loss there are so many diet gurus out there mate if they didn't know this are you gonna trust anything else they have to say to you no hopefully not stop buying their books that pills their rubbish why did you not know this until today I don't know the answer but it certainly makes me very very skeptical about any health claim that anyone makes who's supposedly a guru the third question that you don't get asked but I should get asked that I don't get asked at all except the biochemist would be sitting there wondering it right now did you take into account ketosis and no not really I did not ketosis is when you starve yourself of carbohydrates when there's no glucose in your blood and you can do this thing called ketogenesis your liver does it and can convert fat molecules into ketone bodies there acetone is one of them you go to a nail shop get your nail polish removed acetone right your body makes that stuff but you don't want to make it in huge quantities because you go into acidosis so I'm not going to comment on whether or not eating low protein diets is a good idea because I'm not an expert on that I would say that I'd be careful because it's linked to depression apparently in some papers I don't know I'm not making any health claims about low protein diets what I'm saying is that this is very simple if you just do what I did and what lots and lots and lots of other people I don't want to meddle it's easy all you have to do to lose weight is turn it into carbon dioxide and water and to do that all you have to do is eat less move more and keep reading thank you  you", "d0yGdNEWdn0": "Translator: Ahmed AbouZaid Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla Those present behind, do you hear me clearly? Well, excellent. Have you ever been preoccupied with a question? For a long time until it becomes part of your thinking? Maybe even part of you as a person? Well, I had a question on my mind for many years How can we accelerate the learning process? It is really an interesting question Because if you can learn faster, It will take less time in school. And if you learn really quickly You may not need to go to school at all. Now, when I was young, the school was ok but ... I often noticed that the school was a barrier to the education process I had this question in my mind: How do we learn faster? And it started when I was very, very young, When I was eleven years old, I wrote a letter to researchers in the Soviet Union, asking them about Hypnopaedia, That is, learning while sleeping, You bring a tape recorder, and place it beside your bed Then you turn it on at night While you sleep, You are supposed to learn from this. Good idea, but unfortunately it does not work! However, learning during sleep opened the doors for researchers in other areas We had a great discovery about The education that started with the first question. From there, I became passionate about psychology And I participated in psychology in many different ways For the rest of my life up to this point. In 1981, she went to China I decided that I would be at the level of Native Chinese speakers within two years Now, you have to understand in 1981, everyone thought The Chinese are really very difficult And that the Western person may study for 10 years or more He is not even close to being good at it. I also thought of a different idea And that was: taking all the conclusions From psychology research until that time And apply them to the learning process Which was really cool, as I became fluent in Mandarin Chinese within 6 months It took a little longer to reach the level of the native speakers But I looked around and saw all of these from different countries Suffering terribly with the Chinese, I saw Chinese people terribly suffering to learn English and other languages, So a question was as follows: How to help ordinary adults To learn a new language quickly, easily, and efficiently? Now this is a really important question in today's world We have enormous challenges with the environment We have enormous challenges with social disintegration, With wars, all the things that happen And if we can't communicate, We will have difficulty solving these problems. So we need to be able to speak each other's languages, This is very, very important. The question then is: How can we do that? Well, it's really easy. Look around and find people who are already doing it, Find cases that actually work with them Then the principles can be defined and applied. It's called modeling, and I'm starting to look at language learning And he has worked as a model for language learning between 15 and 20 years now. My conclusion and my remarks from that Any adult can learn a second language fluently within 6 months. Now when I say that, most people think I'm crazy, and that is not possible. So, let me remind everyone of the history of human progress It is all about expanding our borders. In 1950, everyone thought it was impossible to run a mile in four minutes, And then, Roger Banster did that in 1956 From there it became shorter and shorter. 100 years ago, everyone believed that heavy things could not fly. However, she can and we all know that. How heavy things can fly? We reorganized the materials using principles we learned From observing nature, birds are in this state. And today we went even further ... We went further, so the car could fly. You can buy one of these cars for a few hundred thousand dollars. Now in this world we have cars that can fly. There are different ways of flying that we learned from squirrels, So all you need to do is copy what the flying squirrel does. Create a suit called a wing suit and here you go, you can fly like a squirrel. Now most people, many people, and I will not tell all people But many people think they cannot draw. However there are some basic principles, five principles that you can apply To learn to draw, and can actually learn to draw in five days. So, if you draw this way, you can learn these principles in five days And applying them and after five days you can draw something like this. Now I know this is true because that was my first drawing Five days after applying these principles, that was what I could do. And I looked at this and then reached: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh cool! So that is how I look when I focus intensively My mind is exploding. \" So, anyone can learn to draw in five days In the same way, in the same logic, Anyone can learn a second language in six months. How? There are five principles and seven verbs There may be more but definitely this essential. And before I go into them I just want to talk about two myths, I want to refute two myths. First, you need talent. Let me tell you about Zoe. Zoe came from Australia, to the Netherlands, and she was trying to learn Dutch, She suffered so terribly ... She suffered so much Finally people said: \"You are completely useless,\" You're not talented, give up, you're a waste of time. She was very disappointed. Then I discovered those five principles, I moved to Brazil and applied them And during 6 months she was fluent in Portuguese, Thus, talent does not matter. People also believe that immersion in a new country is a way to learn the language. But look in Hong Kong, look at all these Westerners Who had been there for 10 years, and they didn't speak a single Chinese word. Look at all of these Chinese who live in America, Britain, Australia and Canada They were between 10 and 20 years old and never spoke English. Indulging in itself is of no use. Why? Because the drowned can't learn to swim! When you don't speak a language, you are like a child. And if you put yourself in the middle of the context Where all adults talk about things above your level, you will not learn. So, what are the five principles that need attention? The first: the four words, Attention, meaning, relationship, memory, And the connection between them is very important. Especially when you are talking about learning. Come with me on a trip through a forest. She walks through the woods And you see something like this ... little marks on a tree, Maybe you care, maybe not. You walk another 50 meters and see this ... You have to be careful. After another 50 meters, if you don't show interest, you see this ... And at this point, you will pay attention. And I knew that ... important, It is relevant because it means that, All relevant, i.e. information related to your survival Are the things you will pay attention to So you will remember it. If it is related to your personal goals, Then you will pay attention to it. If relevant, you will be notified. So, the first rule, the first principle for learning a language Focus on your language content. Which leads us to the tools. We master the tools with them and we learn the tools faster When it is relevant to us. So let me share my story. The keyboard is a tool. Writing Chinese in a certain way there are ways for that. This is the tool. I had a colleague several years ago. She was going to night school; Tuesday night, Thursday night, Two hours at a time, practice at home, She spent nine months, not learning how to write Chinese. One night we got in trouble. We have 48 hours to deliver a training manual in Chinese. And I got to work, I can assure you In 48 hours, she was able to learn to write Chinese Because it was related to it, it was meaningful and important, She was using some tool to create value. So the second principle for learning a language is to use that language As a tool for communication from the first day Just as the child does. When I first arrived in China, I didn't speak a single Chinese word, And in my second week, I decided to take the train. I spent eight hours sitting in the food cart I am talking to a guard on the train, For some reason he has shown an interest in me, We spoke all night in Chinese He used to draw pictures and make movements with his hands And facial expressions slowly I understood more and more. But the wonderful thing was, two weeks later, When people were speaking Chinese around me, You understand some of this I did not make any effort to learn that. What happened is that I got sucked that night on the train, Which leads us to the third principle. When you first understand the message, Then you acquire the language without knowing it. And this is really documented now, This is called cognitive input. There is 20 to 30 years of research on this, Stephen Krachen, pioneer in this field, And publish all kinds of different studies And this is just one of them. Purple bars show scores on different language tests. The people in purple are the ones who learned the rules and formal study, People in green are the ones who learned about cognitive inputs. So perception works. Perception is the key Learning a language is not about accumulating a lot of knowledge. In many and many cases it comes to physiological (organic) training. A woman I know from Taeyeon did well in English while at school. I got privilege in all stages, Going through college, I got a concession, I went to the United States She found that she couldn't understand what people were saying. And people started asking her: \"Are you deaf?\" It was! Deaf in English. Because we have filters in our brain that filter The sounds used to Sounds are filtered from languages \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039that we do not know. And if you can't hear it, you can't understand it, If you cannot understand it, you will not learn it. So you should be able to hear these sounds. There are ways to do this, but they are physiological exercises. Speech uses muscles. You have 43 muscles in your face, You have to organize them in a way It enables you to make sounds that others can understand. If you do any new sports for several days, And you know how your body feels? hurt? If your face hurts, you do it the right way. The last principle is the case. Self-membership status. If you are sad, angry, worried, or upset, you will not learn! is over. If you are happy, relaxed, and in an alpha state of mind, and curiously, You will learn really fast, Specifically, you need to be tolerant of unclear. If you are one of the people who need to understand 100 percent Every word they hear, you will feel weary, Because you will always be very upset, because you are not perfect. If you are understanding that you know some people, and you are not familiar with others, Just pay attention to what you already understand. You will be fine, relaxed, and you will learn quickly. So, based on these five principles, what are the seven actions you should do? Number one: listen a lot. I call him dipping the brain. Put yourself in context Where you hear tons, tons and tons of a language It does not matter if you understand it or not. You listen to rhythms, to patterns that repeat, You listen to the things that stand out. (Chinese) Bao Naoseh (Arabic) So, just dip your mind in this. The second verb is to know the meaning first, Even before knowing the words. Try it: \"Well how do you do that? I don\\'t know the words!\" Well, you understand the meaning of these different situations. Human communication is body language in many ways, much of body language. From body language you can understand a lot of communication, Thus, you understand, you are gained through cognitive input. And you can use patterns that you already know. If you speak Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese and go to Vietnam, You will understand 60 percent of what they say to you in the daily conversation, Because Vietnamese is 30 percent Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese. Third verb: start mixing. Perhaps you have never thought about it But if you know 10 verbs, 10 nouns, and 10 adjectives, You can say 1000 different things. Language is a creative process. What do young children do? Well, \"me,\" \"pigeon,\" \"now.\" Well, this is how they communicate. So start mixing, create, and have fun with it, You don't have to be perfect, the important thing is that it works. And when you do that, you focus on the crux of the matter. what does that mean? Well, any language is a highly repetitive content. In English 1000 words cover 85 percent From anything you will say in daily communication. 3000 words give you 98 percent From anything you will say in the daily conversation. If you get 3000 words, you speak the language. The rest are additional improvements. And when you start with a new language, Start with your toolbox. Week number one, In your new language, you say things like: \"How do you say that?\" \"I do not understand\" What do you mean by that? In all of your target languages You use it as a tool, make it useful to you, It is relevant to learn other things about language. By the second week, you should say things like: \"I\", \"this\", \"you\", \"that\", \"give\", \"you know\", \"hot\" Simple pronouns, simple nouns, simple verbs, Simple qualities, communicating like a small child. By the third or fourth week, you start with \"pasting words\". Despite, but, and thus, these are the strapping tools That links language, and allows you to make more complex meanings. At that point you are speaking. And when you do that, you have to get a language father. If you look at how children and parents interact, You will understand what this means. When a child talks, he uses simple words, simple structures. Sometimes it looks very strange, sometimes with strange pronunciation, Other people outside the family do not understand it. But the parents understand. Thus the child has a safe environment, and he obtains confidence. Parents talk to the child using body language And with simple language, they know that the child understands. So you have a safe cognitive input environment, We know this will work; otherwise, none of you will speak his native language. So I get a language father, He is a person who takes care of you personally Who will contact you mainly naturally, But he is interested in helping you understand the message. There are four rules for a parent of a language. The couple is not good at this! OK? But the four rules are, First of them, they will work hard to understand what you mean Even if you were wrong. Second, they will not correct your mistakes. Third, they will tell you what they understand what you say So that you can respond appropriately and understand their notes Then they will use words you know. The sixth thing you have to do is copy the face. You have to make the muscles work properly, So you can make sounds in a way that people can understand you. There are a few things you can do. One is to hear the feeling, to feel the sound Which means that you have a cycle of reactions happening in your face, But ideally if you can look at the speaker in his native language And notice how they use their faces, Let your unconscious mind understand the rules, Then, then, you will be able to use it. And if you can't look at a native speaker, you can use things like ... (Female voice) Singing, song, king, stubborn, suspended. (Chris Lonsdale) And the last idea here, the last act you need to do Something I call \"direct contact\". What does this mean? Well, most people learn a second language Somehow they take the words of their mother tongue and the new language and move between them Time and time again in their minds to try and remember these words. This is completely ineffective. What you need to do is realize that Everything you know is a picture in your mind, it is feelings, If you talk about fire, you can smell smoke, You can hear the crackling, you can see the flame, So what you do, is you go inside these visualizations and all that memory And you exit another path. So I call it \"the same box, with a different path.\" You exit this path and build it over time, Become more skilled at connecting new sounds With these pictures that you already have, in your inner mind. As time passes you become better naturally in this process, Where he spoke unconsciously. So, there are five principles you need to work on, and seven verbs, If you do any of them, you will get better. And remember that these things are in your hands as a learner. Do them all, and you will be fluent in the second language within six months. thank you (clap)", "gn4bvjMh4vc": "Translator: Amany Allam Auditor: Riyad Almubarak Today I'm going to talk about a theory you haven't heard of before, And I hope that by the end of the conversation you will share my opinion, That no one mentioned this, However, he changed the world and still changes the world. This is called the garrison hypothesis. An idea that has evolved over hundreds of years, It became more popular in the 19th century, But it still affects parts of the world today, especially Africa. This is the subject of my book, To be published within months, Entitled The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, scientists, and theory that changed a continent. This story - Well, I should tell you that I'm a historian of exploration, This is my job. I'm looking at explorers, missions, And cultural encounters between people around the world, And why do people at home believe the importance of these missions? And the story of the missing white tribe that I'm going to talk about, And the garrisoning hypothesis, I grew up from a book I wrote ten years ago Entitled \"Frost Crucible\", it was about exploring the Arctic. I could not imagine that this book is about the Arctic It will lead me to my current project, Because it was about the Arctic, And the garrisoning hypothesis is about Africa, But it originated from part of the previous topic. I was writing about exploring the Arctic. I was particularly interested in American explorers, And how it happened in the 19th century If American explorers find something interesting to go to the Arctic, It is a very dangerous place. Many Americans lost their lives by going there, Either they try to find a northwest passage or reach the North Pole. But I found the story of an explorer named Wilhelmor Stephenson, And he went to the Arctic, Not to get to the North Pole but to discover new peoples. When he was in the upper Canada region In a place called Victoria Island, Discover a group of Eskimos that they described upon their return By being the Eskimo blond. I thought this story was the most bizarre one, but I couldn't stop reading about it. Stories were widespread in the United States at the time. In fact, the world press spoke On the blond Eskimo on Victoria Island. Some people thought that it was a fabrication, And it is a hoax. Others thought It is an amazing discovery that needs explanation. But this story was not helpful to me, It had nothing to do with what I write about. So I put it in a file, And what I found was that for the next six years, I was finding more From the stories about these white tribes That people around the world have discovered. For example in Panama, (Richard Marsh) found a group called the White Indians. In Central Asia, There is a group of people who say they have found Tibetans who look like Aryans. And in parts of Africa, people found white tribes as well. And in Japan, people discovered in the late 19th century A group called the Ainu on the northern island of Japan, They are said to resemble Caucasians. So by 2008, I had a huge file on discoveries of strange white tribes, And I thought it was time to do something about it. But there was one story that I particularly interested in, It was a story of discovery Happened in East Africa in the 1970s - In this red square - It happened west of Lake Victoria, One of the largest lakes in the world, It was discovered by one of the most famous explorers, Henry Morton Stanley. And Stanley may be known to you as the person who found Livingston, Or who saved Livingston in the heart of Africa in 1869. In fact, the phrase \"I think you are Dr. (Livingston)?\" Stanley told her to Livingston when they met. This was one of the most famous missions of the 19th century. But Stanley has returned to Africa many times, And on this subsequent mission to Africa, He didn't go to find Livingston, But to discover the sources of the Nile. He taught people at the end of the 19th century With so many lakes in East Africa, This is what we call the Rift Valley in East Africa. And this rift from the lakes will be the source of the Nile, This is what geographers have searched for 2000 years. But (Stanley) said: \"I will find out which of these lakes are the source.\" So he made his way into East Africa, and set with great confidence Lake Victoria is the main source of the Nile, This is the source of 4,000 miles from the Nile. But he also discovered something that formed a new mystery, That is, there were members of the African Recruits Squad That protects him with white skin, He called them \"Greeks in white shirts.\" It did not understand how these Africans had light skin. And he asked other members of his campaign, \"Who are these men?\" They said: \"They came from the mountains in the west, From a mountain called (Gambaragara). \" So he wrote about it and sent these reports back home, And illustrations of his story show Mount Gambaragara In the upper left with the illustration, And you can see it in the background. And this story has become famous in the homeland, This is the lost white vein Stanley found in Africa. How for heaven Stanley was able to explain it at the end of the 18th century? What kind of theoretical background or information could people use? Why would you find a group of whites living in the heart of Africa? In fact, for Stanley as a 19th-century man, In the transition period Between using the Bible to explain world history And use science to explain world history. So when Stanley thought about it, He regained the look of the Middle Ages, When people try to explain the differences That we see in the people of the world, and we call them ethnic differences, Going back to the books of Genesis, especially Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story, And in the story of Noah, we all heard about Noah and the flood, But most people do not know what happened after the flood, As Noah's Ark settled above Mount Ararat, Where he got off the ship with his family and three sons, Sam, Japheth and Ham. It was the three sons who believed many people in the Middle Ages - And so I talk about Jews, Christians, and Muslims - All of them believed this story as an explanation How to rebuild the Earth after its destruction in Genesis 9. And as you can see here, This medieval map shows Noah's three sons On the three known continents of the world. Asia, upstairs - and as you can see the ship is upstairs, Hanging on top of Mount Ararat - Wissam bin Noah, and to him attributed Semitic. Then down to the left of Europe - This map has been rotated to the east, by the way - On the left, you can see Europe and Japheth. Then the origin of all the Africans, as people thought, They were descendants of Ham. So when Stanley talks about this white tribe, he says: \"Somehow, they must be linked to the Ham tribe.\" And they became known as the protectors. But this is a transitional point, (Stanley) was a deft man Not only was he reading the Bible, but he was familiar with Darwin as well, And he was reading (Charles Lyle), who started, logically, He opposes world history in the Bible. People like Darwin and Lyle said The world was not 6000 years old, but hundreds of thousands of years - And they had no idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039the actual age of the world, But it was very old, moreover Races were not constant over time, but they changed over time, In fact, humans may have been similar to something else. So (Stanley) started adopting old ideas And merging them with new ideas. And many people did the same at the time. Strangely, the protective hypothesis, It is an idea that all Africans descended from the descendants of Ham Ibn Noah, Strangely changed to \"No, not all protectors are African, The protectors are a white group that invaded in the past, This invasion of eggs Explains why white tribes are found all over the world. \" Now, if this sounds weird, let me just emphasize something, This was not a weak idea, like You know, scientists looking for strange beings Or who are trying to prove cold fusion. There were anthropologists, linguists, paleontologists, All kinds of scholars in this field Take care of it. This map, for example An anthropologist called Griffith Taylor, And who is trying to describe what he saw Such as the ethnic dispersion of Asian groups around the world. Now what you see looks like a rounded map, But just to direct you here, the center of the map is Asia. And as you can see, There are initial outflows from dark races. Now, I think (Griffith Taylor) That the first races of the human race were primitive, Late races were more developed. And like most Europeans and Americans in the 19th century, When they considered primitive and evolving, They looked at it from a racist perspective, And primitive means dark skin, and sophisticated means light skin. So they made a color map of the world, To give you another example, he named that similar to the lava flow, That all races of humankind started in Asia, And gradually The most advanced late races, meaning white race It prevailed over other races and spread Where it conquered, overcame and prevailed On people of dark races around the world, Whether by mating with them or by invading them. So this was the idea that explained Why are white tribes found in strange places? That was well matched With what was happening at the end of the 19th century, As new white clans seized other places in the world. As the Europeans went mad to own the colonies From Asia to Africa. In fact, this map of Africa is from the end of the 19th century Color icons appear here They are different colors for European countries: Brown for France, green for Great Britain, blue for Belgium, and purple for Germany. It divided Africa as a whole among European countries In light of their attempts to establish colonies. So the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039a white ancestor previously did the same I agreed with the way the Europeans thought of this period, And when the European colonists came to these regions in Africa, And they saw different groups of Africans, they said: \"These are the protectors, these are the first whites. Let's treat them differently About black Africans. \" So during the end of the 19th century, Some groups like Bahima and Patosi in Rwanda, And (Nyamwazi) in Tanzania were laying eggs, And other groups such as (Bhutto) in Rwanda They were classified as black. Now, at that time Africans did not have the same racist outlook, right? And they were thinking about ethnic and tribal, However, these ideas have spread. This has allowed Europeans and Americans When they saw the great legacy of African civilizations, For example, when they looked at Great Zimbabwe or the pyramids, They said, \"It is clear that blacks cannot make these things. It must have been made by the garrison, right? These sophisticated old white invaders Who have been here for thousands of years. So this hypothesis has become a protector A way to explain and justify white colonialism, And all of these wonderful things that exist in Africa, It was robbed of the Africans themselves. There is a very dark side to the Hamitic hypothesis, It is this: Even after the Europeans left Africa in the 1960s And these countries became independent, And after it became clear that the hypothesis was garrison Absolutely incorrect, Even after this time The Africans themselves have embraced the Hamitic hypothesis As part of their history. For example, (Albatosi) in Rwanda They were considered to be of non-African descent, And other groups in Africa did the same. The (Irakawa) of Tanzania considered themselves to be of Mediterranean descent, Not African. And this ethnic conflict between the two groups He became a master in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. It was easier for the Hutus to see (Albatosi) as foreigners, As invaders to their non-African country, This made it easier for them to annihilate them. I am not saying that that was the only cause of the genocide in Rwanda, But it was one of the most important factors. This is the sad side of the story. But there is another side that I would like to end with, It is an exciting aspect of the story, Which is that we didn't ask the original question, If these things are not true, If Stanley hadn't seen white people in the heart of Africa? What did he see? So I went to Africa in 2013, And I actually climbed this mountain, which Stanley was looking at, Which I was not prepared for at all. I mean, I run, and I thought I was doing well, But the height of this mountain is 5,000 meters! There is a freezer on top, and I wasn't ready for that. But here I am before reaching this point. (Laughter) And as I told my mentor, I wanted to see what Stanley saw, But my mentor, who was from the Bakunzo tribe, looked at me And he said, \"There are no eggs on top of this mountain, man!\" (Laughter) And I said, \"I know there is none.\" But I want to think about what Stanley saw. You have reached a conditional hypothesis, and this hypothesis is: I think Stanley saw differences, I think he looked at people and said, \"These people are not like these.\" We now know that in terms of human diversity, Africa is the most diverse continent in the world. There is human diversity, that is to say physical diversity, in Africa More than anywhere else Because in Africa there is a long period of development For human races more than outside. So I think he saw differences between people, he thought - This is my own theory and I am very proud of it - Think about what I call Mr. Mago's hypothesis. (Laughter) So for those of you who are too young to remember Mr. Mago, It was similar to Don Quixote He was so shortsighted that you could put him in a room, He will not know his location, and thinks that he is somewhere else, Whenever he hit something in the room, Interpret this as if it were elsewhere Because his expectations about his whereabouts were very strong In a way that influenced understanding about it. I suspect that all explorers - and perhaps all tourists - Suffer from Mr. Mago's hypothesis, Where they describe everything they see Through their expectations of what it should be. And I think Stanley He wanted to see people like him, and Europeans like him. He was very lonely, having stayed in Africa for three years, Often without anyone from Europe or North America, And I think he wanted people like him And he saw this difference - in the bones of the face, the hooked nose, or the lighter complexion - And attributed this to white race. And finally, to finish, why should we remember this hypothesis? Well, it was a written test of how people viewed the world at the time. But I think we have to remember the hot hypothesis Because when we think of the main race and Aryan domination, We remember the very short violent period of Nazi Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, But in reality, there was a longer time and a deeper racial hypothesis It still exists today, and it is the protective hypothesis.

We are less inclined to accept a settlement This means that we no longer hear each other We make decisions about where we live Who will we marry, even who will be our friends? Based on what we really think. Again, that means we don't listen to each other Conversation requires a balance between talking and listening And somewhere along the way, we lost this balance. Part of this is due to technology Smartphones that are either in your hands Or close enough so that it can be eaten quickly.

Many of them, most of them, are more likely to communicate text messages with their friends From having an oral conversation with them face to face There\\'s a beautiful piece in \"The Atlantic\" It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. He gave his students a contact project He wanted to teach them how to talk about one subject without using notes He said: \"I came to a realization .. (Laughter) \"I came to the realization that conversational efficiency Perhaps the most overlooked skill was our failure to teach her Everyday, children spend hours exchanging ideas with each other through screens But they rarely find the opportunity To hone the interpersonal skills of relationships and communication This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any skill in the 21st century?

I talk to people I like. And I talk to people I don't like. I talk to some of the people I deeply disagree with on a personal level. But I can still have a great conversation with them. So I want to spend the next ten minutes teaching you how to talk. And how do you listen Many of you have heard a lot of advice on this Things like looking at a person directly in the eye Think of interesting topics to discuss in advance Like, shake the head in the affirmative and smile to show that you are interested Repeat or summarize what you heard So, I want you to forget all these tips Because she is stupid (Laughter) Because there is no reason to learn to show that you are attentive, alert and interested If you really care (Laughter) (clap) Currently, I am actually using the same skills as someone who conducts professional interviews As I do in normal life So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people This will really help you learn to be a better speaker Learn to have a conversation Without wasting your time, Without feeling bored And please, without offending anyone We all had a really great conversation. We did it before, and we know how it is. The kind of conversation you feel after engagement and inspiration, Or when you feel you have made a real connection Or, you have been fully understood. There is no reason Why most of our dealings are not like that. So, I have 10 basic rules. I will accompany you through every rule, But frankly, if you pick and master one of them, You will have better conversations already. The first rule: Do not multitask And here I do not mean to leave your smartphone only Or leave your mobile device, your car keys or whatever in your hand. I mean, be around. Be present at the same moment. Don't think about the argument you had with your boss Don't think about what to have for dinner If you want to get out of the conversation Exit the conversation But not half of it is present and half outside Second: Do not express your opinion as if you were an expert on the topic If you want to express your opinion Without any opportunity to respond, argue, block or grow, Write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there is a really good reason why I don't allow critics to appear on my program: Because they are really boring. If they were from the conservative party, they would hate Obama and the food stamps and abortion. If they were liberal, they would hate big banks And the oil companies, and Dick Cheney. Completely predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You want to get into the conversation assuming you have something to learn. The doctor said to the famous psychiatrist \"Scott Beck\": Real listening requires a person to set themselves aside. Sometimes that means putting your personal opinion aside. And he said, he senses this acceptance It will make the speaker become less horse And more likely to show internal mysteries For his mind to the listener. Again, suppose you have something to learn. Bill Nye said: \"Everyone you meet will know something that you don\\'t know.\" I put it this way: Everyone is expert about something. The third rule: use open-ended questions. In this case, this feature was taken from journalists. Start your question with whom, what, when, where, why or how. If you ask a complex question, you will get a simple answer. If I asked you, \"Did you get scared?\" You will respond to the strongest word in the sentence, It is the word \"fear\". And the answer will be \"Yes, I was afraid\" or \"No, I didn\\'t hide.\" \"Were you angry?\" \"Yes, I was very angry.\" Let them describe it. They know what. Try to ask them questions like: \"What was that?\" \" How did you feel?\" Because after that they will have to pause for a moment to think about it. And you'll get a much more interesting response. Fourth rule: go with the current. This means that ideas will come to your mind And you need to let her out of your mind. Often times we hear interviews The guest is speaking for several minutes Then the host interrupts him with a question What seems to be out of context, and has already been answered. This means that the host stopped listening two minutes ago Because he thought about this very smart question, He was determined and determined to say it. We do the exact same thing. We're sitting here having a conversation with someone, And we remember that time we saw Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop. (Laughter) And stop listening. We are awaiting the moment we enter the story into the conversation About Hugh Jackman and coffee. Stories and ideas will definitely come to you. You need to let her come and go. The fifth rule: If you do not know, say that you do not know. Now, people are on the radio, especially NPR More aware that they are under registration, So they are very careful about what they claim to be expert about And they claim they know him for sure. Do it, be careful. Talk should not be cheap. The sixth rule: Your experience is not equal to their experience. If they are talking about losing a family member. Don't start talking about the time when you lost a family member. If they talk about the problems they face at work, Do not talk about how you hate your work. It's not the same thing. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And most importantly, the conversation is not about you. You don't need to take a moment to prove how amazing you are. Or how much I suffered and suffered. Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was and said: \"I have no idea that people who show off their wits are unsuccessful.\" (Laughter) The talks are not a promotional opportunity. [21st century talks] [How are you today?] [Read my blog!] The seventh rule: Try not to repeat yourself. It is an amusement, and it is really boring. We tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or when we talk with our children. We have a point we want to make clear. So we reformulate it over and over again. Do not do it. Number eight: stay away from weeds. Frankly, people don't care For years, or names, Dates, all those details That you try hard to remember in your mind. They don't care. They care about you. Care about how you are, What you have in common. So forget about the details. Leave it aside. The Ninth Rule: This is not the last, but it is the most important. listen. I can't tell you how many VIPs have said Listening is the most, and perhaps the only most important skill That you can develop. The Buddha said, I quote, \"If your mouth is open, you are not learning.\" Calvin College said, \"No one is really listening on the way to losing a job.\" (Laughter) Why don't we listen to each other? The first reason: We prefer to talk. When I talk, it's me who takes control. I am not obligated to hear anything that does not concern me. I am the center of attention. I can reinforce my identity. But there is another reason: There is no distraction. The average person speaks 225 words per minute. But we can hear 500 words per minute. So, our minds are filled with 275 words. And I know, it takes effort and energy, To give real attention to someone, But if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You are just two people exchanging screaming sentences that are hardly connected. in the same place. (Laughter) You should listen to each other. Stephen Covey said it beautifully. He said: \"Many of us do not listen with the intention of understanding. He listens with intent to respond. \" Another final rule, number 10, is as follows: be brief. [Good conversation is like a short skirt, short enough to hold attention, And long enough to cover the topic ... sister] (Laughter) (clap) All this boils down to the same basic concept, and that is: Be interested in people. As you know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather And there was some kind of ritual in our house. People would come to talk to my grandmother or grandmother. And after they left, Amy was coming to us, And she was saying, \"Do you know who this was?\" She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. And so it arose on the assumption Everyone has something subtle and wonderful about them. Frankly, this makes me a better hostess. I try to remain as silent as possible. Keep my mind open, I am always ready for something that surprises me I have never been disappointed. Do the same Go talk to people, Listen and listen to people, Most importantly, be prepared to be surprised Thank you (clap)", "c4z6RZXv5p8": "Is interstellar travel doomed to remain in the realm of science fiction with faster than light travel and infinite improbability drives? Never mind warp speed, is light speed even possible? Technically no Light is massless and travels a little over 1 billion km/h Since spacecraft are not massless you need energy to accelerate as you keep gaining speed, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need increasingly larger amounts of fuel Eventually, even tiny gains in acceleration require huge amounts of energy Getting to exactly one hundred percent light speed would require an infinite amount of energy which is why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an impossible goal Before we look at how close we can get to the speed of light et\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consider what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accomplished so far When it comes to space travel, everything starts with a rocket still the best way we know of to literally get our feet off the ground ockets give spacecraft that initial massive boost to escape Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gravity t\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first step in getting people to the moon sending probes to the planets our sun and even the edge of our solar system pollo 10, the dress rehearsal for Apollo 11 never landed on the moon, but at reentry it did set the world record for the fastest manned spacecraft at just under 40,000 km/h in order to get all the way to the moon, it needed the help of Saturn V still the most powerful rocket ever launched The New Horizons probe, hitching a ride on the Atlas V holds the record for fastest launch velocity at over 58,536 km/h t was also the first spacecraft to reach Pluto in 2015 sending back the first detailed images ever taken of Pluto Launched in 1977, Voyager 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn and once complete to leave the solar system entirely It couldn't do it with rocket power alone so it used gravity assists at Jupiter to slingshot to Saturn and again at Saturn to fling itself out to the edge of the solar system Voyager 1 reached a top speed of 62,000 km/h but it still took over 30 years to reach interstellar space in 2012 In 1976, the Helios-2 probe set off to study the sun and the interplanetary medium To do so they were put in highly elliptical orbits with the Sun at one end and all the way out to the Earth's orbit at the other Each time it approached the Sun the massive gravitational force sped it up to a record setting speed of 253,000 km/h the fastest any spacecraft has ever travelled Solar Probe Plus will study the corona and outer atmosphere of the sun ith an expected launch in 2018 Over the course of seven years multiple gravity assists will be used at Venus to bring it into an orbit around 7 times closer to the sun than Helios With that close of an orbit it will crush the Helios record with a top speed of just under 725,000 km/h Even still, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a meager .07% the speed of light and would take over 6,000 years to travel 4 and a quarter light years to get to Proxima Centauri the closest star to our own In 2016 a planet, Proxima b, was discovered around the star It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably rocky like the Earth and in the right orbit to be potentially warm enough for liquid water on the surface if it has any This makes it an excellent target for the first interstellar spacecraft Staying in the realm of current or near future technology only can we improve on that speed? Ion propulsion is currently employed in some satellites but most notably, the Dawn spacecraft which studied the asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres Inside the thruster, electrons bombard neutrally charged atoms ausing them to lose electrons and become positively charged ions Thrust is produced as they are shot out in an ion beam The resulting thrust is miniscule but since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fuel supply can last for years, unlike a rocket that tiny amount of thrust keeps compounding on itself and in time, it can potentially reach speeds of up to 324,000 km/h, although no spacecraft currently has While not the fastest it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a practical method to study multiple celestial bodies in one mission an exciting potential for solar system exploration In the 1970s, the British Interplanetary Society conducted a study Project Daedalus for an unmanned fusion propelled interstellar spacecraft With help from the Tau Zero foundation in 2009 hey initiated Project Icarus to update the concept with the Ghost team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s design winning the internal competition in 2013 For propulsion, Ghost uses Inertial Confinement Fusion Small fuel pellets are shot into a fusion chamber Lasers bombard each pellet from all sides, compressing it then one final laser pulse shoots into the core, igniting the fusion process The resulting plasma is expelled from the ship, producing thrust The older Daedalus design would have reached a remarkable 12% light speed Ghost can only get to 2.33% light speed reaching Proxima Centauri in around 186 years While much slower,  Ghost allows for deceleration at the star for scientific study using it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own fusion engine and a magnetic sail 400 km in diameter Ghost also uses a more practically sourced fuel Deuterium and Tritium while Daedalus used the more efficient combination of Deuterium and Helium-3 Unfortunately, Helium-3 is too rare and inaccessible on Earth You would have to mine a gas giant like Jupiter or possibly the moon to get enough fuel Though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fusion process itself that may be the biggest challenge We have yet to achieve a sustained fusion reaction in the lab Until we figure that out, these ships won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the ground Weighing in at 1.4 million tonnes and over a kilometer long Ghost couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t launch from Earth it would have to be assembled in parts This is no small task as The International Space Station, the largest spacecraft ever built is 450 tonnes and 109 meters long, peanuts compared to Ghost Since almost all of the mass of a fusion spacecraft is fuel imagine not having to carry any with you Enter the solar sail IKAROS is a small solar sail spacecraft built by the Japanese space program JAXA Launched in 2010, it was the first successful demonstration of solar sail propulsion Similar to ion propulsion sunlight results in only a small amount of thrust but it keeps compounding on itself and only stops when the spacecraft is too far from the sun The total thrust is determined by the surface area of the sail versus the mass of the spacecraft With a big sail you can catch more light With less mass, the light can push you faster There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also more solar energy imparted on the spacecraft the closer you can get to the sun As long as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t burn up in the process Unfortunately this may not be good enough to get to another star within a lifetime It would take a 1 kg spacecraft with a 1km x 1km sail travelling extremely close to the sun about 100 years to reach Proxima Centauri But we may be able to improve on this Breakthrough Starshot is another proof-of concept project to design an unmanned laser propelled spacecraft. A mothership containing thousands of nanocrafts will be launched into orbit This allows for redundancy in case of failure and a variety of payload options These tiny, gram-scale nanocraft have a sail only 4 meters to a side and just a few hundred atoms thick The Light Beamer is a ground based array of lasers that combine together in a single beam to propel each nanocraft to 20% light speed within minutes At that speed, they could reach Proxima Centauri in as little as 20 years While just a flyby mission they could get close enough to Proxima b to take pictures with enough detail to see continents and oceans if it has any While the team doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any deal breakers that could stop the project that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to say there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any challenges especially building the light beamer At 100 gigawatts, the array would be 100 times more powerful than a nuclear power plant It will also need to contend with the scattering effects of the atmosphere as an orbital laser of this scale is too expensive Speaking of which, the projected cost is nearly 10 billion dollars about half of NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 budget But it does start to look like a bargain compared to the $100 billion dollar cost of the International Space Station Breakthrough Starshot may represent not only the most practical interstellar spacecraft but at 20% light speed it would be the fastest", "1RA2Zy_IZfQ": "you  I just want to say you know as somebody who also works in the fields of hypnosis and stage hypnosis I've always surprised by the way the general public sees it I would I believe that most people probably see hypnosis is really about you know turning people into chickens basically and another thing if you ask somebody who's a little bit let's say a little more paranoid that you'll find out that hypnosis is really about mind control and you talk to somebody who's a little more traditional and you'll find out that hypnosis is really about sin and something's quasi diabolical here's an example of a son Gally who is a 20th century film star who is a evil hypnotist now even among the scientific community there's been studies that show serious studies that show that there is no such thing as hypnosis that the hypnotic state does not actually exist and I think that even if you talk to let's say educated people such as yourselves that you'll find out when you boil it down that hypnosis appears to be some kind of magician's trick mind trick and that when you boil it down it's ultimately completely and totally fake now what if I said to you that if we don't understand hypnosis is it possible that we could be being hypnotized right now you basically don't know so I'm gonna make a suggestion let's call it a hypnotic suggestion i suggest you that hypnosis is entirely real in fact stage hypnosis is real and hypnotherapy is real here's an example of some of the many things that are treated with chemotherapy as well not only that but accelerated learning by hypnosis is real and the hypnotic bar as previously mentioned a bar where people are hypnotized to be completely drunk while they remain absolutely sober is also real hypno surgery where you can be operated on while completely awake is also real and of course absolutely that being turned into a chicken under hypnosis is also completely real maybe I could start off by saying there's good reason why we don't understand hypnosis and these are some of the reasons we go way back in time probably the first hypnotist were shamans aboriginal and native shamans here's an example a real example from 1914 but Shawna's generally didn't share their secrets there's one man who really put hypnosis on the map and that's this guy Anton Mesmer an Austrian doctor he was so influential that the word to be entranced to be mesmerised is from his name Mesmer Mesmer was the talk of paris and in the 1780s more than three thousand people a day would often go visit Mesmer to be healed he would do strange incantations he would appear to knock people out he would give them and hold them with magnets and thousands of people would come to see him regularly now this attracted the attention of the medical establishment of the time and they put pressure on the king of France Louis xvi who actually organized a Royal Commission to investigate Mesmer which was led by this guy Benjamin Franklin now the interesting thing about Benjamin Franklin is at that time he was the ambassador to France and also a great scientist and he and another group of scientific luminaries got together and they investigated Mesmer they concluded that there was nothing to Mesmer's claims that he was not really healing people and as a result Mesmer was treated and named a fraud and a charlatan in fact here's some popular artwork at the time that shows Mesmer being sent to the fires of obscurity by the light of Reason science and justice I would say that till this day as a result hypnosis hypnotism lives in the shadows in fact if you go to a bookstore often in North America or Canada and ask for books and hypnotism you'll usually be referred to the occult section so this is why hypnosis remains in the realm of the fake now if that's true if hypnosis is fake can I propose maybe a simple test that basically we perform right here this is a quasi scientific formula that we perform a series of very simple hypnotic inductions and maybe some hypnotic suggestions and we see what happens if if not if no if hypnosis is fake then nothing will happen if it's real then I guess we'll see is that okay  okay alright so if anybody is nervous and there always is a few people that are nervous I can suggest to you that you can avoid this process by simply ignoring my instructions for the next three minutes simply ignore my instructions and you'll be fine for the rest of you I'll just suggest you that right now you put your feet flat on the floor so focus on the center of the spiral and now I'll ask you to take a deep breath in take a deep breath in watch as the spiral moves very good and now take another deep breath in straight up towards the ceiling and now allow your eyes to just slowly blink on the count of three two one you can blink now very good and asking to blink one more time and blink now reopen your eyes and as you do as my hand drops you're gonna feel your eyes getting heavier your eyelids are going to get heavier heavier and a few seconds you'll just allow them to close three two one you can shut your eyes now beautiful as you close your eyes you get a very deep relaxed feeling and that allows you to feel like almost like your eyelids are melting into your cheeks you're so relaxed and calm and in fact your eyes are going to close tighter and tighter that they are now shut very good the more you try to open your eyes the more they will stay shut you can try to open your eyes but the more they stay shut and as few seconds I'll ask you to do a test and see if you can open your eyes but the more you try the more they are shut right now get anybody open their eyes very good now on the count of three you will be opened your eye you will be able to open your eyes if you can't let's go one two three now you can open your eyes beautiful who could not open their eyes just now who could not put up your hand if you don't mind could put up your hand okay good the people who could not open their eyes I miss gesture you come up on the stage for the next part of our experiment you could not open your eyes come on up the stairs are over there the stairs over there come on up you could not open your eyes very good people that are more hypnotizable are often more imaginative some of the greatest athletes in the world are very hypnotizable they're often strong and brilliant and beautiful as these people clearly are so now just gonna do a little bit of an experiment though if you guys don't mind so I'm just gonna ask you to stare at the light that little light at the end of the room right there very good now here's the interesting thing I didn't ask you sir just to put your hand out put your hand out and push down in my hand push down my hand harder harder harder sleep all the way in dropping down all the way relax and sleeping and ask you right back here very good I'm gonna ask you just to push your hands out like this very good don't worry don't worry feels good just push your hands up like this if you don't mind ready go take a deep breath in stare at that light you focus very good focus deeper three two one sip all the way and dropping down to sleep beautiful very good some people are not gonna react now just what your hands go down hand goes down up down and now sleep beautiful very good now this next person very good we do something this is a new induction that we developed for TEDx actually it's called a TEDx induction just stare at that spiral and ask you to put your hands up like this like an X that's right except facing the other way beautiful now stare at the light take a deep breath in and relax hands a little more straight very good as it cut me down it lets you didn't notice that your heart is beating because you're on stage all these people are looking at you look at the light and just focus on the light take a deep breath in relax them sleep all the way in very good rock them down all the way very good relax and calm now  I'll explain I'll explain in a second okay sir same thing push your hands out like this deep breath in just watch my hand go down just watch it right here go down down down down sweep all the way up drop him down all the way very good excellent shake your hand breath in and sleep all the way and drop him down all the way very good person okay right now I'm gonna say a word when you understand what that word means it's gonna happen to you you understand so just there at that spiral Sara that lights why right there and I say the word SL e t sleep beautiful very good excellent person I'm just gonna ask both you to stick your hands up like this both of you deep breath in stare at the spiral and everybody sweep all the way up very good nothing a beautiful and you can just rock down and sleep it's okay very good excellent  you're so amazing and just say sleeping's gonna happen very good dropping down excellent I'm gonna leave these people up here so you can experience are you okay for being up okay so what these people are experiencing is something that we call hypnotic sleep hypnotic sleep is actually they appear to be sleeping but I'm gonna suggest you that that is not true they are not actually sleeping here's some examples and they show some examples if not its sleep so here's some examples of hypnotic sleep and one of the reasons why we don't understand hypnotic sleep is we tend to focus on the hypnotist and not the people who are actually sleeping so now I'm gonna go a little bit closer take a look I'm gonna suggest to you that these people are in a very interesting state now do they look like they're sleeping and I'm gonna suggest to you that they are actually awake and alert if you can hear my voice and you know what's going on you have the power to lift a finger on your right hand you can do that now if you can hear my voice you can lift a finger on your right hand now beautiful take a deep breath in and relax and now go back to sleep beautiful relaxing all the way they are actually still here they haven't gone anywhere I'm going to suggest to you that right now these people are in a state that is akin to what you might call sleep paralysis sleep paralysis is a state where we feel like we are sleeping but actually every night when you go to sleep you become paralyzed by your own body so that if you dream that you are running or falling or jumping you don't actually jump out of your bed or run out of your bed so this state is right now sleep paralysis you notice that people are quite relaxed and limp okay so let's do a little bit of an experiment let's do a bit of an experiment right now and I'm going to suggest at this point that people are very open to suggestions so maybe I'll start with this fellow read here when you hear the word hypnotism person I'm touching me now when you hear the word hypnotism you will shout it's fake when you hear the word hypnotism you will shout it's fake when you hear the word hypnotism you will start laughing you will shout I am in complete control of all my actions do a bit of an experiment and I must try something else there probably people in the audience right now that are actually in trance so I can ask you to take a deep breath in anybody the audience and you can go right back to sleep beautiful anyone the audience is relaxed and sleepy so anyone in the audience who hears the word hypnotism will also shout it's fake okay very good so now coming back into the room feeling refreshed and relaxed remaining in trance on the count of three two one when I snap my fingers now when I am talking right now about hypnotism fake what I'm trying to illustrate is that something hypnotism is not it's not it's not well understood okay it's not well understood what do you think of hypnotism big if I could just ask this person for a second what do you think of it clearly clearly you do now I'm going to show you something in my right hand I have a sleep gun this is a gun it cannot hurt you but when I shoot you with this gun you're gonna go right back into a deep and relaxing sleep on the count of three two one bang sleep and bang sleep and bang sleep very good so these people are in a very relaxed state these are sort of our all-stars here now I suggest you there's something very interesting going on with these people and it's something if you want to look at it it's actually in the eyes now I don't know if you can see it clearly but you see this person right here can you see it their eyes are actually flickering now why would their eyes are flicking on to suggest something interesting that their eyes are actually rolled up in their heads now why would that happen isn't that kind of weird and I'm going to suggest you let's go back to our friend the shaman look at the shaman his eyes are also rolled up you can look at here is it a little bit closer you can see a little bit closer and now let me show you something else that sometimes when people are in this state you can see his eyes are flickering the people are in this state that they they sometimes remain with their eyes open that looks a little bit like this now look a little bit closer and of course we get an effect that looks almost diabolical in fact this is straight out of the Exorcist and it may explain this stereotype so now let me show something let's go back right here and let me suggest to you that there's probably a reason why this state actually occurs and maybe I'll start with this person right here that is it possible that the original hypnotist to use the stereotype of hypnotist somebody uses a pendulum that goes back and forth but that pendulum going back and forth is doing something particular to the eyes let's do a little bit an experiment this is a induction developed by Mike Mandel a Canadian hammer test I can ask you man if you don't mind if you can just sit up for a second I snap my fingers you can sit up now I'm just gonna ask you just to look at my finger right watch it keep your head steady and watch it go back forth back forth your eyes get heavier and a few seconds they will just close back forth now you can just go relax to sleep beautiful look at her eyes are flickering so she has entered a state and I hope that this is kind of sciency she's entered a state that is very similar to REM now is it possible that what hypnosis is doing is jump-starting the actual REM State now to show you perhaps an interesting example of why this must mat might matter let me show you a video take a look at this [Music]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music]  so I know that's a pretty ridiculous video but let me explain this actually something very profound going on here and that is there's actually a veterinarian rodent wrote an article for the newspaper that explained that what's actually going on here is that cats are actually reliving traumas they're not but here's the weird thing why are cats afraid of cucumbers because cucumbers remind them of what or look like what snakes exactly they look like snakes but hold on a second with domestic cats in North America or in Kingston anywhere like that would they ever encounter a snake no never so why would domestic cats all seemingly be programmed to already be afraid of snakes that they've never met the explanation very simply is that professor Michel Juba experimental medicine the University of Lyon the sixties did a series of experiments he's called the Christopher Columbus of dreams and his theory is that mammals are all mammals while they're in the womb basically enjoy a powerful REM state a dream state that dream state may be essential to programming us to be what we are so cats would be programmed to be afraid of snakes while in the womb that would be an explanation for why they are now afraid of cucumbers even though they never encounter snakes that make sense so now is it possible that hypnosis is us hacking in to this actual dream state and let's take a look here's a here's a here's a common experiment you probably remember the movie the matrix and the matrix neo is programmed to know kung fu it's advanced technology helps them know kung fu and I'm going to suggest to you that we can do something like that today I'll take this person right here you are a kung fu master now and you're going to demonstrate a new form of kung fu in the red dot known as TEDx a powerful dramatic form of kung fu you will always remain safe and you will not push your body beyond its known limits you are also a kung fu master you will perform an even more dramatic form known as TEDx squared you will also always remain safe and you will perform your kung fu exhibition right after the first one so I can ask this person to come back to the room in the count of three two one mice at my fingers please meet the master of Kung Fu right now sure you want demonstrating the rare and beautiful TEDx form  hi what he cook  Sara coming back to the room now you are a kung-fu master you will beat that come that incredible demonstration that you only heard you're going to perform this is the form now known as TEDx squared  thank you now I want to take us from in conclusion maybe back to the the chicken what is really truly amazing actually is that when I do hypnosis shows I used to avoid ever turning people into chickens because it's cliche and silly but then I actually learned something amazing when you do the research there's something amazing about people being chicken so I'm gonna do a demonstration deep breath and relax and sleep beautiful maybe Tara you can go read like to sleep beautiful very good you are a chicken Peck and you say macaw you do all the chickeny things you are a chicken that's right you do all the chickeny things you're a great amazing chicken you madam are a cat you are cat and you're very much like a cat now [Applause] chickens can come out you can step up here now one thing about chickens and cats  [Laughter] [Applause]  now I'll just ask you remind you as chickens and cats you have been programmed to be mortally afraid of cucumbers if you see an image if you see a picture or an image of a cucumber you will scream you will scream anyone sees a picture of a cucumber here will scream now cat do you see the chickens sure do you see the chickens  [Applause]  now I'm going to ask all of you you don't mind to direct your attention to the screen  [Applause]  sorry ok ok it's alright it's alright it's alright go back to your you can go back to your that's right you can go back I'm gonna make a suggestion now [Applause]  here's a simple demonstration of hypnotherapy now when you see a cucumber you will no longer scream you will only laugh you'll laugh incredibly hard you'll be unable to stop laughing now  [Laughter] [Applause]  [Laughter] very good you can have a seat right now so I'm gonna give you Tara I'm gonna give you the sleep gun here's a gun and what we do take this gun I want you to shoot the cat over there I want you to shoot him he won't be hurt you're gonna go into a deep relaxed state and then I'm gonna ask you to shoot yourself okay and go into a deep and relaxed state so here's a sleep gun right now you can just make a loud bang that's all shoot the cat over there if you don't mind go into a deep relaxed state and sleep beautiful very good when you shoot him he'll go into a deep relaxed state very good  okay now I know that we all laugh at the guy and has stands for the person that becomes a chicken but actually this shows a very profound and amazing aspect of humanity humans have the ability unlike other mammals apparently to dream just about anything we can imagine ourselves as chickens as aliens as any kind of weird associated thought or or feeling and that really shows why humans have such a powerful and it's a sonnet to some extent limitless imagination I'm going to suggest to you that hypnosis itself remains completely uncharted it is still misunderstood and that the state that these people are in when they come out of the state they're going to feel wonderfully refreshed and relaxed that's because with hypnosis we hack into the fundamental programming state which also happens to be a state that is itself tremendously recuperative this dreaming state is tremendously recuperative and healthy and you're going to see these people will come out of it feeling very healthy relaxed and clear so in conclusion I wish want to say hypnosis is not the preserve of hypnotist or hypnotherapist even it is the common massive and amazing inheritance of all humanity and that's something that the world needs to know so in conclusion the people that are in a hypnotic state and the people that includes the people in the audience if you're hypnotized in a few seconds you'll come back into the room you're going to feel refreshed and relaxed and wonderful you've done an amazing job you're really incredible and magical when you come back in the room you're gonna feel refreshed relax no longer hypnotized there's only one catch you'll have no idea what happened while you were on this stage you will forget everything that happened to you on this stage until you hear me say the word fake then everything will come flooding back to you you remember everything and you will laugh okay so I would just like to say in conclusion I hope today that I have demonstrated that hypnosis is totally and completely fake  thank you very much [Applause] [Music]  you  [Music]", "Lp7E973zozc": "Hello! Hi San Francisco! TEDx- Oh my God, the light is strong! Hello all! how are you? (Audience cheering) Okay ?! My God! OK... My name is Mel Robins, and for the past seventeen years, I did nothing but help people get what they wanted. without any reason! My husband is here. Well, I did this in the courtroom, in the meeting room and in the bedroom, In a living room strangers, and what room do you want me to be in, If you are there, I will help you get whatever you want, in any way. For the past three years - I have hosted a joint radio program. Five days a week, I broadcast live in 40 cities And I talk to men and women across America who feel stuck in trouble. Did you know that a third of Americans are dissatisfied with their lives today? What is equal to one hundred million people! This is crazy! I experienced that in my new program, Which is considered insane, this program is called \"relatives in marriage\". I moved in with families across America - (Laughter) I think you got the picture! - Those suffering from strained relationships with their in-laws. We do it in the same house, I verbally assassinate them all, We open Pandora's Box, Have people stop arguing about local cakes Who will host the Thanksgiving dinner, I get them to talk about real things. And this is what I want to talk about with you. I am here to help you. I will tell you everything I know in less than 18 minutes. What I know about getting what you want. So now I would like you to take a few seconds And think about what you want. You are! I just want you to think of yourself! Damn Simon and the term \"we.\" It's all about me now! (Laughter) (Applause) Sorry, Simon. what do you want? And herein lies the matter. I don't want it to look good in the eyes of others. Being healthy will not make your bottom need a walking device. Get rid of your big men boobs to be able to relate to one of them. This became a motivation. (Laughter) So, I want to know: What do you want? Do you want to lose some weight? Do you want to triple your income? Do you want to start a non-profit organization? Do you want to find the love of your life? what do you want? Get it, here. You know what it is, do not analyze it much, just choose something. This is part of the problem. You will not make a choice. So we'll talk about how you got what you wanted. Frankly, it is simple to get what you want. But note that I did not say it was easy. It's very simple. In fact, if you think about it, We are experiencing the most beautiful moments in our lives. So the ideas that we hold in our minds, whatever they are, You want to eat healthy food to treat diabetes, You want to know how to care for and care for the elderly, Creating a new disability care center, You want to move to Africa and build schools there ... guess what? You can head to a bookstore - right away! And purchase at least ten books of certified experts Turns to how you do it. You can search for it in Google. And you can find at least I don't know exactly - maybe a thousand blogs Step by step documentation, transformation steps That someone else is already following. You can find anyone on the Internet and are now chasing them! (Laughter) You can follow in their footsteps - just rely on the science of drafting. Watch what everyone is doing and follow carefully, because someone is already doing it! So why don't you have what you want? When you have the information you need, You have the relationships and connections that you need, There are probably free tools on the Internet that allow you to create a business, Or join a group or do whatever you want ?! We can express it in one word: Damn. Stop it, know what I'm talking about? This bomb is all around us! You always hear it! I really don't understand the attractiveness of this word. What I mean is that you don't look smart when you say it. In fact, do not express your true feelings. It is a cheap trick to turn to. You know, of course, that I'm talking about the word \"fine.\" \"how are you?\" \"Oh, I'm fine.\" Oh really? Are you like this? You wander around and carry your extra weight of about 20 kg, are you okay? Feel that roommate is with your wife, are you okay? You haven't had sex in the past seven months, are you okay? Oh really?! I do not think so! However, this is the deal that tells you you're okay: He's actually a genius. Because if you feel fine, you will not be forced to do anything about it. But when you think of this word \"fine\", it makes me feel very angry. We are holding a lecture about being alive Will you describe our experience of being alive as \u201cokay\u201d ?! What a weak and weak word! If you are in poor condition, say you are! If you feel in amazing shape, let us know! Tell the Truth! This does not only apply to social behavior: \"Oh, I don't want to burden you with the fact that I hate my life,\" Or \"I'm in very good condition! But I don't want to bother you.\" The most important issue-- The main issue with the term \"okay\" is that you say it to yourself. The thing you want, I guarantee you, You convince yourself that you are OK without realizing it. For this reason, do not motivate yourself. They are parts of our lives that we have surrendered to. Where i said, \"Oh, I'm fine. My mom will never change, So I can never have this conversation. \" \"I'm fine. We have to wait for the children to complete their higher studies before divorce, So we will use separate bedrooms. \" \"I'm fine. I lost my job, and I could barely afford to pay the bills, But in any case - it is difficult to get a job. One of the reasons why I feel so disturbed is this word. According to scientists \u2019calculations - Oh yeah, I got off! (Laughter) Scientists have performed a number of calculations Possibilities For your being She was born. It is true. They crushed these numbers. See you up there. They crushed the numbers centered around you - Yes, you stand there, would you like to sit down for this? They crushed numbers related to your birth. And they took into account all wars, Natural disasters, dinosaurs, And everything else. And do we realize that the odds, the odds of being, Yes, here, put the computer aside, Stand up for me, Doug! (Laughter) Chances are Doug is here, turn around and say hello to everyone. Possibilities for Doug's birth The moment he was born, For your parents, with the DNA structure you own, It's one of 400 trillion! Isn't this amazing? Doug: Take it lucky! Miles: Yes: I'm not okay. You are gorgeous! You have ideas that motivate you to change your lifestyle for a reason, and not to torture yourself. Thank you, thank you Doug. (clap) Christine was right when she said that each of you can take the stage. Because each of you - we all belong to this category. One of 400 trillion. You have ideas all day that can change your life, It can change the world, it can change the way you feel, What do you do with them? nothing! (Grunts) I hope I won't show you that. (Laughter) You did not pay for it. (Laughter) And all I want from you is to think for a minute, because all we have - I like to use the metaphor and the \"internal snooze button\". She has these amazing ideas flowing and appearing. You were watching people all day And I guarantee you, it's like ping-pong-bam-bam-bam balls And every time you get an idea, what are you missing? - Take a nap! What was your first decision this morning? I bet it was about getting back to bed. \"Yes, the first decision today, and I'm one of 400 billion, I will go back to sleep. \" I understand! Your bed is comfortable! It's soft, it's warm! If you\u2019re lucky, a person next to you may be next to you, Or in my case, I have my husband, two children and maybe a dog. And the reason behind this first decision I made today, The alarm button to take a nap, returns to it In which area of \u200b\u200byour life would you like to change, Anyone - There is one truth you need to know. that is the true: You will never feel like doing this. Start. Nobody is coming, there is no motive, You will never feel like doing this Scientists call it activation and activation energy. This is what they call the required force Modular change in everything you do Adopting the autopilot to do something new. So do this test tomorrow. You think you are beautiful, I know, you are in TED. (Laughter) Try this. Tomorrow morning, set the alarm hour 30 minutes before your waking up. And when the alarm rings, take your sheet and cover, Throw it away, stop and start your day. No nap, no delay, Not that you say \"I will wait here for five seconds because Mile is not here.\" - Do it. The reason I want you to do this is because you will be face to face With physical, I mean physical strength Required to change your behavior. Do you think someone needs to lose weight May he feel he needs a diet? Of course not! Do you think they would like to eat boiled chicken and peas Instead of eating a croissant? I do not think so! It is the activation energy Required to keep your back from the computer chair and head to the front door, To go for a walk that you said you would take, It is the same amount of force that you need To force yourself to leave the warm bed and enter a cold room. Interesting in being an adult Is when you are eighteen, Nobody tells you that your task will now be to take care of yourself and raise it. With the term \"raising yourself\" I mean, your job is to get yourself to make trivia that you don't want to do, In order for you to become everything you want and what you are supposed to be. You are very busy waiting to be what you want. And never will be! My son doesn't want to stop playing his electronic game. So this is my job! Stop using this damned electronic game! Kendall, clean up Barbie dolls! Arrange them If you are going to organize a nudity party in the bathroom, clean the place at least! (Laughter) My God, chew food and your mouth is closed! We are not in the fold, to shout out loud! Okay, dinner is approaching, move away from the pantry. Cooley, as a kid, Your parents force you to do something that you don't want to do. Because you never want to. Not now, not after a while, and never! Even when you do a good thing, You'll find that there is something else new that you don't want to do. Then you will get upset and bored and bored, \"I hate this job, bored.\" But will you look for a new one? No! You will be fooled about that thing. It's very simple, getting what you want is simple. But it is not easy. You must push yourself to do so. I mean power. And the reason I stand for the term \"strength\" - When Rose took the stage and talked about chasing passion, And she had a picture of the brain lobes - I look at the brain in the same way. I describe a side of your brain as an autopilot The second as an emergency brake. These are your two speeds: autopilot and emergency brakes. And guess what part your brain prefers: autopilot. You have experience when it comes to driving to your business and when you get there She asked, \"Oh my God, I don't remember driving here.\" (Laughter) You are not drunk! This is what your brain looks like in autopilot mode. It only works at this level. The problem is in your mind that at any time Do anything different from your regular routine, Guess what your brain is doing - it uses emergency brakes! This reaction is used with anything. Anything! Go towards the kitchen and see Everyone would have left breakfast dishes to be washed. And repeat for the hundredth time, \"I will kill them all. Actually I'm going to leave her here and get them to do it. \" But this is not your daily routine, is it? So choose your mind: emergency brakes! It returns directly to the autopilot. \"I will do it and feel disturbed and therefore we will not have sex. That's what I'm going to do. \"(Laughter) (Applause) So when you say \"strength\", Anything you do to take a break from your daily routine will require strength. And if you think about your life, It's kind of funny because we are kids and then we become adults, And we spend a lot of time trying to push our lives forward, Toward a kind of stable routine, And then we grow up with a feeling bored of it! You wake up at the same time every day, you eat almost the same breakfast You drive towards your work on the same road, you get to work and look busy, Avoid making calls, making updates to Facebook, You attend a meeting and you mess around all the time, Go back and write Facebook updates, make an outline of the evening, You look more busy, go the same way to go home, You generally have the same dinner or a variety of it, You see the same media scenes, Then you head to your bed and repeat the same thing every time! No wonder you are bored and lose your mind! Routine kills and eliminates you. I have a theory about why people feel stuck in their lives. Most of you have undergone basic psychology lessons, And you exposed to Abraham Maslow's \"hierarchy of needs\"? Well, your body looks great. Because you have these basic needs. Your body looks like a radio transmitter. If you need food, how do you feel? If you need to drink water, how do you feel? If you need sex, how do you feel? And I think when you feel stuck or unhappy with your life, I think it is a signal. It is not a sign that your life is destroyed. Signal to let you know that one of your most basic needs is not provided. Your need to explore. Everything about your life, and about your body, is growing! Your body cells, hair and nails regenerate, Everything grows all your life. Your soul needs to be explored and to grow. The only way you'll be able to achieve this is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable. Force yourself out of the ordinary, To cross the border, thank you. If you keep your thoughts, you are behind enemy lines. This is not talked, okay? It is not such! In fact, if you put on speakers and we broadcast what you say to yourself, We'd like to give you my corporate personality. (Laughter) You will not want to go out with people talking to you In the same way that you speak to yourself. So go beyond your limits! Your feelings! Your feelings destroy you! I don't care how you feel! What I care about is what you want! And if you listen to your feelings, When it comes to what you want - you won't get it. Because you never feel that you want it. You must go beyond your comfort zone. It's not about facing risks, Rather, it is about leaving the comfort zone. These are the first three seconds when you force yourself to leave the bed a bit like. But as soon as you leave it feels great. It's like the first three minutes when you're sitting here in this runway, Someone turns to you, saying, \"Get up and come dance.\" And you think about saying, \"Oh, I have to do it,\" And then it retracts. That experience when you had the motivation to do so Hence the activation energy was not used Required to force and motivate yourself, The emergency brake pulls out - \"I'm sitting here. I'm not going up there with these crazy people, I don't like to dance. \" What happened with me was that I went up here, crashed into Brachel, Then we started talking and after a while she wrote a tweet on Twitter. And we are friends and suddenly! Get out. There is where the magic lies. Here there is one of 400 trillion. So all I do - oh, well, this is the last part. Sorry. There is another thing that you can use, called a five-second rule. Your mind can analyze facial expressions in 33 milliliters. He can move very quickly. Another thing that he does quickly That if there is a motivation that motivates you and motivates you, If you don\u2019t take any action within five seconds, It pulls the emergency brake and kills the idea. kill her! If you have the drive to get up and dance while the band is playing, If you are not leaving your place within five seconds, It will pull the emergency brake. If you have a motive for this, Today you will find inspiration in someone\u2019s conversation, And when you don't have the initiative to take action in five seconds, Write a note, send a text message to yourself. To do anything to get him to come together with this idea, You will pull the emergency brake and kill the idea. It does not enable your problem with the idea, but your problem is that you do nothing practical. She kills her. This is not my fault. This is not anyone's fault. Do this to yourself. Stop it! I count on you. One of 400 trillion. There are things that you have to do. It will not happen like this in your mind. So today I want you to practice this. When we go to a party, and thank God that it will be soon, Because I think we can drink, I want you to practice on the five-second rule. You see someone and you think you have a motive, Does it sound interesting? Head there! I got inspiration from someone and you have a request! Ask for it. This is why you are here! Try it out, and I think you will be shocked by what's going on. And one more thing after, I want you to know that everything I do, Whether it is a radio or television program Or a book I wrote or a column in a newspaper, All of this is for you! And if there is anything I can do, If I could do anything to get you to do the things you don't want, So you can get what you want, I'm gonna do it. But you need to take the first step, you need to open your mouth, And you need to ask for it. Did you get that? this is good. Do it. (clap) Thank you, thank you, yes! Please stand up! You got the motivation to do that, stand up! thank you!", "EzZGPCyrpSU": "the future of humanity is in the stars if we wanted it badly enough interstellar travel could be achievable in our lifetime so what would it take to build a starship why don't we see evidence of galactic empires is our galaxy littered with the remains of single planet civilizations as Elon Musk has asked is it really so difficult to colonize other star systems recently there's been some pretty wild talk of some crazy ideas for space travel technologies we have the non momentum conserving emdrive the wormhole from interstellar and the Alcubierre warp drive that last one is extra cool and yeah we'll get to it but let me be clear humanity's first adventure to the stars won't and shouldn't wait for far-off fantastical technologies our first starship will use technologies achievable in our lifetimes I'm being optimistic but not unrealistic now building this starship is going to take a huge amount of political cooperation money and single-minded focus hell this thing's so big we're gonna have to assemble it in space so for argument's sake let's say humanity's future is at stake and we just discovered Earth 2.0 in the Alpha Centauri system it's only four point four light-years away but we have to get there before the kerbals and the impending k1 asteroid that's on its way so we have to focus on one design our best chance what do we build the key is finding the right balance between the speed of the starship and the amount of time it would take us to develop the tech to build it no point launching a slow ship in 20 years if the ship we launch in 50 years overtakes it this balance is factored into something we call the weight calculation and we want to get this right first option one traditional rocket fuel this is a non-starter but just to give you an idea the fastest manned vehicle ever was the Apollo 10 rocket which reached a speed of nearly 25,000 miles per hour which would get you to alpha cen in nearly 120,000 years propellant is the big limiting challenge with space travel conservation of momentum sucks to learn more there's some very serious rocket sites in this episode about farts the rocket equation tells us that maximum speed is based on exhaust velocity fuel mass and spacecraft mass if you want to get to alpha cen in a human lifetime you need to get to 10% the speed of light and to do that with a liquid rocket fuel you need a fuel tank larger than the observable universe not too efficient there are two ways to achieve high velocities propel a lot of mass backwards or propel less mass at much higher speeds so yeah let's do the second one we just want the fuel with maximum energy density so direct conversion of rest mass into energy seems like the way to go remember e equals mc-squared the Sun does this pretty well so let's build an engine that works like a mini star I'm talking option to fusion in fact want to choose the most metal option and just explode nukes behind our starship and surf the blasts this was a real option contended for the Orion project by Freeman Dyson and others in the late 50s and 60s we're going to assume modern thermonuclear devices and launch with roughly three-quarters of our starships mass being taken up by 300,000 one Megaton hydrogen bombs blast them behind us one by one over about a month and we accelerated 1g to around 10% of the speed of light nice we get to our percent in 44 years assuming we don't need to slow down at the other end actually slowing down is a huge issue we need to use half of our fuel to slow down at the other end which unfortunately means we half our speed so let's make that 90 years for a one-way trip this means we need three generations of humans on board that ship and pray that space babies turn out okay still this tech is perhaps the most achievable in the shortest time we already know how to build bombs yay cold war although the 1963 test ban treaty says no space nukes maybe we can make an exception for the future of humanity there are also some pretty awesome options for running thermonuclear reactions on board fusion rockets either pulse blasts like the Daedalus project or ongoing fusion you could push to a bit higher than point one see this way but probably not a lot higher it's an awesome option and may actually happen but the tech for contained fusion is only now emerging and there are many difficult challenges it's rocket science and nuclear physics so you know hard but fusion turns less than 1% of rest mass into energy what if we could get close to a hundred percent well that's the idea behind option 3 antimatter drives when madame meets is antimatter counterpart both particles are annihilated liberating most of the rest mass as energy this is an extremely efficient fuel for example it would only take around 10 grams of antimatter to fly us to Mars in a month the big obstacle here is that harvesting and storing antimatter is incredibly difficult we can make it in particle accelerators but it's slow and hellishly expensive we've only been able to do this with small numbers of anti protons at a time not the kilograms we'd need to get to the Stars assuming we can scale up production of anti protons by a factor of say 100 trillion trillion then Payan rockets may be a possibility annihilate a proton and antiproton and you get charged pylons moving at near light speed channeled with magnetic fields these pylons provide our thrust at something like 50 times more energy per kilogram of fuel than the best fusion options low fuel weight means our max speed is limited only by how much antimatter we can make 0.5 C is plausible meaning a trip to a percent  eight C which would be nice because then time dilation really kicks in our even travel time down to three point three years from the astronauts perspective okay Rockets are cool and all but what if we didn't have to carry any propellant at all what if we could sail to the stars on a wind made of light the light sail I'm talking about a kilometer wide sapphire coated sail riding the beam of a gigantic space laser blasting the power equivalent of a hundred nuclear plants what the hell let's do that okay most of the interstellar thinking for light sales has been about unmanned probes 10% life speed is pretty reasonable with modern materials like a carbon web sail driven by a microwave beam running on a single nuclear power plant this is an update to Robert forward star wisp spacecraft but it should be scalable if we want to take actual humans we're going to need a bigger boat which means a proper visible light laser and a larger sail coated with advanced reflective and heat-resistant materials like sapphire this laser is going to have to be ridiculously large possibly built on the moon and powered by massive helium-3 reactors or in orbit around the Sun powered by vast solar panels how fast is this thing go because we aren't carrying any fuel maximum speed is only limited by the power and collimation of our laser and the size of our sail the longer the effective range of the beam the higher the speed we can reach 10% light speed or higher should be doable these tech issues need to be factored into the weight calculation and besides these slowing down at the other end is a major problem there are possibilities for braking in the stellar wind of our destination star although that is tricky ultimately though the scalability of the light sail means that speeds even greater than point 1c are possible okay most awesome option for last the black hole drive in fact a swathes chilled kugelblitz this is an engine powered by an artificial black hole and is one of the fastest options for subluminal travel this is a black hole made not from mass but from light a sufficient energy density of laser light focused in a small enough region would bend the fabric of space-time enough to produce a singularity the kugelblitz German for ball lightning a black hole of the right size radiates Hawking radiation like crazy the smaller the black hole the more radiation and this radiation could drive our starship the sweet spot is a black hole of around 600 billion kilograms or to Empire State building's which will be roughly the size of a single proton such a black hole would radiate nearly 160 petawatts which is roughly the equivalent of 10,000 times the world power action and it would evaporate in around three and a half years any smaller and it evaporates too quickly larger and it radiates to weekly and becomes too massive to feasibly accelerate the ship and the black hole assuming we who catch most of the radiation this amount of power accelerates us to point one C in twenty days and presumably to a significant fraction of the speed of light in the lifespan of the black hole there's no question that it ultimately goes faster than the other options it's also clearly the coolest of all of the subluminal engines I mean even the Romulans user the only drawback is that the lasers creating the black hole we need to be vastly more powerful than even the black hole they created this is a possible yet very distant technology okay so lots of ways to get to the stars what's the fastest honestly if we had to colonize in the absolute shortest possible time then its nukes like the Orion project we have the tech we just have to increase the world's nuclear arsenal by a factor of 200 which we shouldn't do unless it's a question of extinction still in a super optimistic estimate we could have boots on the ground in 2120 or so now fusion engines are more sustainable even if the tech is a minimum of 50 years away they land us on alpha cen in the latter half of the 2100 s assuming we start now pure antimatter and the kugel it arrives there the starships of the far future assuming warp drivers don't pan out these are what we'll want to actually explore the galaxy with near light speeds dilating apparent travel time down to human scales let's talk near-term reality I'm going to come out and say it light sails we'll put our first unmanned probes in the alpha cen system it'll take around 45 years from launch not slowing down at the other end and another four and a half years to get the message that we succeeded maybe we could launch a star wisp in less than 30 years and some kids watching this video might see this to fruition manned light jammers are away off but totally plausible humanity's first attempts to land in other worlds might well have a sailing to the Stars it's likely between this and pulsed fusion Drive either way pretty epic which option you most excited about let us know in the comments we hit warp 7 next time on space time last week we talked about why the speed of light is really the speed of causality you guys had lots of amazing questions and Draper pony and others asked why does the speed of light have to be that specific number 300,000 kilometers per second and what would happen to the universe if it were different well that actual number 300,000 kilometers per second just comes from a pretty arbitrary definition of the length of kilometers and seconds now physicists often choose to define the speed of light as C equals 1 which we call natural units at that point if perhaps becomes more interesting to ask why other fundamental constants of nature have the values that they do compared to the speed of light now that said the relative units of the fundamental constants the speed of light the strength of the fundamental forces etc are important for the properties of this universe and you change them too much in the universe as we know it doesn't exist we'll talk about that more in another episode jaycara and others ask what about quantum entanglement shouldn't we be able to transmit messages instantly this way right spooky action at a distance as Einstein called e on the surface does seem to mess with us when you collapse the wave function of one entangled particle your choice of measurement affects the state of its entangled partner instantaneously potentially over large distances however it turns out that this can't ever be used to transmit new information faster than the speed of light so causality is preserved we may do an episode on this but in the meantime veritasium has an excellent one linked in the description ed Stefan asks why we're even talking about gravitational waves where none have ever been observed when we get back to this next week but in the meantime in pointing out the indirect detection of gravitational waves Gareth Dean delivers the amazing quotes so we haven't seen a duck but something's been quacking and eating all of our breadsticks the kernel asks does this now mean I can refer to the speed of light as total monkey speed the answer is yes enter Tyler Hamilton all I have to say is y'all Oh", "Bntj6OCe2_g": "From the possible site of the legendary Garden of Eden to

The island is home to several species of plants that are can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found anywhere else on Earth. There are the Dr. Seuss looking Adenium socotranum which have big bulbous trunks and tiny gnarly branches that sprout from their tops and bear flowers that are a marvelous shade of pink. There odd appearance makes them kind of look like giant root vegetables. Then there are the Dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blood Trees which look like perfect natural umbrellas. The have trunks that resemble that of an average tree but their thick tightly bunched branches shoot upwards and form a mushroom like crown. Socotra is also home to three geographically unique species of bird: the socotra sunbird, socotra grosbeak and socotra starling. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many other creatures that inhabit the island other than that of bats and insects and the last time it was home to man was around the year 100 A.D. Adding to the mystery, the island has been the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the years. Number 8. \"Palmyra Atoll\" Though technically not an island but an atoll that formed from coral the mysterious nature of Palmyra Atoll cannot be ignored. Also known as Palmyra Island, the breathtakingly beautiful ringlet sits between American Samoa and Hawaii. Though it is full of lush vegetation and appears unblemished by man the island has long be the subject of superstition and folktales. There have been several cases of violent shipwrecks and mysterious disappearances of ships on and around the island. Those who have observed the island and survived to tell their tale have claimed having seen some extremely bizarre sights like that of floating lights, ghosts and sea monsters. It is also reported to be the home of an incredible amount of sharks who may have developed a distinct taste for humans. There is also the story of lost Incan treasure that may still be on the island. These tales and others which cannot be discussed do to their graphic nature have made Palmyra the stuff of legend amongst sailors and Pacific Islanders for centuries. Number 7. \"Vulcan Island\" Vulcan Island in the Philippines isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily an island that is shrouded in mystery but it definitely is a mindblowing locale. On the northern Philippine island of Luzon there sits a lake named Taal and in that lake there is an island called Taal Volcano, inside this island is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest crater lake and inside of this lake there sits yet another island, known as Vulcan Island. Not only is Vulcan Island one of the most fascinating of natural recursion it happens to be located on one of the most active volcanoes in the entire Pacific Ocean. Because of this fact it is incredibly dangerous to visit Vulcan Island as it has been quaking and bubbling since 1991. Number 6. \"Easter Island\" The world renowned Easter Island still attracts tourists, anthropologists and archaeologists to this day who are both perplexed and in awe of the statues left behind by the ancestors of the native Rapa Nui peoples. Though the mysteries behind these statues, called Moai are now mostly solved, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only puzzle that is confounded visitors to the small island off of Chile. Scientists recently answered one of the biggest questions surrounding the Moai which was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow did the Rapa Nui move these massive stone idols?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 They found out that these statues were specifically designed to have pot bellies so that they could be rocked back and forth until they were eventually wiggled to where they wanted them. But the mystery that still remains unsolved doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do with the Moai but rather the people that built them. The Rapa Nui have been found to have a completely separate genetic heritage to that of nearby native South American peoples. In fact their closest genetic relatives actually came from Pacific Islanders that live near Southeast Asia. So what is the mystery? Well despite being located in the Pacific, Easter Island is still thousands of miles away from the Rapa Nui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearest relatives. So how did they get there? And how did they build such advanced structures and invent their own agricultural system at such an early period in history despite being geographically isolated from civilizations with similar advancements? Number 5. \"The Island of The Dolls\"-The Mexico City borough of Xochimilco is steeped in Mexican history. Because it has long been the hub that connects the various canals and lakes of Mexico it has been the cultural melting pot of the country. One particular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfloating garden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the canals of Xochimilco may be eerie to outsiders but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s origins come from a caring place, in line with Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tradition of honoring those who have passed from this life to the next. The legend goes like this, one day a man found the body of a young girl who had met with a tragic fate in the waters of one of the canals. When he later returned to the spot he found her he spotted a doll floating in the water and believed it to have belonged to the girl. In order to pay tribute to the girl he tied the doll to a nearby tree. As the days passed he still felt like the girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at rest so he started to bring more dolls and hang them on the trees. Though no one knows if this story is more than myth, it has become a tradition to hang dolls on the trees of the floating garden which is now known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLa Isla de las Munecas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Island of the Dolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Although this tradition comes from the heart, it is still quite a frightening sight as the dolls are in various states of decay and some have even told tales of them coming to life. Number 4. \"Poveglia Island\"-Just off the coast of Venice, Italy lies Poveglia Island which may have one of the most twisted and horrifying histories of any island on Earth. During the devastating Bubonic Plague outbreak of the 14th century the government of Venice decided to try and quarantine the infected by sending them to Poveglia Island where they would live out the rest of their days. Because of this, even after the plague subsided the site became basically a national lazaretto and used anytime an outbreak of disease occurred. Poveglia would being to serve a new purpose in the 1920s when a mental hospital was built on it and the terrors that the patients were subject to at the hands of their caretakers only added to the haunting history of the island. The island has since fallen into dangerous level of disrepair and the Italian tourism bureau technically has forbidden people from visiting unless they go through an extensive application and interview process. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped ghosthunters and thrill-seekers alike from finding alternative ways to sneak onto the spooky island. Number 3. \"Isla Bermeja\" From the 1500s up until the late 1900s there existed an island off the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, at least according to maps there was. The islet of Bermeja was long used as the geographical boundary for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section of the Gulf but several mapping expeditions in the 20th century that went looking for the island frankly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. There are several theories as to how an island could appear on maps for the better part of four hundred years but then suddenly disappear. Most modern day experts believe that the island never existed at all and may have been the result of a cartographic mistake that went uncorrected. Some say that the island, which was described as being the color of strawberry blonde hair, did exist but sank into the ocean. This theory is backed up by British maps dating back to the 1840s which describe the island being slowly swallowed by the sea. However, there are those who believe that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance and the fact that it had political significance are not mere coincidence. Because the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most oil-rich regions on Earth some have theorized that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence was only perpetuated by the Mexican government in order to strategically extend their claim. On the flipside, there are also conspiracy theorists who believe the island did exist but was destroyed by the United States government for the same reason. Other conspiracies claim that the island still exists but that the evidence has been wiped from maps due to it being the site of top-secret activities. Number 2. \"Floating Eye Island\" While surveying the Parana Delta of northern Argentina in 2016 with the hopes of finding the perfect setting for his upcoming film, Argentinian filmmaker Sergio Neuspillerm found one of the most peculiar places in the world. Deep in the misty marshlands Sergio came upon a lake that appeared to be shaped like a perfect circle. Not only that, but there was an island in the lake that was exactly the same shape and it filled up the majority of the lake, leaving only a thin ring of water around it. Sergio was fascinated with the island that would come to be called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and quickly returned with a small research party. His team reported some strange findings. They found that the island was actually floating in the water and appeared to rotate around the lake on its own axis. They also say that the water was astonishingly cold and clear and the bottom of the lake was significantly harder than the rest of the ground in the area. Because of these mysterious observations Sergio decided to scrap the initial film project he was working on in favor of shooting a documentary on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Since the word got out on Floating Eye Island several conspiracy theories with it at the center have arisen. The most popular of these is that the island is covering a secret alien base. Number 1. \"Diego Garcia\" In the middle of the Indian Ocean is Diego Garcia Island which has been shrouded in conspiracy. The island, which is part of the Chagos Archipelago, was uninhabited when it was settled by French colonists in 1793 who brought hundreds of slaves to the islands to work their plantations. The island would eventually fall under British control as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. After slavery was abolished, the freed slaves (who had established their own cultural identity) stayed at the island and continued to till the land. But the Chagossians, as they had come to be called, were forced out of their home in 1971, in order to make way for a United States Naval Base. The US and UK had come to an agreement allowing the US Navy to take control of the island, but the base that the Navy wanted to build required the Chagossians to be unwillingly relocated. The arguably unethical methods the United States used to get the islanders to comply, such as slowly cutting off their supplies or euthanizing their pets would only add depth to the conspiracy theories that would subsequently arise about the island.", "_ruRiTeX1jE": "well ladies and gentlemen good afternoon to you what an absolute pleasure to be here quick question who here owns a Ferrari seriously not a single one a couple of weeks ago I saw something that you don't see every single day it was an accident between a Ferrari and a VW Golf by the time that I arrived the VW Golf was on one side of the road and it was a little shorter than it was meant to be originally and on the other side of the road was this what used to be a six foot three gleaming red Ferrari but was now a four foot two slightly more crunchy Ferrari and you drive past that and you think to yourself that's a really bad day for some wealthy individual and it's not something you see every day so I pulled my car over I put a little fit a comment on Facebook and I said let's have a moment of silence for the mighty fallen never again to go from nought to a hundred in six point three or three point six seconds and the reaction that I got from some of my friends on Facebook was interesting people said they didn't say things like what a shame what a pity our what a loss they said serves him right and the hatred just kept on coming one comment after another how can he drive a car like that in a country like this our roads are wrong for it he was probably drunk one person stopped just short of accusing him of being a child molester and it was fascinating to me just to see the level of hatred aimed at this Ferrari driver now here's the interesting bit about it the only information that I put on Facebook was there has been an accident between a golf and a Ferrari that's it we don't know who was wrong we don't know if it was the golf driver who made the mistake we don't know if a dog didn't run across the road and caused this thing but what was interesting is it showed up a belief system that most of us don't even know we have it's a bias against the rich it's fascinating now in a room like this we are all studying and working toward building careers building futures becoming high net-worth individuals let me ask you a question do you reckon you can become a high net worth individual at the same time as hating wealthy people it's a self-limiting belief and it actually gets in the way but what's fascinating is that the kind of thinking that is handed down to us from generation to generation is invisible it was once beautiful wasn't it and I'm not the only person who's actually seen this in motion anybody here watch Top Gear yes yeah absolutely Top Gear fans join me for a moment here the rest of you can just go to sleep Jeremy Clarkson says in the United States you watch a person drive by in a Bentley and the reaction is one day I'll be in one of those and he says it's different in Britain he says in Britain you watch a guy drive past in the Bentley and you say one day I'll have him out of that that's a bit more sinister isn't it a little bit darker and it's really interesting because particularly in South Africa we have spent decades trying to unravel a belief system about racism that's been handed down from generation to generation but we are not aware of other beliefs that are handed down to us particularly beliefs about wealthy people and here we all are chasing these goals and chasing these lives while at the same time feeling uncomfortable about talking about money or talking about wealthy people as though they are obviously evil they come from the devil let's take a look at how this thinking is created how its generated how its handed down from generation to generation and how it can stop you from achieving your goals the point is to unravel it get it out of our minds X I sit be rid of it be free of it so that we can actually chase the goals that we have in life and become all God intended us to be in my family if you go back two generations to my grandmother she used to work at an English manor house in Manchester is anyone here ever watched the show on TV quite a quite amateur show called Downton Abbey anyone seen it no okay the basic idea is you've got two sets of people you've got the higher class folks who own this Abbey they're kind of semi royalty in the in the United Kingdom then you've got the people downstairs who run everything they do the cooking they do the sweeping the cleaning it's the the staff my grandmother was part of the manor house but she was not the people upstairs she was the people downstairs she was one of the maid servants who helped to keep this manor house clean and if you have to see pictures of the way that they dressed at the time it was the full old-style regalia she had the little apron and the little maids outfit and the little feather duster and it's everything we think of a slightly kinky today but of course at the time it was nothing like that this was a woman who worked incredibly hard from dusk till dawn this was a woman whose back was sawed more often than not this was a woman who if you ever met her and put your hands on her hands you'd find nothing but calluses and most importantly this was a woman who had no voice in the face of authority because the thinking back then for both the lower classes and for women was keep quiet don't make waves be a cog in the system we don't want to know that you exist we just want to see that your job gets done and this is the kind of thinking that is then handed down from generation to generation and what's interesting is that when my dad came along my grandmother was looking for the best advice she could possibly give to him about work and wealth and how to make your way in the world she went rummaging around in her mind and she came up with this Jim and it was the advice she gave to my dad she said my son get a trade that way you will never starve to death who here has heard some variation of that advice yeah yeah a lot of us have heard things down those lines there's nothing wrong with getting a trade you can become a plumber and you can become very wealthy as a plumber but listen to the second half of that sentence did she say so that you can become all god intends you to be is it so that you can let your light shine so that you can become wealthy so that you can achieve goals no it's so that you never starve to death the thinking comes from a place of desperation and that's the thinking that's handed down generation to generation and the weird part is it's completely invisible to us we hear this advice and we think it's right and we think it's normal now I'm not picking on my grandmother she was doing the best she could with the ideas that she had without perhaps knowing how much damage it can do to future generations take a look at the building you see behind me there that is an Industrial Revolution era factory it's about a hundred maybe 120 years ago what other building that we have today looks very similar to that factory out loud what do you think  hospitals what else schools schools yeah schools and here's an interesting one r-run according to the Industrial Revolution age of thinking picture this for a second you drop your kids off at school or you as a child or dropped off at school and you line up in neat lines and the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle or rings the bell and in your neat lines you go to your workstation and you sit down you sit down at your little workstation and you work for a number of hours and then the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle rings the bell and you take out your little lunch box and you can have some food then the whistle goes again you go back into your work station you sit down it is run according to an industrial revolution era Factory why because we are training human beings to be cogs in a system and we're still doing it hey now I'm not picking on schools here the point is not to say that schools are badly run the point is just to say we have thinking that is invisible to us we are trained to thought and we are culture alized to act in certain ways that no longer make sense in the modern economy the old world thinking says become a cog in a system fit in don't make waves and if you're a perfect cog you'll get you a little bit of money at the end of the day and you can go home that thinking will keep you poor so what are some of the alternatives well that's what I'd like to look at with you here today I like to call that style of thinking the wheelbarrow way it basically goes like this it's like the parents get hold of their child the young son the young daughter they say my son my daughter you are young and strong you must go out into the world and earn coins here's how you do it pick up your wheelbarrow load it full of bricks and for every hour that you push your wheelbarrow you will get one coin if you want a second coin you have to push your wheelbarrow for a second hour now we think like that we go the only way to earn coins is to work for a set number of hours so let me go and get a job and be dead on a boss now you work your set number of hours every day you push your wheelbarrow for your set number of hours and a horrible thing starts to happen you start to realize that you can't quite afford the car you're not quite breaking even with the kids and their education and the debit orders and the bonds and so on so what do you do you go back to the thinking that was handed down to you and you say if I'm not getting enough coins what do I have to do I have to push a second wheelbarrow in the evenings to get more coins that kind of thinking keeps families in generational cycles of poverty if you take nothing else away from today this is the one principle that is the most important do not tie your earning to the number of hours you work you've got to separate those two and I'll show you how today but so long as we think a number of hours equals a number of coins we are in financial trouble because as a human being you only have so many hours in the day the wealthy person's epiphany the way of breaking out of this idea is this dump the bricks in your wheelbarrow get rid of them load your wheelbarrow up with gold in other words for every hour that you push that wheelbarrow you need to raise the value of your work earn more coins per hour not work more hours in order to get more coins so that make sense okay of course that raises some interesting questions are how the heck do you do that there are definitely ways of doing it what are some of the things that our families teach us about work and about wealth and about how economies work and once again it's not to say that they are trying to do damage in our lives they are doing the best they can with the thinking handed down to them but the world has changed what are some of the things that they teach us work hard there's nothing wrong with working hard I believe in working hard but the goal is actually to make money not to work hard and there is a very big difference there in certain companies people think you are fantastic if you are working hard not necessarily if you are being effective so what they do is people make a show of the number of hours that they work how they work over weekend how they part of every meeting they're not necessarily getting stuff done but they're showing that they're working hard yeah that's the difference the next thing is play it safe play it safe wealthy people take risks all the time the middle classes and poor folks take no risks at all in fact I heard a phrase the other day that's just been resonating in my mind that says the middle classes are paralyzed by doubt they are secure to the point of paralysis they do not take risks and of course the thinking handed down there is get a safe job and let someone else take care of you be like everyone else here's an obvious thing that has to be said if you be like everyone else you're gonna earn like everyone else if you choose the safe route in life you are choosing to earn less than you potentially could so today let's talk about the idea of recession versus abundance you've probably heard I mean it's all over the world news and it's in every newspaper every blog everywhere you go the recession that we've been talking about that kicked in in 2008 what's interesting about recessions is not what's going on in the world what's going on in your Innerspace up here there are for example speakers in my industry who have decided that there is a recession and have earned a heck of a lot less as a result then there are other speakers was a gibe particular guy in the states named randy gage who said in 2008 the world issued an invitation to go into recession and I politely declined and he says he's had his best year ever every single year since then because what happens is when we are told that there is a recession we stop acting in ways that generate money because we believe that people aren't buying we haven't discovered a recession we have bought into the concept of a recession there are certain companies who have had their best years ever since right the way through this recession because they simply don't believe in it today I'd like to share with you a tip eight ideas eight ways of overhauling your thinking that have to do with work and wealth and my promise to you is that they are going to be uncomfortable I hear to make people feel good but this stuff is massively important it's important because we are still being taught the ways to work that are outdated the world changes but we're still practicing the old ways if you do do the Twitter thing you're more than welcome to tweet about it as you go along I see a couple of people grabbing their phones when you see the eight yeah if you want to connect with me on Twitter use at Douglas Kruger yeah you can say this guy is talking a load of rubbish or this is a valuable idea whatever but I warn you I'm going to close the doors and check every tweet before I let you out I will find you epiphany number one resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy there's a phrase that my family always used to use and when I was young we struggled really really badly with poverty we had some incredibly rough winters one that I remember we went through the whole of July with our power cut off we had our local church bringing food baskets to our house and I lived in a pretty decent neighborhood and we were the odd ones out so it's quite rough to go through that sort of thing and to have someone else feeding your family when your own parents can't it was a difficult time to go through but what's most interesting to me now looking back on that time period is the kind of language that my family used around the dinner table has your family ever used a phrase like how the other half live when they talk about rich people yeah you know what it's like it's like rich people are a different species the way that I'd like you to look at the difference between where you are and wealth is I want you to look at it as a curve because if it is a curve you can move along that curve you can go from where you are now to your goals but if you buy into that thinking that says rich people are just a different species then instead of a curve there's just a chasm there's a hole there is an absolute void between where you are and where you to be and if you don't believe that it's possible to move along that transition you don't act in ways that start to move you there the first the starting point in becoming a high net worth individual is the belief that it is possible that a wealthy person is not a different species they're just further along on a continuum they have more education about what brings in money and how to achieve goals than what you currently have and that's okay because that represents hope that means you can learn these things you can do them resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy we often think about wealthy people as they're obviously evil they're obviously corrupt they obviously stepped on people's faces to get where they are now Forbes magazine paints a different picture of that they take the highest-earning individuals on the planet and they look at how much they give the stats bear out that wealthy people give more per capita than anyone else we're not just talking about more money because they actually have more we're talking about more per individual in percentage form the idea that wealth people are wealthy people are obviously stingy obviously evil is not borne out by statistics yeah of course there's obviously the odd jerk you will meet the odd horrible rich person they're out there certainly in their numbers but by and large it is not a valid rule that's number one number two there are three things that money is not money is not the root of all evil that's not what the verse says what does the verse say the love of money and it also doesn't say is the root of all evil it says something down the lines of is the root of many kinds of evil now think about what that belief would do to Christian families people of faith if it becomes a locked-in belief and it's handed down generation to generation money is the root of all evil okay so if I chase it there's something wrong with me you can't hold that belief and become wealthy the two do not work together and that's one of those things that we need to check out it's a misquote of the original verse and it's damaging it does a lot of harm particularly to people of faith money is the first thing money is not the root of all evil the second thing money is not embarrassing could you be rich with a straight face time to face that question because you are on a career trajectory that can potentially make you very wealthy could you handle it what kind of human being would you be once you get there yeah wealth simply makes you an amplified version of yourself so what are you if you're a horrible person a rich version of you is going to be a horrible person who's able to do more if you're a good person who likes to help others a rich version of you will be an amplified version of that their money is not embarrassing and if we are embarrassed by money it changes a number of things around the dinner table as a family we won't talk about it no no the middle classes like to talk about how hard we're working but we never talked about how to earn money or how to lose money all of the rules of money you get into the home of wealthy people and that's what they talk to their children about because they think it's important money is not embarrassing we must talk about it and number three you'll see that little pool on the screen their money is not finite it is not finite it is not a limited resource if I take some over here there's less for you money doesn't work that way I have a friend who studied to be a doctor she actually qualified no in fact forgive me I got that one wrong she is a qualified lawyer passed her bar exam and what she then did because she was married to a guy who is quite wealthy she said I'm not going to practice law because if I practice law I get a salary and that means slightly less money for other people folks the thinking is wrong she has the world's best intentions there but what she's actually doing is failing to contribute a little bit to the total amount of money available work doesn't take money out of a system it adds it to it the more people we have running their own businesses the more people we have selling the more people we have doing stuff the more there is for all bring your skill to this country bring your talent earn money for yourself the more you have the more there is in totality it's also very interesting because in different countries they think about the finite nature of money in different ways Korea about 10 20 years ago they decided that they wanted to do economic upliftment for the majority of their people so what did they do they took a look at America and they said I reckon we contact we can take on their car industry and we can take on their IT industry have you ever heard of Samsung yeah have you ever heard of any of the Korean car brands yeah Hyundai and what's the other one Kia and they are absolutely conquering the world right now because what they've decided to do is to grow now other countries around the world and in fact South Africa is a prime example we go oh there's a finite amount of money so if we want to make some people rich what are we going to do if we're going to take from others rather than growing the entire pool bring your skill grow the country we need entrepreneurs we often talk about how much we need jobs you can't falsely create a job my next question to you is why the heck would you want a job you can't get wealthy in a job but that's what we're taught as middle-class people we're taught be like everyone else get a good safe job ok we'll talk about that one in just a moment as well number three represent yourself represent yourself there's a fantastic book and when I'm king of the world I'm going to make it mandatory reading for everyone it's called outliers by Malcolm Gladwell anyone here read that yeah I highly recommended Malcolm Gladwell outliers he talks about the difference between people who fail and succeed in anything and he talks about how in wealthy families they teach their children something very different to what is taught in middle class and poorer families and it's just how to interact with Authority the middle classes and poorer people are taught to fear Authority and it's industrial revolution thinking you've got to fear the guy who runs the factory because he owns your life yeah and it goes like this let's take a practical example they do this one in the book he says you're taking your child to the dentist the middle-class family will teach the child that the dentist is God he has studied for eight years and he knows everything there is to know you as the child must shut up sit down keep quiet and even if it hurts don't cry just wait for it to be over do whatever he tells you to do now in wealthy families they approach the exact same situation completely differently driving to the dentist's office they tell the child the dentist is your friend he has studied for eight years so that he can serve you properly how's that Hey the dentist is a resource that you can use if you have any questions about your mouth about your teeth about anything that you want to know there you must ask the dentist because it's his job to help you now take that kind of thinking that's a simple example going to the dentist take that kind of thinking and amplify it over the next 20 years which of those two kids is going to do well in life you've got one who's taught to fear Authority shut up keep your voice down don't make waves and the other one who's taught the world is there for you to utilize it's all resources you can use it to your own ends imagine the difference that that would make represent yourself and we need to teach our children to represent themselves as well we have been conned into an industrial revolution myth that says authorities in charge and knows best you must shut up and do what you're told you must be a cog in a system and as long as you are doing your job perfectly and not making waves you'll be fine that thinking is a hundred years outdated we cannot teach it any longer number three number four inspired ideas this is one of my favorites as you go about building your career there are the things that you need to do on a day to day basis that slowly gradually move you up that curve toward wealth and if you keep doing them slowly and consistently and gradually every single day ultimately your life is going to improve and you must do those things however from time to time we get that one inspired idea that crazy thought that thing that pops into our heads are we go what if and it's those ideas which in one go can add an extra zero to your income you must have them you must act on them I'll give you a simple practical example in 2006 I had a book published on public speaking and it went through a traditional publisher in Cape Town it went into the bookstores and sold for about a hundred and fifty R and a book of which I got a trans 75 that's how much the author actually gets still I was really chuffed to have this book published and it's a bit of credibility for me as a speaker and it did bring in some money now one of my professional speaker friends said Doug don't do it that way the next time you write a book publish it yourself you pay for the printing you pay for everything and sure it's a bit of money up front but after that you can sell the book at a complete profit and I had this inspired idea I thought wait a minute what if you took that one step further what if you got somebody else to pay for the book so I literally walked in the front door of one of my biggest clients old mutual fair Bain Capital and I spoke to one of the directors and I said how do you feel about giving me a hundred and fifty thousand Rand two minutes later after he'd said yes we were discussing his next yachting holiday I took the chance I tried and it worked he paid for a thousand copies of two separate books and I've been selling them ever since no money down every book that I sell is pure profit margin hey you're starting to see how like thinking differently means different levels of income you can get a salary at the end of the month or you can do things for yourself and generate your own income with inspired ideas now that's just a small one but that brought in firstly it meant I didn't have to pay a hundred and fifty thousand rand and then beyond that it meant something like three four four five hundred thousand rands worth of book sales over the years and that's just one small thing that made a massive impact on my life but I had to represent myself I had to have the idea I had to walk through the door and just have the gumption to try to ask to not be a cog in a system that just does its function perfectly to be a human being with a face and a voice and thoughts creative ideas and an opinion and that can change the scale of your income that's number four number five number five is an abstract idea leaving the ranks of the poor may mean leaving the ranks of the poor that makes sense get will in a moment a while ago I was driving past a particularly poor area it was one of these places where on the side of the road you see these dogs with the sort of ribs sticking out and I mean it's all dust and poverty and hardship and you know I look at that sort of thing in it it saddens me that human beings still have to live under conditions like that here you think about it as a species we're at the level where we're each of us I mean how many people around the room are holding personal computers in their own hands in the form of an own or an iPad or whatever the case might be we have that kind of technology we send satellites out into space we are able to take a photograph of Earth from millions of miles away and then send it back through the void and look at that picture we have astonishing levels of achievement and yet we still have families who don't have enough to eat every day that's awful now dry I happen to be on my way to a conference where I was speaking about an entrepreneurial idea how to make money and I thought to myself just a mental exercise if I was stripped of all of the stuff that I use every day the suit the car the equipment the bits and pieces there the toys if I was stripped of all of that and just left with my knowledge my wits and my education and put into this scenario living in abject poverty could I get back out could I get back out and back to my own life what do you think and could you yeah okay most of the people around this room are kind of saying yes now that's an interesting thought let's take that thought one step further if I had to take a high net worth individual someone who does Drive the Ferrari the Lamborghini someone with their own private helicopter with their own business whatever the case might be and I transplanted them into your life do you think they would be able to get back out if we say yes to that then what we're saying is the gap between where you are and where that person is is up here and then a horrifying thought but at the same time it represents hope because it means it can be done it means that the thought is out there the ideas are out there the knowledge the education is available it can be done leaving the ranks of the poor however may mean leaving the ranks of the poor my thought process went like this I thought maybe I'd start up a small company something that doesn't doesn't require a lot of startup capital maybe a little store maybe I'd get other people to work for me and then I kind of stopped enough so I thought to myself that's not what I do the first thing I do is to physically leave and go somewhere else why because often in situations like that the thinking is depressed and it's not it's not to point fingers or to point blame I mean I've been in a family that has gone through extreme poverty but when you've had generations of poverty it's almost impossible to believe it's possible the thinking becomes depressed there's a speaker in the States these days who has an interesting concept and I believe it he says you are likely to be about as wealthy and about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you think about that for a second who are your closest five it's likely to be probably something like mom dad best friend boss teacher something down those lines chances are it's those people how wealthy are they I'm sorry to ask the question but apparently those stats bear out because what happens is we get involved in an ecosystem of thinking and we all affect one another with our level of aspiration a level of ideas our thinking about work and wealth and we all Everage each other out there's something you can do about this one you don't have to dump your mom okay you don't have to dump the best friend anything down those lines what it is saying is we do need to associate with highly successful individuals we need to expose ourselves to that kind of thinking unless we do we are not going to lift ourselves up but the thinking is out there and quite often people are quite willing to be mentors friends to share answers share ideas sometimes they're not it's always worth asking worth the approach you are likely to be about as wealthy or about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you here's an uncomfortable question is your state's thinking keeping you put can you think of one policy just one then we have in this country that tries to help people but actually promotes poverty anyone social grants yeah think about it this way around what a great idea you've got a young mom who falls pregnant has a couple of kids she's on her own she has no way of earning an income so what we do we give us some money brilliant idea except then of course the opposite happens you have a young woman who goes you know what I'd like some money some money so I'm going to become a young mom in order to get it there is that likely to help them to become incredibly prosperous no is your state's thinking keeping you poor number six your positioning determines your pay scale it is not the quality of your work that determines your income you can be the best in the world at a certain thing and be out earned by someone who is not the best in the world your positioning determines your pay scale let's put this in very simple terms if you're the celebrity of your industry you're going to out-earn the non celebrity of your industry even if that guy's better at it than you let's take for example anyone here watch the cooking show with Nigella Lawson seen her on TV yeah yeah absolutely Nigella Lawson do you reckon she is one of the top five chefs in the world no I don't think so do you think she's in the top hundred mmm I don't think so do you reckon she's in the top thousand I don't think so so why is she out earning all of them because she's Nigella Lawson I'll give you another example if an unknown speaker comes and stands in front of you that person can put in an invoice fourth X number of zeros at the end of an hour of speaking Richard Branson walks into the room and chats with you for five minutes they will add three more zeros to his fee it's not because he worked harder and it's not because he's a better speaker it's because he's Richard Branson you need to be the icon the expert the celebrity the big name in your industry now here's where most people get it wrong they say knowledge is everything knowledge is important but you also have to bring personality that's what Nigella Lawson is doing she is able to speak well in front of a camera she's pretty she's seductive yeah now this is all the stuff that we are never taught as important we are taught what's important is be a cog in a system don't make waves function perfectly get your job done imagine if Nigella Lawson did that she'd be poor all she'd ever do is cook in the kitchen maybe earn like five bucks once in a while yeah but because she brings humanity to it she brings to it things that cannot be done by a computer that cannot be done by a system anything that can be systematized computerised commoditized is unvalued all we're still teaching our kids to study IT that's a low income future because there's like two billion other people studying IT and most of it will be done by the computer itself like tomorrow that's how fast it's moving there's at one of those talks on Ted the inspirational talks website where a guy says and this is quite interesting he says the economy of tomorrow will not be ruled by people who have doctorates or who have studied IT or anything technical the economy of tomorrow will be ruled by people who did bas and know how to think creatively because the computer can't do that it's the people who bring their personality their humanity you become an icon in their industry so it's not just about how good you are technically at what you do it's about being the human being to face the voice the one we see in the media in magazines hear on the radio are you an icon that way you earn more number seven this one's more for companies but it's useful to us as well don't fixate on the bottom line what most companies tend to do is when they think about their finances they put 80 percent of their energy into saving what they have and 20 percent of their energy into earning more we need to reverse that saving of course is important yes you can save yourself rich if you've got like 150 years to live what's more important is actually generating more income picture a clan of people now I want you to just use your imaginations here let's go back thousands of years in time we're sitting at the outskirts of our cave we are a plan and we're facing winter winter is like recession winter is trying winter is deadly to us and our economy is made up of Buffalo we eat them to survive we wear their coats in order to survive this horrific winter the hunters have been out into the field and good news they came back with three Buffalo but three Buffalo is not quite enough for our entire clan to make it through the winter we technically need more now the thinking in the clan splits in two we get the hunters and we get the bean-counter in the cave and the bean-counter says what we have to do is take those three Buffalo and conserve them preserve them make them last save them so that we get through the winter the hunters see it differently they say no no give us one of the Buffalo to eat and using that strength we will go back out into the field and we will get more Buffalo so that we can make it through the winter all big organizations have this split between the bean-counter and the Buffalo and sometimes it destroys entire companies yeah my belief system says this it doesn't matter how well you save your Buffalo if you don't have enough Buffalo saving effectively is only going to mean you'll starve to death slower you need more Buffalo in the system in other words you need to put 20 percent of your energy into saving your money and 80 percent of your energy into generating more money that's the way we need to think saving is important but it's not all important middle-class thinking says the most important thing to do is save sure if you're going to live for 150 years brilliant idea number eight Randy gage the u.s. speaker recently wrote a book called risky is the new safe the alternative applies safe is the new risky we've been taught for generations to play it safe you get a job and don't make waves I contend that that is the most dangerous thing that you can possibly do because you are taking all of your eggs and putting them in one basket you are taking your life your future your career your spouse your children your medical aids your debit orders your entire life putting them into one basket and handing them to a person whose first concern is not your welfare that sounds pretty dangerous to me also 6070 years ago people did go and get a job and work for 4050 years and retire safely does that happen anymore heck no it's just not the reality most companies these days if you've got a job you have 31 days of safety that's it now let's look at this differently people say being an entrepreneur is risky being your own boss is risky well Forbes magazine says the only people who are wealthy are their own bosses okay the next thing is if you as an entrepreneur try 10 big crazy inspired ideas and eight of them fail you've got two of them working now you go out there and you try another ten big crazy inspired ideas and again eight of them fail two of them work now you're up to four things that are bringing in income you go out there ten big things eight fail two more you're up to six different things that are bringing in income for myself as a speaker I now have multiple income streams I speak I train I sell books I sell DVDs I do media appearances multiple streams of income much much safer risky is the new safe safe is the new risky and the more we buy into the old Industrial Revolution era idea that having a boss take care of us is safe the greater the danger we put our own lives in risky is the new safe safe is the new risky I believe that risk aversion is one of the things that paralyzes most of the people in the middle class your average high net worth individual has been bankrupt three times how scary is the idea of going bankrupt to you yeah to them it's a matter of course they've tried big crazy things they've tried building up businesses and they've uh Turley utterly failed but to them it's only part of the process and they do something interesting and I'd like to invite you to do this they give themselves permission to fail folks today at this early stage in your career make that commitment to yourself do yourself a favor give yourself permission to fail it's okay it's only a bit of embarrassment so any bit of skin off the knees it's only picking yourself up and trying again they think differently in California to what we think here the guy here started and started up a business and failed banks won't touch him with a bargepole in California the banks and the financier seek out the people who have tried and failed before because they reckon that person has learnt valuable lessons along the way give yourself permission to fail here's a revolutionary thought give other people permission to laugh at you and mock you for trying let that be okay say I know my family's not going to understand I know my friends are going to laugh at me they're going to tell me this is crazy you should play it safe and get a job give them permission to think that way give them permission to laugh at you give yourself permission to try and fail you need the space you need the leeway be kind to yourself my final parting thought for today is just this you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you are separated from your goals by a number of actions and that's completely different years years are an abstract concept that's like saying 1020 years from now I'll be wealthy it's not up to years it's up to you and your actions that puts the ball back in your hand that gives you control that gives you the power you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you're separated from your goals by a number of actions the word is as a man thinks so is he so ladies and gentlemen know to think for may god bless you and may you prosper", "ARWBdfWpDyc": "Translator: Mhmad K. Shamma Auditor: Riyad Almubarak Have you ever experienced this experience? You talk to someone They tell you about a topic they care about most Or know a lot about him, And you follow with them. Then, at some point, you realize that you are no longer aware of what they are saying. Standing there Realizing that you have no idea what they are talking about. (Laughter) I have just gone through this with a friend who knows a lot about investing. Which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know much about, Of course, it is important, very important information But he started talking about some kind of diversified investment portfolio - And many others (Laughter) Unfortunately, I went without any useful information. So, I think this position is familiar to all of us, Fortunately there are several things you can do to improve this situation, Which is what I will talk about today. Well, I am a scientist. I work in the field of quantum physics. Thus, you are on the two sides of this type of communication. I was the one explaining complicated things to someone, You are also the receiving party For many intense scholarly discussions with my colleagues. When this kind of disruption occurs in communication, I noticed something very interesting, And he, as the one who lost understanding, You feel kind of guilty about this. And you, if you think carefully, you will find that this feeling is completely wrong, It is not your fault that you will find at that moment, There is absolutely nothing you can do to better understand. But there is something that the other person can do to help you understand. By finding a better way to explain what he's talking about. Based on this - During my science experience, I found that the only way to escape similar situations is to have courage To stop the person explaining in a polite manner, And say, \"Sorry, I don\\'t understand what you are saying,\" Then try to go back and start where I lost my comprehension. This requires a bit of courage This is because you somewhat acknowledge your ignorance of the topic at hand. But I think it's okay with that and in fact, my fears were totally unjustified. In general, people respect you if you are interested in Knowing the correct information Or interested in understanding it correctly. So, I think we shouldn't feel bad about not knowing something Not even about asking questions. So I do a lot of scientific communication, And science really does have this communication problem Because in general its subject matter is very complicated. You know, scientists are always complaining How their research is being distorted by the media, For example, \"Drinking wine cures cancer.\" (Laughter) By the way, this is not true at all. On the other hand, you can understand How journalists may be overly simplifying or misrepresenting things Because, to explain recent research, You need a doctorate in advance for the subject, This is what we cannot expect from journalists In various scientific disciplines. So, I think the world will be better off with many people Who really know scientific communication, People understand science and can explain it in a way The general public was able to absorb it. This is important for several reasons, You may realize a specific reason It is that all scientific research is conducted around the world Funded from public funds. So, it would be good if the general public could understand The work that their money was spent on. But for me, there is an additional important reason to improve scientific communication So it is fun. The research being done is very amazing and it would be great if people could benefit from it. For example my field of study, Quantum Physics. Very fun specialty, But he has a reputation for being extremely difficult. And it's true, things get complicated when you look at the details, But this does not mean that it is something that can not be talked about at all. Well, let's do a hand count. Whoever does not know what quantum physics raises his hand. Don't feel bad about not knowing it. Raise your hand and don't be shy about your ignorance. No problem in that. Well Well. Quantum physics is the description of the smallest things in the universe. So if you look at what's smaller than cells, Down to the level of molecules, atoms and constituent parts of an atom, Subatomic particles are protons, neutrons, and electrons. It describes how they work together and interact with light. And what's interesting about quantum physics Is that they form the fundamental rules of the universe, Nevertheless, what happens in it is very strange. So, I'm going to tell you about some phenomena of quantum physics. You may have heard about one of them being the two-wave particle. You can imagine all the subatomic particles, These protons, neutrons, and electrons are as if they were little hop balls, You jump around and bounce off each other. Sometimes you have to treat them as if they were faraway waves. Sometimes they do both, which is hard to imagine. Let me simplify it for you. Imagine dropping one of these bouncy balls into a pool of water. The ball will disappear, Then the waves appear on the surface of the water. Now imagine that one of these waves hit a stick. The rest of the waves will all disappear, Next to that stick suddenly, the bouncy ball appears again. This seems strange to think about, right? But it's the behavior that happens All the time in the subatomic particle field. Another phenomenon that you may have heard about is the quantum tunnel. Imagine throwing one of these bouncy balls into a window. So it'll go like a bounce - oh sorry - It will be, throw, bounce, pick up- Throw, bounce, pick up- Throw- Then I completely crossed through the window. She didn't crash. She did not interact with her at all. It suddenly became on the other side of the window And you can see it flying away. (Laughter) If we see this, we'll think of it as crazy, right? But this is what always happens in the field of subatomic particles. In fact, this is the only reason we are. You may know that the sun, It generates energy through nuclear radiation. Nuclear radiation occurs by combining two atoms of hydrogen The bortons collide in their nuclei. Without the quantum tunnel, These protons collided with nothing. However, what actually happens is that it merges with the phenomenon of quantum tunneling. This allows them to radiate and emit sunlight, And had it not been for the sun, we would not be there. So we can thank the quantum tunnel for our existence. Another phenomenon called superposition. It is a very luxurious word, But all that means is the ability of one thing to do two opposite things at once. For example, I can spin in this direction, And I can spin in the opposite direction, But imagine if I could Spin both ways together? (Laughter) We cannot do it, or imagine it, But that's what subatomic particles are based all the time. And in fact, we can do this somewhat at least parts of us that can. Like entering an MRI machine, What this device does is find all the hydrogen atoms in your body And it made it revolve around itself in both directions together And this overlay. It is what allows us to see inside people's bodies, So, interestingly enough, this physics looks somewhat abstract And far from our daily life. Despite this, it happens all the time, we are made of quantitative materials. This is happening all around us. Not only are MRI machines using quantum physics techniques. There are a lot of techniques that I found As a result of our understanding of quantum physics. One is our understanding of silicon That allowed us to invent silicon chips, Which exist in all computers in the world. Thus, the entire world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computing infrastructure is present As a result of our understanding of quantum physics. It is also found in other things, such as lasers - which are very useful - And nuclear power plants. There is this rumor that you may have heard about quantum physics: No one can really understand quantum physics. Well, of course, that's wrong. We understand quantum physics well, And you will hope that we do As constituting magnetic resonance imaging technology and atomic power plants. What they mean by this saying That is when we try to visualize something in our mind It can be both partial and wave at the same time, Or something that can spin in two different directions together, We find this difficult to imagine in our minds. But we can describe this well using mathematics. It is surprising that on the one hand something can be logical, But it is very practical and useful on the other hand. I really enjoy explaining science to people. I make YouTube videos and write books for children Between the ages of seven and eleven years old, And I love so much that I stimulate myself not to lock science in myself, I like to explain the most difficult things for children of those ages. Such as quantum physics, nanotechnology, relativity theory, and rocket science, Those types. I reached the bottom line You can fluently explain anything to anyone, You always walk the right way. And I came up with a set of principles that I followed to do that. I will share it with you. These are my four principles for successful science communication. I said I am aware, but it is valid for any practical communication. OK. number one: Go from the right place. We all have different knowledge. We all have a different culture. Our job is to explain the information. In a way that they really understand. It is not good to leave that gap and start knowing it Because they will not be able to keep up with the hadith. It is a good idea to formulate the information as they understand. How do we do this? It is simply to ask them what they know about the topic, Or until you start explaining and then you ask them, \"Do you understand this?\", Or \"Does this make a difference?\" And if you talk to an audience, You have to guess correctly, And the style of raising hands can also be useful. It is always a good idea to skip caution. People usually don't care to hear information they already know. OK. The second principle: Don't go too far with the topic. People usually take a certain amount of information every time, And we must be realistic about that. So you better explain three things The person will be able to understand and remember them Moreover, you will be infused with a large amount of information Because that negates all good work that you started with. So I can keep talking about quantum physics. But I hope I've given you enough examples to interest you. And you can go on while you realize it. OK. Number three: Clarity overwhelms precision. So when we explain things with examples, The temptation is to give them the most accurate and scientific explanation, But they tend to lengthen the explanation and complicate it further. It is better to start with a simple explanation It is possible that it is not functional properly, But consider it as the starting point. Imagine they are here and the full explanation is here. All you have to do is show them the way. For example, when I was talking about rotation in quantum systems, The truth is, that subject is a little bit complicated, I mean the rotation of those partial particles, But what I told you was a full picture, And if you stay interested, You can search for details later. OK. number four: Explain what you think is fun. (Laughter) If you are interested in explaining something to someone, There is definitely a reason to explain this. Either it is super important or it is super fun. And as far as you can transfer to that person, The more they tend to remember it and make it valuable to them You can do this in a variety of ways. One of them, to show your passion for this topic. Another way of showing, lies in its examples, explaining how this topic relates to our life. For example, quantum physics: every time you turn your phone on, You remember the fundamental laws of the universe for you to showcase - (Laughter) And tweet a picture of your cat. (Laughter) Those are my four principles. I would like to limp on the blink. When I meet people for the first time. And introduce myself and say I am a physicist, I get a different reaction from ordinary people, Like, \"Oh, physics. I didn\\'t understand physics at school.\" (Laughter) He spoke again, what a shame. Knowledge is not to be good with it or not. It has to be what you're interested in. If you find science awful or previously found like this, I just bother you: There is so much information you missed these days. Just choose the topic you like, Look for some references. From there, your curiosity is right. Thank you.

the scams ridiculous ideally for the scammer the only people who are going to reply are the most gullible people and me I said I'm in  then he told me to email Liberty law firm at law firm code at UK which is amazing email address they should send me your phone number so I gave him the phone number of Goldman Sachs the bank I  wanted him to think I was rich everybody should have done that because the next theme I got said J's reach I'm not sure you are real at all  you gave me phone numbers of Bank which I call and they say that you are not real they don't know you they even advised me who hi  I'm an army intelligence set of things I didn't know what to say I said look there was never a shred of doubt in my mind that I was dealing with men intelligence how can I prove to you that I'm real I mean how can you prove that you're real in truth how can any of us play over here PS what are you sending me I forgot I said the contents of the consignment is a thousand karats of rough diamonds worth 7.5 million dollars you and I will use it for investment in Europe I said that's amazing what are we going to invest them I'm not much of a stock market player myself but I've got a strong hunch Thomas is gonna be there  kind of a picture the consignment will guys yes I can boom  [Applause] enigma right then he said send me your ID passport driver's license or any any of your valid ID  [Applause] it was valid at the time then he said you were need to set up an account with our bank and pay the fee this is quite common like there he has multiple email addresses he pretends like it's another company and I thought about I thought okay I'll do that and I thought I'd throw something into the mix just to see what he did with it so I said look I'll set up a new account with your bank there's an offer of a free toaster on at the moment and I've got my heart set on it he said don't worry about getting a toast  I'll be the gist of that and then he told me to contact this Bank now the bank is masquerading as Royal Bank of Scotland right but what I love is their email address is info at Royal BS which i think is perfect and then he said don't delay I don't have much days here on earth I said what do you even know  [Applause] I have not seen anybody that is more unserious as you are even if I die soon do you have to mock me with it I said I had no idea we were talking about your dad he said what were you thinking I was talking about am I going to Mass  I said where's man who is that with the toaster  he said sorry I mean Mars one of the nine planets of the solar system  I just think if he doesn't know it's gonna be a shock I figured I'm done with this guy I'm gonna send an email to Royal BS right so I sent him an email I said look dear Royal Bank of Scotland I'm writing to you about some bling leftenant commanders have even me and a free toaster you're giving me for opening the account they go back to me very quickly they say please send us the federal account opening for and there is no free toaster raja ramesh head of customer care  I thought these guys are good via customer care are you sure be like that I was getting a free gift for opening the account sort of costumes do you do he said there is no Bonanza going on and that that this frame is an odd choice of women I think right what must have happened is he must have looked had the work competition in his language I found a synonym which was bonanza Bissell struck me as odd and then he said and even if there was conditions would apply I'll be honest that pissed me off because you cannot tell me the conditions apply to a competition that I literally just made up so what I did is I opened up Photoshop and I took a day and I sent them something I made and send them something so this is what I said I said then how do you explain this and this is a this voice  free toaster regaining you account so stubborn and then check it out guys no conditions apply [Applause]  let's go get out of that and he did he said that do not include rob Bank of Scotland worldwide I said what are my options I could do with it you cat said we will appreciate it if you do not but not this gift me again because you are  I said just be clear you're saying if I bring it up again I won't get it if I don't believe I will are you just saying I won't go at all  please stop talking of a free toaster aah  I thought of almost done it right before miss I'm always good part of me just once really wants to kind of annoy them almost as much as they annoy us and I don't about you but to me that sounds like a broken man do do this at home do do this at home I mean don't use your own email address it's of a fake email address but do you this Oh home because not only do you have a chance to to stop them doing actual damage but it's also a chance to to have fun to play that being said I thought I'd back off a bit I said of course I shan't rap again you have my word  so what we want from you is to

Well there is, this is how, you take your lemon and you roll it and then you want to take a sort of pin and just poke in the bottom in the lemon, the exact bottom where the point is here, and then you squeeze and all the lemon juice you want just pours out. Now the great thing is you made a very small little hole in it now so oxygen can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get into it and make it rot so it will stay fresher for longer. Make Butter Spreadable Sometimes you want to spread some butter but when you take it out of the fridge the butter is super hard and really hard to spread. This is super annoying, so what do you do? Usually you just pop it in the microwave but the issue with this is it always seems to over melt the butter and make it into a big soupy mess just like this. That can be very annoying so there must be a better way. Well there is, take a cheese grater and then you just grate your butter stick. Yes that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, grate your butter stick. Now that has two added benefits, one it delivers energy to the butter by the grating motion which makes it a bit softer, and also the higher surface area makes it softer quicker also. Lastly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in this funny interesting spaghetti like consistency which now is super spreadable so you can just spread it on whatever you want and you have nice soft butter. Success! Easy Potato Peeling You just take a knife and a potato and you put them together and just twirl the potato around while you cut into the skin just softly in a circular motion, then you take it and you cook it like you normally would. Now by cooking the skin with the potato you actually infuse the potato with more flavor because most of the flavor of the potato is actually in the skin so you get more potatoy mash. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cooked it, you can just pull the skin off just like this and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much more efficient, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste any potato and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much quicker than peeling it. Peeling Hardboiled Eggs Take a hardboiled egg, place it in a jar, add a little bit of water to cover then you just place your hand over the jar and shake it like mad. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done which is pretty soon, you just take out and the shell is basically fall off the boiled egg and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that easy to remove. Alright, trick number five staying on the same shaking idea this is a garlic bowl and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to place it in a jar and again shake like mad. Okay, once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done that for a little bit then you just pop it out and you just remove some of the husks because they will get in the way. Once you have removed the husks just put all these garlic cloves back inside, alright. Put the lid back on and again shake like crazy, keep shaking, just carry on shaking. And now you just pop it out and all the skins have separated from the cloves. You can just pick them away and put them to one side then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got these beautiful little garlic cloves and if any of the skin is still on you can put them in the jar and shake again or just easily pull it off very easily like that. Make Bread Fresh Again! I hate when you have old bread and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super hard and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it anymore. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I always keep my bread inside a plastic bag so it stays soft, just like this one here and then you can still resuscitate here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got soft bread but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very, very old and to resuscitate it all you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to need is just some water. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put this here so I can pour some water over it, basically just pour the water over it and pour it on the bottom also and then you want to place it into an oven at 180-degrees Celsius, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 356-degrees Fahrenheit. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to leave it in there for about three minutes and after three minutes have passed then you just want to turn it around and then hit it up for another three minutes. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still soft or not done enough just leave it a bit longer. But once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done you just pull it out and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crispy again and crunchy just like it was from the bakers and the inside is nice and soft and tender and steamy, just delicious fresh bread and this is like an old bread, this is like a week old really. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super usable again and just great to use, so give this a try at home and let me know what you think. Crazy Way to Open Wine For this trick let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assume you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find your bottle opener but you do happen to find your blow torch. Well just take it and turn it on then aim it at the little air gap in between the cork and the wine and what will happen is it will heat up the air and make it expand pushing the cork out the top in a nice little explosive bang \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just like this. Success! Alright now you turn your blow torch off and pour out your wine like you usually would and enjoy it. There we go, done! The Black Egg Alright so this next trick is called the Black Egg and for this you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just going to crack and egg into a bowl and then separate out the yolk. The simplest way to do this is just with a spoon, you scoop it out like this and just pop it in the other bowl. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to add some black cuttlefish ink but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the savory fishy taste this has you can always just use black food coloring and just mix it together like this. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mixed it together then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to fry it. Here I am going to put some oil on a pan and here I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pop it in. One thing that happens is when you beat egg whites they become a bit more runny so they will spread out more than you want. If that happens just simply push the sides in like this just to keep in an egg sort of shape. Alright now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to add your egg yolk back in, so just add it on like this and put it into position where you want it to be. Once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done cooking there you go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 simple, done. Just cook it like you would a normal sunny side up fried egg. This is just a very simple way to make something mundane look very, very different and interesting. I hope you enjoy it! Testing Eggs for Freshness Sometimes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some eggs and you just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fresh or not. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of impossible to look at an egg and know if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh even though most grocery stores these days do print the date on them just like so, but sometimes these get rubbed off because of some other reason that we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Now in that kind of case what do you do to figure out if an egg is fresh or not? Well here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a simple trick, just drop your egg in some water and the fresh ones will sink to the bottom just like this and the un-fresh ones will float to the top just like so. Now the great thing about this trick is you can do it with multiple eggs if you happen to have a big enough tub and then you can easily detect which eggs are fresh and which eggs are no good. For example here, these two are no good I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to dispose of them and cook with the rest. Super Poached Eggs Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to show you an amazing new way to make poached eggs even better. Start off by taking an egg and separating it like this, now you want to take some basil and just finely chop it up, so cut it like this and chop it up like that. Now you can use any other herb you like but the combination of what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m showing you is pretty good. Take your basil and add it to your egg whites, just like this and then add a little bit of mozzarella cheese, but you can add any other cheese you like or any other ingredients for that matter. You can put little bits of mushroom or little bacon bits, whatever you like with eggs. Once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mixed up take another bowl, take some cling film dent it into the bowl then spray it with oil so you can un-stick it later. Place half your mixture into the bowl like this. Now place your egg yolk and cover it up with the rest of the mixture just like so. Okay now to close it up, you just bring up the sides and you can tie this into a knot or use a little piece of string and tie a knot around it, or you can use one of these simple cheap little clamps and just clamp it shut. You can get this everywhere, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no point mentioning it. Now to cook it, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to place it in some simmering water for five minutes to get a nice runny egg yolk, but you can cook it a little bit longer if you want to have a more hard egg yolk. Okay so once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done just take it out, and then you just un-clamp it and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to place it here on some bread and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delicious like this but you can also add it in say an Eggs Benedict recipe or some salad, or just anywhere you want to use a poached egg. This is just way better and more tasty. END", "P_6vDLq64gE": "Translator: Arber Selmani Reviewer: Amantia Gjikondi Ok, for starters I don't want any of you here in the hall to start panicking but here's the idea that the person on your right is just a liar. (Laughter) Also, he is a liar on your left. Even the one sitting in your chair has such an epithet. We are all liars. What I'm going to do today is to tell you why recent studies make us all liars how to become a liar and why you might want to seek the truth even more passing from a liar's catch to a single seeker of truth and finally create what is called faith. And to talk about faith, since I wrote the book \"Liespotting,\" no one wants to meet me in person, no no no no no no. They say \"No problem, send it by email.\" (Laughter) I can't even drink a cup of coffee at Starbuck. My husband says \"Hey honey, any trick? Perhaps it would have been better to focus on cooking. How do you think about cooking French food? \" So before I get started, what will I do is that I will make my intent clear that is not about learning any game. Cheaters are not just spoiled kids, that at the bottom of the room shout \"Gotcha, Gotcha\" Your eyebrow rises immediately. You're touched where you shouldn't. I watch that TV show \"Lie to me\" or \"I know you\\'re lying\". No, the rogues are armed with a great scientific knowledge on how to best deceive They use deception to quickly get to the truth and do exactly what the world leaders do every day; they have difficult conversations with difficult people often even in difficult times. And so they embark on this journey accepting an important proposal which is: Lie is an act of cooperation. Think little, no lies at all, whatever the way of speech and speech. Her \"power\" landed only when someone else agrees to believe the lie. I know I can sound like a tough love, but, if ever you were the lying side happened because you agreed to be like that. The first rule about lying: Lie is a cooperative act. Now, not all lies are harmful. Sometimes, unconsciously, we are ready to partake in deception for the interest of social dignity, just for the reason of keeping it a secret. We say, \"Good song.\" \"Heart, you don\\'t look healthy under it, no\" Or say, this is my favorite, \"You know what, I just deleted that email from the spam folder. I\\'m sorry.\" But there are also times when we want to be part of the trick. And that can cost us drastically. Last year, $ 991 billion in damages were recorded only from corporate fraud in America. That's only a small fraction under a trillion dollars. That makes up about seven percent of total revenue. This is an example of where fraud can cost billions. Consider the case of Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like the cases of Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, when the lie can even betray our state can compromise security and undermine the development of democracy, they can cause the death of those who protect us Cheating is really a serious topic This jerk, Henry Oberlander, was an effective diploma rogue. British authorities say he could be the man who has damaged the entire Western banking system. And you can't find this person on Google, you can't find it anywhere. He had once interviewed her, and said: \"Look, I\\'ve got a rule.\" And that was Henry's rule, he said, \"Look, everyone is ready to give you something. They are ready to give you something for whatever you are eager to have. \" And this is the essence. If you don't want to be fooled, you should know what are you eager for? This is the fact that we are inclined to admit it. We would like to be better husbands, better wives, smarter, with more power, longer, richer and the list goes on indefinitely. The lie is an attempt to fill this void a way to connect our desires and fantasies about what we would like to be, and how we would like to be, with who we really are. And it is absurd if we want to fill these gaps with lies and lies These days, some studies have concluded that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times. You know, most of these are white lies. But in another study, aliens are said to lie more than three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. (Laughter) And when we first hear this data, we are drawn to it. We can't believe how much lies prevail everywhere. In essence we are all against it. But if you look a little deeper the plot just thickens. We lie to strangers more than our peers. Living people lie more than those who are less socialized. Men lie eight times more about themselves than for others. As women lie more to protect others. If you're a middle-aged married couple, you will find the partner in one of 10 different cases. Now you may think this is wrong. And while you are unmarried, the number goes to three. The lie is complex. It is fabricated in the factory of our daily, private and personal lives. We are deeply frustrated by this reality. We have even introduced the lie as a necessary daily basis, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes only because we do not understand the spaces of our lives. This is the second bitter truth about the lie. We are against lying, but we are secretly in favor of it in the ways that our society has condemned for centuries and for centuries and centuries. The lie is as old as the breathing of mankind. It's part of our culture, of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare, Bible, World News. (Laughter) Lie has a lot of value for us as human beings. Searchers have great knowledge the more intelligent the species, the more brains they have, the more apt they are to cheat and lie. Now you can remember Kokon. Is there anyone who remembers Coconut, Coco, gorillas being taught sign language? Koko was trained to communicate with sign language. Here is Koko with her kitten. It's her charming kitty, full of fur. Koko once blamed her kitten for problems with the gloss of the sink by its wall. (Laughter) We are well-trained to be the leaders of a package. And it starts very early in time How long? Babies will pretend to cry, will pause, to see who is appearing and then they will come back and cry again. One year olds learn these puzzling secrets. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. The five-year-olds lie like this, completely straightforward. They manipulate through jokes. Nine-year-olds are experts at hiding the consequences of actions. By the time you enter high school you will find under one of the nine possible cases. And the moment we step into the job of being a family keeper we enter different distributed worlds with fake digital friends, media of party bias, clever identity thieves, bank failures like that Ponzi Schemers, an epidemic trick - in short, as one author calls it a post-reality society. It has been very confusing for a long time. What are you doing? Well, there are some measures we can take to brighten our way. Liquid detectives are trained and come to the truth in 90 percent of cases. The rest of us are ourselves 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars, and bad liars. But there are no original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques. So what will I do is that I'm going to show you two patterns of cheating. And then we'll look at and analyze them, and find the features for ourselves. Let's start with the speech. (Video) Bill Clinton: I want you all to hear me. And I'll say it again I haven't had sex with that wife, Mrs. Lewinsky. Never like I told someone to lie, never single, never. And these accusations are all false I need to get back to work for the American people Thank you. Pamela Meyer: OK, what were the talkative signs? Well first we heard what it means non-protocol denial. Studies show that people are very predictive of their denials will use the official language rather than the informal one. We also heard a little about the distant phrase \"that woman.\" We know that liars irresponsibly distance themselves by their subject using language as a powerful weapon. Now, if Bill Clinton had said \"Well, I\\'m right ...\" or the famous Richard Nixon, \"With All Sincerity ....\" he would be a dead bypass for every liar I know that qualified language, as it is called, if it so qualifies further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated the question completely, or if he had filled his account with a small detail - and we're all glad he didn't - he would have hidden himself further. Freud had his rights. Freud said, look, there is more than one speech here: \"No mortal man can keep a secret. If the lips don\\'t speak, he speaks with his fingers. \" And we all do it, no matter the power. We all deal with fingerprints I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss Kahn with Obama which are being agreed upon by fingerprints. (Laughter) Now this brings us to another model, which is body language. With body language, that's what we should do. You just have to throw your assumptions out the door. Let science have a little patience with your knowledge. Because we think liars play all the time. Well listen to this, they are known to freeze their upper bodies when they are lying. We think liars don't look us in the eye. Well listen to this, they look you in the eye more sec just to make up for that myth. We always think of the warmth and the smile sow sincerity and loyalty But a trained lie detector it can detect a mile-long smile. Can you all identify the pretentious smile? You can consciously control them muscles on your cheek. But the real smile is in the eyes, it stays in the eyes. They cannot be controlled consciously, especially if you overuse Botox. Don't overuse Botox, no one will think you're honest. Now we will look at some spots. Can you tell what is going on in the conversation? Can you start seeing the lies discrepancies between people's actions and words? Now I know it's really noticeable but when you are having a conversation to someone you suspect is cheating on you, Behavior, to date, is the greatest indicator of truth. An honest person will be a collaborator. They will tell you they are on your side. They will be enthusiastic. They will express readiness and help to get to the truth. They will be ready for ideas, suspicious names, and provide details. They\\'ll say, \"Hey, maybe it was those payroll guys who forgot to mention. \" They will get angry if they feel they are being unfairly accused throughout the interview, not just in separate sheets; they will be frustrated throughout the interview. If you ask honestly what should we do with those check guys, an honest person has a lot of opportunities recommend a strict sentence rather than a mild one Let's say you have the same conversation with a rogue. This person can withdraw, look down, lower your voice to rest, to behave like a herky-jerky. Ask a rogue to tell their story, they will fill it with full details in some unnecessary places. And then they will re-tell the story in chronological order. And what a trained investigator does is that they get into some sketches and subtle ways for a few hours, and will ask that person to tell the story once again and they will look at the jolts, the stuttering, and will ask him some questions that conclude this is a hoax. Why do they do this? Well we all do the same thing. We practice our words, but rarely do we exercise gestures. We say \"Yes\", we shake hands, \"No\" We tell very compelling stories, and we move our arms. We plead guilty to serious crimes, and we smiled as we walked away from them. And that smile is called \"beast fun\". And we'll see that in some video sequences, but we'll start - for those of you who don't know it, this is the candidate for president, John Edwards who shocked America when she accepted a child out of wedlock. We will see him talking about the paternity test. Watch it now if you can see it he says \"Yes\" while shaking his head for \"No\" shaking a little even the arms. (Video) John Edwards: I would be happy to participate. I know it's impossible for this kid to be mine because of the timing of the events that happened So, I know it's impossible. I'm happy to do the paternity test, and see it happening. Interviewer: Will you do it soon? And it's someone - JE: Well, I'm the only person, the only person who is part of this test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: All right, these head movements are easier to catch if you look at them only once. There will be some when someone makes an expression hiding the other flowing fast like a flash Killers are known to cause distress. Your new partner may shake your hand to celebrate, to go to lunch with you and then display a sense of anger. None of us will become an overnight face recognition expert but I can teach you something that is really dangerous, and easy to learn and that is the expression of contempt. In anger, you got two people in the same field. Still this is a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to despair, you are overbearing. It is related to moral superiority. And for that reason, healing is very, very difficult. Here's how it looks. It is marked by a corner drawn in and out. It is the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt, even if the fraud goes down - and it doesn't happen often - look the other way, go the other direction reconsider the agreement, say \"No thanks. I will not come for just a little weave. Thank you\" Science has revealed many, many indicators. We know, for example that liars often change the norm of ignorance and the legs lead them to the exit. They will receive obstructive objects inserting them between yourself and the person they are interviewing They will change their tone too often reducing the volume. This is the agreement. These behaviors are only behaviors. They are not evidence of fraud. They are just red flags. We are human beings We often make deceptive gestures in many places all day. And these gestures do not have much significance. But when you see them being grouped, then that is the sign. See, hear, investigate, ask some difficult questions, get out of that comfortable position of acquaintance, but go down that path of curiosity, still ask questions, be more dignified, and treat the person you are talking to with a report. Don\\'t try to be like them in \"Law & Rule\" or like in other programs punching their subjective thoughts. Don't be too aggressive because it doesn't work. And we talked a little how to communicate makes us lie and how to discover a liar. And as I promised, we will now see what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers - one is lying, one is telling the truth. And both have surfaced by studio David Matsumoto from California. And I think they are a brilliant example how the truth is revealed in reality. This article, Diane Downs shot her children from close dissonance, sent them to the hospital while they were bleeding all the way, saying that a stranger had done this to her children. And you will see it in the video too that she can't even pretend to be a doting mother. What do you want to see here is an incredible mismatch amidst the horrific events she describes and her very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see a double pleasure in this video (Video) Diane Downs: At night when I closed my eyes, I saw Christ extending his hand while I was giving the car, and blood was starting to flow from his mouth. And that - it will probably disappear with time - but I don't believe it. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'll show you a video of a currently worried mother, Erin Runnion, facing her daughter's killers in court. Here you will not see pretentious emotions, but only a normal expression of a mother in agony. (Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement in the third anniversary of the night you took my baby, and you hurt him, you broke it, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she has fought, I know she has fought against you. But I know she's watching you with her gorgeous brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill him. And I don't understand and I want to never understand. PM: OK, there is no point in doubting the truth of these emotions. Now technology is about the truth of what it looks like is advancing, as is science. We know, for example that we also have specialized eye detectors or infrared scanners, MRIs that can decode the signals our body outputs when we want to cheat. And these technologies will serve each of us as a solution to fraud, and one day they will come up with very interesting results. But also at the same time you have to ask yourself: You will want your side during the meeting someone who has been trained to find the truth or any person who will draw a 400-pound electroencephalogram along the door? The lie detectors rely on human tools. They know, as someone said, \"The character that you are in the dark.\" And what's very interesting is that nowadays we have very little darkness. Our world is illuminated 24 hours a day. It's transparent with blogs and social networks transmitting the movements of the new generation of people who have made the choice to live their lives in public. It's a noisy world. And, a challenge we have is to remember distribution, which is not honesty. Our craze for twittering or writing can blind us to the fact that the details of human behavior, integrity and character they are very important, and that is what will always matter. So in such a noisy world, surely it will make sense to us to be a little more clear about our moral code. When you combine the science of detecting fraud with the art of seeing, listening, you distance yourself from cooperating with a liar. You start this path being a little clearer, because it annoys all the people around you, and say, \"Hey, my world, our world, it has to be honest. My world will be one where it will have a lot of power where the lie is recognized and marginalized. \" And when you do that, the terrain around you will shift slightly. And that's the truth. Thank you ) Applause)", "kF4ju6j6aLE": "in the year 1919 a virtually unknown German mathematician named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and in some ways very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of that is in addition to left-right back-forth and up-down gluts to propose that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see now when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea sometimes that all it is both bizarre but has nothing to do with the world around us this particular idea however although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong and at the end I'll discuss experiments which in the next few years may tell us whether it's right or wrong this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research so I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions so where do we go to begin need a bit of backstory go to 1907 this is a year when Einstein is masking the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project to try to understand fully the grand pervasive force of gravity and in that moment there were many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved Newton had given the world the theory of gravity late 1600s that works well describes the motion of planets the motion of the moon and so forth the motion of apocryphal apples falling from trees hitting people in the head all of that could be described using Newton's work but Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity he had been unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the Sun 93 million miles away somehow defect the motion of the earth how does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence and that as a task to a Jain Stein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found so Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself the idea goes like this imagine space is a substrate of all there is Einstein said space is nice and flat if there's no matter present but if there is matter in the environment such as the Sun it causes the fabric of space to warp to curve and that communicates the force of gravity even the earth warps space around it now look at the moon the moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence we go to a full frame view of this the earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the sun's presence that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations it really works it describes the data and this gained Einstein prominence around the world and that is what got Colusa thinking he like Einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory that's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas one set of principles one master equation if you will so Coolidge's said to himself Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space in fact space and time to be more precise maybe I can play the same game with the other known force which was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about you know the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth so Colusa says maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves that raised a question warps and curves in what Einstein had already used up space and time warps and curves to describe gravity didn't seem to be anything else to warp a curve so Colusa said well maybe there are more dimensions of space he said if I want to describe one more force maybe I need one more dimension so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space not three and imagine that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension now here's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in the universe with four space dimensions not three he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions those were for gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension and when he looked at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force amazing it just popped out he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming victory that he had found the unified theory now clearly Colusa was a man who took theory very seriously he in fact there's a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim he read a book a treatise on swimming then toven to the ocean this is a man who would risk his life on theory now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded to questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions of space where are they we don't seem to see them and number two does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world around us now the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named Oskar Klein he suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties there might be big easy to see dimensions but there might also be tiny curled up dimensions curled up so small even though they're all around us that we don't see them let me show you that one visually so imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic lights in Manhattan in Central Park that's it's kind of irrelevant but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint but you and I all know that it does have some thickness it's very hard to see it though from far away but if we zoom in and take their perspective to say a little ant walking around little ants are so small that they can access all the dimensions the long dimension but also this clockwise counterclockwise direction and I hope you appreciate this it took so long to get these ants to do this but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts big and small and the idea is that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself I can only show of course two dimensions on a screen some of you guys will fix that one day but anything that's not flat in the screen is a new dimension goes smaller smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea you could have additional curled up dimensions here is a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them but if you were a little ultra-microscopic ant walking around you can walk in the big dimensions that we all know about that's like the grid part but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that's so small that we can't see with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself the idea is there could be more dimensions as we see there now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that I asked does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world well it turns out that Einstein includes and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time and in detail it didn't work in detail for instance they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many people worked on it but by the 40s certainly by the 50s this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away until something wonderful happened in our age in our era a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself many others around the world it's called super string theory as you were indicating and the wonderful thing is that super string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions but when we study super string theory we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling new form so let me just tell you how that goes super string theory what is it well it's a theory that tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental indivisible uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a candle and a holder and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of so we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents so deep inside we all know you go sufficiently far down you have atoms we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story they have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks that is where conventional ideas stop here is the new idea of string theory deep inside any of these particles there is something else there's something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string that's where the idea of string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw on a cello can vibrate in different patterns these can also vibrate in different patterns they don't produce different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us so these ideas are correct this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy vibrating in different frequencies the different frequencies produce the different particles the different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us and there you see unification because matter particles electrons and quarks radiation particles photons gravitons are all built up from one entity so matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory and here is the catch when you study the mathematics of string there you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space it doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space nor 5 nor 6 finally you can study the equations and show that it works only in a universe that has ten dimensions of space and one dimension of time leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein that our world when appropriately described has more dimensions than the ones that we see now you might think about that and say well ok you know if you have extra dimensions and they're really tightly curled up yeah perhaps perhaps we won't see them if they're small enough but you know if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there you make them small enough and we won't see them either that is true one of the other predictions of string theory no that's not one of the other predictions of string theory but it raises the question are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions or do they tell us something about the world and the remaining time I'd like to tell you two features of them first is many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question is this when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe these are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons and quarks the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do now the string theory often answer not yet but we believe the answer for why those numbers have devised they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions and the wonderful thing is if those numbers had any other values than the known ones the universe as we know it wouldn't exist this is a deep question why those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers if I had 20 dials up here and I'll let you come up and fiddle with those numbers almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear so can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggests that those twenty numbers have to do with the extra dimensions let me show you how so when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory it's not one extra dimension as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions they have a very rich intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a claw be a shape name isn't all that important but as you can see the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it so what is the physical implication though relevant to those twenty numbers consider this if you look at the instrument of French horn notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument now in string theory all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate so just as those air streams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns and the geometry within which they are moving so let me bring some strings into the story and if you watch these little fellas vibrating around they'll be here in a second right there notice that the way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions so if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like we don't yet but if we we should be able to calculate the allowed notes the allowed vibrational patterns and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is now the second issue that I want to finish up with is how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world or can we actually test for these extra dimensions and we think this is I think very exciting that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions here's how it goes in CERN Geneva Switzerland a machine is being built called a Large Hadron Collider it's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often those particles will be aimed at each other so there's a head-on collision the hope is that if the collision has enough energy it may act some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions forcing it to enter into the other dimensions how would we know it well we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision compare it to the amount of energy before and if there's less energy after the collision than before this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually so imagine we have a certain kind of particles called a graviton that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out if the extra dimensions are real but here's how the experiment will go you take these particles you slam them together you slam them together and if we are right some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions so this is the kind of experiment that we will be looking at in the next five seven to ten years or so and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions then when we began this will show that the extra dimensions are real and to me this is a really remarkable story and a remarkable opportunity going back to Newton with absolute space didn't provide anything but an arena a stage in which the events of the universe take place Einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp and curve that's what gravity is and now string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electromagnetism all together in one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime amazing possibility thank you very much", "pni_kDv9BsU": "good morning I recognize what we're gonna talk about this morning is a little bit different than what you guys usually think about as you're doing your daily jobs and things like that but you know Lizzie and Shireen both mentioned a little a minute ago that everybody lies right I mean you all probably been lied to in the past maybe even told a lie or two in the past do I have anybody in the room is gonna tell me they never lie no one okay that's good at least I don't see anyone with the lights on would it surprise you if I told you actually let's do a little experiment first I want you to find someone in the room and I want you to point at them I know it's rude but I want you to point at them and as you're pointing I'm going to point at you who are you Aaron I'm gonna point at Aaron so find someone in the room point at them and then look around to see who is staring at you who's pointing at you okay so then I'm gonna hold your hand up and with this being five and this being zero I want you to end up like everybody to do this for just a moment with this being this big zero this being five tell me how many times you think that person has lied in the last 24 hours okay now look around the room and just just look around the room and see what people are doing and saying okay look around the room okay you put your hands down you can put your hands down let me start by saying you guys are really really polite group because I saw a lot of these I saw a couple of these few of these I didn't have any flashers though normally I do this trainee I got people with both hands flashing they take their shoes off that they could talk about how many times they think people had lied all right would it surprise you if I told you that a person lies an average of ten times a day okay now I know some of you sitting there going no no that's not true I don't like 10 times a day but think about it for just a moment when I talk about lying 10 times a day I'm talking about things like somebody asking how you're doing and you have a splitting headache and you say fine because you don't want to get into it all right so when I talk about lies I'm talking about a complete range from those little white lies that we tell either not to hurt someone's feelings or to keep a conversation from going in a direction we don't want it to go in to those really big bold-faced lies where I didn't do it okay why is this important to you guys why is knowing what a lie looks like to you is important to you whether you're hiring employees you know whether you got a screening process going whether you have an investigation because someone's been stealing from your company and you need to put yourself in an investigative mindset now any of those things that you touch as executives and retail or folks that are involved in retail it's important if you're a buyer and you're going out looking to see if you're getting the best deal on the things that you're looking to buy do you want to know if that's persons telling you the truth or do you want to know if you have a little bit more wiggle room so the purpose of teaching you about lying today and I'm not going to tell you everything about it because we don't have all day but I'm going to touch on the things that are most important to you and I hope that you'll find that they do have something to do with what you guys do on a day to day basis okay if I forget to say this and I usually do I want to say it before I leave when you finish this 45 minutes with me you're gonna be dangerous you're gonna know just enough to be dangerous all right so don't take this home and use it on your significant others not gonna lead you where you want to go children however use it all the time on kids all right I have a 16 year old son if his lips are moving he's lying all right so just setting you up with that so let's get into this just a little bit about me I think they told you it's all over the place actually I am former CIA I still do a lot of work with them but the point is is it's in the CIA that I learned what it looks like when people are lying I have a master's in forensic psychology and education I spent over 20 years with the agency developed a screening program with inside the agency and we actually take this program this to spy the live program all over the world and teach people about lying all over the world so people say to me well Susan if you're teaching everybody what lying looks like can't they use that against you all right if I learn to lie if Aaron learns to lie and I'm interviewing her for a job and she's lying will I see it if she knows how to beat me the good thing is there's so many different things about lying that you can't hide them all so Aaron may be able to lie to me with a couple of sentences but sooner or later I'm gonna figure out she's lying and then I'm gonna go try to find out what the truth is okay so enough about me let's get into this the way I want to start this is I want to show you a brief video all right and I want you to tell me whether Jamie this young lady right here at the end of this video is lying to me or not all right so all and you came into the room today with some gut that tells you whether someone's being truthful or not right we all think we know what deception looks like we all think we know what truth looks like so with that gut that you guys have it tells you whether somebody's truthful or not I want you to judge Jamie we ready to go okay my first question for you TV is what involvement did you have in the companies recently just started bars run for County activities oh nine Oh  these are under direct mr. Glenn to backdate any contracts no of course not  prior to the recent audit that uncovered these accounting irregularities did you have any knowledge that mr. Glenn was back dating contracts no I mean in fact if I had knowledge about that then I would speak up and say something  is there any reason that a forensic computer review would uncover any communication with mr. Glyn regarding this matter no of course I don't have any communication with him regarding this at all  at any time the mr. Glenn ever reveal or discusses efforts to manipulate the company's accountings with you know if he had then I would have told someone fired him gotten something something would have happened if I knew anything  Jimmy why should we believe that you're not I've always had a very good reputation with the company I have no enemies in the company you know when you know i I've always done my best and I believe that I have a very good reputation with that and people trust me and I I would never do something like that especially for something that I've worked so hard at  what do you think should happen to the singing manager who directed this should learn to backdate this contract he should be fired and go to jail and there should be serious consequences  would you be willing to certify in writing that you had nothing to do with these accounting irregularities yes of course I'll sign it right now okay so this was a situation where there's an investigation going on in a company because the accountant had been cooking the books and when we went in to do the investigation we asked him why he was cooking the books they were getting ready to go into a sell the company they were looking to raise the value of the company but he said he did it specifically because he was told to we asked him who told him and he didn't want to tell us so we investigated we interviewed a whole bunch of people Jamie being one of them now I heard a couple of people say she was lying right off the top right and maybe she was and maybe she wasn't but as that interview went on were there times when you caught yourself going no I think she's being truthful and other times when used to nap that's a lie right how do we know whether she's being truthful or not what are we looking for in there let me ask you this question even if Jamie was being truthful did she have a reason to be nervous absolutely right so how do we know whether her nervousness or whether her behavior is a result of nervousness or whether it's a result of not being truthful how do we know that that's what we want to learn right if you have somebody sitting in front of you for a job interview or you're you're talking to someone in a company all your employees in a company because there's been a major theft or there's even been a little theft do those folks have a reason to be nervous absolutely they want to make sure you're getting it right they want to make sure they're coming across in the way they they should come across so how do we know the difference let's take a look at a few things there are six keys to knowing whether someone's being truthful or not or where someone's being deceptive we're gonna look at all of these individually we've got analyzed versus speculate okay what do I mean by that can I look at anybody in this room and say they're there lying to me just by looking at them just by the way they're sitting all right manage your bias every single one of us in this room has a bias we may know what that bias is but we may not know all right just happens week it comes across people recognize it but we don't see it we want to recognize evasiveness what does that look like when someone's trying to evade telling me the truth or it may telling me a deception we want to be aware of aggression aggression is one of the major keys for people being deceptive we're all gonna also gonna look at convey versus convince what do I mean by convey versus convincing and finally we're gonna look at some of those nonverbal cues any of you folks who used to watch lie to me that's what you saw with a nonverbal that's what you saw with the nonverbal so we're gonna look at some of those alright so let's get started oops what the wrong way when I talk about analyze versus analysing versus speculation what I want to look at is how a person is reacting to things okay so I need I need to find somebody who's sitting like I want them to actually you see the gentleman in the back right there who's got his arms resting okay if he were crossing his arms right here like this okay how do we view this behavior how we always been told this behavior is closed standoffish and stuff like that right and a lot of people assume that closed behavior means that they're trying to trying to manipulate me alright they're trying to come across as being truthful alright I'm just gonna hold myself right here so that nobody knows that I'm lying well you know what maybe he's standing that way because he's cold maybe he's standing that way because it's comfortable for him alright that just may be a habit form I don't want to turn around and say look close posture equals deception because if I do that I'm getting myself in trouble so a lot of us look at global behavior all right we look at weather they shift all the time we look at weather weather they you know do some of the stuff that Jamie did when she scratched her nose all those sort of things we give way too much weight to global behavior we want to do away with that that is speculation I don't want to speculate why why that gentleman in the back is sitting there with his arm across like that alright what what I want to do in other words is I want to identify that the behaviors that I see in here are a direct result of my question so if I ask Aaron Aaron did you did you take the missing merchandise alright and and and she's sitting like that that's that's bad that would if I look at that as a global evaluation that's bad I don't want to give her that alright I want it I want to see the behaviors and hear the behaviors as a result of the question I ask and it'll make sense in a minute I want to identify the stimulus the stimulus in this case whether it's an investigation whether it's a screening interview whether you're talking to someone that you want to employ in your organization the stimulus is going to be the question that I ask all right during any interview during any communication people are going to move I want that movement to come when I ask the question okay not when they're just sitting here having a conversation and never make again more sense in a minute I want to focus on the behaviors that are directly as I said we associate it with the response do you say and do something as a response of my question okay one of those deceptive behaviors and I'm going to rely on what we call timing and clusters and this is really the big deal the timing of clusters thing so for example when I ask a question I want that person to show me a deceptive behavior within the first five seconds after I ask that question if they don't show me a deceptive behavior of the list that I'm going to show you in a minute and within five seconds they're not lying to me they're not lying to me okay I need to see you're here one of those behaviors in the first five seconds if I see the first behavior in the first five seconds I don't have to see another behavior for two or three or five or ten seconds all right but I do have to see that first one in the first five seconds now not trying to be catty here but I've seen CEOs that can live for 15 minutes on one question okay there's a behavior I'm going to show you that allows you to see that how that happens but what I want to make sure is that the first be happens in the first five seconds so this is what it looks like you're all bright people you know what five seconds is okay my other my other thing I want to pay attention to are clusters and this is what makes a difference in our deceptive behaviors versus other people's deceptive categories and techniques I want to see more than one deceptive behavior within that first five-second right within that answer so I've got these which are verbals ends that are non verbals I want to see at least two or more behaviors for that to be a deceptive answer does that make sense so by c1 I might not like it I'm going to pay attention to it but I really want two or more so if I'm saying that my first behavior has to be within the first five seconds right and I need two or more deceptive indicators do I have a deceptive answer here I do right now you notice that I've got one that that happens before I actually finish the question that question stimulus I'm asking you a question and I get a nonverbal deceptive behavior I'm gonna count that even though it's not within my first five seconds why do you think up someone might give me a nonverbal or a verbal deceptive behavior before I finish the question exactly they're starting to frame their answer and guess what they think faster than I talk all right they say that the average person talks 120 to 150 words a minute the brain goes much faster than that okay some some behavior let's say it goes at least 10 times faster some be able to say you can't measure because we don't think in words we think in concepts all right so if somebody gives me a verbal response or a nonverbal response before I finished my question it's simply because their brain is going faster than my mouth is all right and then I've got that outlier there that nonverbal that lies outside of that first five seconds am I going to count that what I am right Aaron I'm gonna count why am I gonna count it exactly because I had one that happened within the first five seconds right so any behaviors that I keep singing that fall outside that first five seconds before I ask another question is gonna be part of my cluster so if I've got one I've got seven here right that tells me I've got a liar that tells me I've got a person who's not being candid and by the way we never call him a liar we just say they're not being candid okay so I'm not I've got somebody who's not being candid with me what if I had just two inside that first five seconds would that be a truthful answer would that be a deceptive answer it would be deceptive right now is that lie right there a bigger lie than the person who only shows me two deceptive behaviors we have no way of knowing right we have no way of knowing that that two deceptive behaviors could be my son telling me it isn't at homework I'm sorry that one could be my son telling me he doesn't have homework all right the person who shows me two deceptive indicators might be a really really bad person but it comes down to how much someone's buying into the lie how important is it for me to convince you I'm being truthful and at the end of the day when people are doing this kind of stuff what they're trying to do is manipulate us okay manipulate us to believe them all right manipulation is a big thing but that's what they're doing they're doing and saying things to manipulate our thoughts about them okay so timing in clusters that's our most important thing timing in clusters we want to manage your bias all right now it says up here that I want to ignore truthful behavior why do you think I want to ignore truthful behavior any thoughts  good okay right we're inherently good is everybody inherently good I mean she's right she's absolutely right you know look we were all raised to be good people well at least 90% of us in the room were raised to be good people I can't speak for everybody right but we were taught lying was wrong right and your parents tell you lying was not a good thing to do all right did your parents ever say to you look if you lie you're gonna be in twice as for trouble that you would have been if you had just told me the truth and done something wrong right so we know lying is wrong at least that's that's what we've been taught that lying is wrong deceptive people can give us truthful answers so if you ask a question of a person that they're comfortable answering they can answer that truthfully okay any discussion that you have any interview any any again anything that you're doing you're your buyer you're talking to folks and you want to get to the truth is this your lowest price and people are doing things to convince you that that's the lowest price let's start with that okay they are going to do things they're going to say things to convince you that that's the lowest price you are having a conversation with them you're trying to determine is it the lowest price what else can I get just lots of questions that you have you're taking notes you're thinking follow-up questions it is like getting a drink of water out of a firehose there's too much going on if I tell you forget about looking for truthful behavior because you will see it on some questions forget about looking at truthful behavior then that cuts your job half in half right now you're getting a drink of water out of a garden hose as opposed to out of a firehose all right it makes things a lot easier but truthful people or deceptive people who give you truthful answers make it look like they're good folks they're cooperative folks they're gonna give you everything that you need to get all right in reality what they're doing is convincing you that they're being truthful because you saw one good answer not several good answers okay for this a moment let's go back to Jamie what did Jamie do that made you think she was deceptive what'd she do somebody said somebody said she was lying right out of the box what does she do  okay she can't she touched her face her feet were tapping what else she was blinking on too quick to answer all the questions okay conversely what did she do that you liked did all of you think she was guilty good what did she do that you liked okay okay that's good and were you the one that yelled out she's lying okay no no no I knew it came from that direction but but that's good right so it was one of these Scituate of these situations where you were yes yes no yes no that is every conversation that you will have with people sounds good sounds bad sounds good sounds bad how do we split between the two did I see it hand up over there yes  yeah I didn't decorate the room I just did the interview but no you're absolutely right and that's when I talk about people manipulating our perception manipulating us to believe them that's exactly what I'm talking about because there were some questions that she answered pretty pretty nicely right there are some questions that she didn't what we what we do in a lot of situations is we ask people for example we do an investigation inside the organization you know one of our questions will be what do you do here and most of the people will just give you a job just hi a job title alright but the people that we know are already setting out to manage our perception will give us this long Job Description okay that goes way beyond what we're asking for so they gave us so much information and the purpose of that is again to convince us that they're good people well what happens when I hear if I if I'm a novice and I hear a truthful answer I start to think that's a good person it's a self-fulfilling prophecy okay I start to believe they're good I start to believe that they want to they want to cooperate and when I talk about the halo effect that's what I'm talking about so if I'm not looking for deceptive behavior and looking for truthful behavior instead I'm gonna find truthful behavior and it's gonna convince me early on that that person is good and then I'm gonna miss the bad I like the fact that you guys brought up a couple things that's gonna be here later I like the fact that you saw the feet moving I like the fact you saw the nose thing scratching your nose but which is right is she truthful or is she deceptive what makes us right alright so we're gonna talk that we're gonna get more into that alright I want to recognize evasiveness have you ever asked someone a question and they've talked for 10 minutes and then you realize they never answered the question you asked okay right I mean it it happens all the time if you ask somebody if you ask somebody is that your best price and they go through all these things tell you all these reasons why that's their best price but they haven't said no okay they've not given you the answer that you've asked for if you're if you're interviewing somebody for a job and you ask them if they've ever had problems with a with a provider or problems at a job and they give you all these great reasons for why they're a good employee but they never answer whether or not they had any problems in a job but we don't hear it because we're not thinking we're not listening for whether they answer the question or not we're just listening for whether answer so we need to make sure that they're actually giving us the information we're asking for the other thing is what we call failure to deny the most important thing to the honest person is giving you that answer denying if they didn't do something that's the most important thing the truth is their biggest ally so they're gonna want to deny something if they haven't done it okay they're gonna want to deny anything that is going to make them look better if they haven't done it so that's we need to listen for people to deny stuff then we have what we call exclusionary qualifiers now by exclusionary qualifiers I mean things like saying for the most part fundamentally not really not really exclusionary qualifiers beg for a follow up question all right absolutely beg for a follow up question now poor Aaron sat here right in front of me so I'm gonna be picking on her for the whole presentation but let's say okay I've met Aaron let's say I met Aaron last night and I really want to make a good impression with you guys so I go to Aaron this morning and I say hey Aaron look do you think what I'm wearing is okay for today now I realize I realize the conflict here because I'm sitting in front of a whole bunch of retail people okay some of you who sell clothes so I realize I'm putting myself right in the mix here but let's say the Aaron Darren do you see anything wrong with what I'm wearing and her response is not really  think about this for a moment not really okay so you know if I'm in my optimistic mood which doesn't happen very often but I'm in an optimistic mood and I hear not really I think oh I'm okay right what I'm wearing is okay but if I don't hear it from an Austin output optimistic standpoint I hear it from a negative one I go oh really so my next question to Aaron is gonna be what that's my next question to Aaron okay well Aaron if there's if there's something you had to pick that you don't like about it what would it be you don't have to answer that I just want to see if you would know but you hear what I'm saying if somebody says not really it's begging a follow-up so my fault it's got to come because if I don't ask that follow-up I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get it all right I'm not gonna hear it I'm not gonna hear what the real answer is so if somebody says to you well fundamentally this is the way we do things or for the most part this is the things that we that this is the way we do things they're cutting something out we want to know what it is that they're cutting out so you have to ask that follow-up question well okay that's what you do basically but what did you do in this situation okay so that's exclusionary qualifiers I have used one of these before all right aggression attacking the questioner let's say you've had a theft and you're interviewing all of your employees all right and and you ask them did you did you have anything to do with this did you remove any of this information right and make just come back at you and say you guys always think it's me you know it's just because the way I was born or how I dressed or whatever if you always think it's me and they question they attack you you know how and you don't even in this store you don't even know what goes on people walk in and out all the time that's big all right when I talk about different behaviors there's some behaviors that way more than others aggression is one of those okay if you have somebody who jumps down your throat because you ask them a question I don't even care if it's your kid you know yet you say to your kid what did you do last night and they're like why are you always asking me this you don't trust me why don't you trust me okay what ever ever done all right you got a problem you got a problem all right attacking a third party all right it's the same sort of thing you know it locates the stores fog the store doesn't have very good security all right it's it's it's you know we have we don't have what we need in here you know you guys never bring the right stuff in of course that's gonna disappear because we can't sell it all right they're attacking the third party right again it's a big deal any time you're talking about aggression any sort of attack it's big demonstrating an inappropriate level of concern opposite ends of the spectrum you ask them a question you ask him like an important question and they're like oh please you know oh here we go again those sort of things or they just get angry they go from 0 to 124 for really no reason you just ask a question that's it let me give you a small example of that and you know in aggression can be words I mean concern can be words or it can be it can be what they do on their face any of you guys in here remember Scott Peterson great that killed us was convicted of killing his wife and unborn child Laci okay eventually he was convicted but before when he was sitting in jail there was an interview that they had with Diane Sawyer and leading up to it and Diane said but Scott here's the question everybody in America wants to know did you kill your wife now probably most of us would sit there and if we hadn't killed our spouses would try to figure out the right or would know the right things to say what Scott Peterson did and said was he smiled first thing he did was he smiled he goes I love my wife no no I wouldn't I wouldn't have kept I wouldn't kill lazy but he smiled how weird is that you made the hair on the back of my neck stand up somebody's just asked you if you killed your wife and unborn child and you're smiling okay so anyway in an appropriate level of concern now here's where I want to get into what you guys are talking about a minute ago this can this could convince versus convey if I ask what's your name Tiffany because I'm really tired of picking on poor Aaron even if I ask Tiffany Tiffany did you take the merchandise okay what are the two answers that Tiffany can give me that would let me know whether or not she took the merchandise what are the two appropriate answers that would convey information yes or no yes or no but what if I say Tiffany did you take the missing merchandise and she runs into this hole look I'm a good employee I've been loyal to this company for so long I've never done anything that would give you any reason to think I'm less than than a stellar employee what is she doing here is she conveying information is she trying to convince me of something she's trying to convince me of something right she's trying to convince me she's a good employee that nobody should ever have any question about okay that is what you're going to hear most of the time a convincing statement is the the strongest arrow that any person's going to have in their quiver okay saying I'm a good person I'm a good worker all of those sort of things when you talk about trying to try to manage someone's perception let me think about it think about it for just a moment because maybe Tiffany is a good person maybe Tiffany is a stellar employee maybe she had a bad day she took something and now she doesn't know what to do so when somebody's trying to convince me of something going back to minute ago when I said people can talk they can they can answer a question for ten minutes but never answer the question I asked they can talk all day when I said I've seen CEOs alive for twenty five minutes on a single question that's what I'm talking about they'll start talking about how healthy their company is how great their sales are how wonderful their employee and their management team are what they're doing is trying to convince me not convey information to me okay convincing statements are so strong let me give you another example from history you guys all remember our last name Susan the woman who put her children in the back of the car or in the car and their car seats and Susan Smith thank you how can you forget Smith okay Susan Smith she put her kids in the car seat you know push the car into the like way into the cops and said that somebody had carjacked her car right we were doing a training session for some for some law enforcement in Indiana and these gentlemen happened to be in the class they're from Union South Carolina they happen to be in the class and they came up and they said Hayden we now know how students Smith initially beat us when she came into the police station she ran into the station she's crying she's hysterical somehow I got to hijack my car my kids are in the car citizen did you have anything to do with it Susan Smith's answer was I love my children I would never harm my children why would I hurt my children what did you not hear you didn't hear a denial right you didn't hear her say no I didn't what you did hear her say was I wouldn't hurt my children guess what wouldn't and didn't aren't the same thing somebody says I wouldn't do something it's not the same thing as saying I didn't do something we have to listen for didn't okay we have to listen for the words what people are saying not what we think they say because when our thought doesn't make sense for someone to kill their kids right in fact in fact we said to them we said well what did you say to her and why did she beat you and they said because what she said made sense now for just a moment they hadn't done an investigation yet right she just came in she's crying she's hysterical she's got all this stuff going on they have no proof of anything other than the fact of what she's standing there telling them and so they say you know we said it what did you say what did you say we said what we asked her why she would say that and you know we got this behavior we didn't like this behaviors we finally said to her we said Susan look sometimes things happen and you know your parents your parents get out of control and for just a moment you know just a moment maybe something happened and she just continuing with no I love my children I would never hurt my children blah-blah-blah-blah-blah okay so what we say is when you hear convincing statements and you're you have no investigation in Susan Smith's case what you have to do is go hmm I just heard three protest statements or convincing statements I love my children I would never harm my children I do nothing my children I don't hear a denial if we talk about clusters being two or more do I have a lie absolutely right I've got the I've got the not I'm not answering or not giving me a denial and I've got three what we call convincing statements okay now convincing statements sounds so true or in this particular case eerie beautiful irrefutable let's say this the officers say to Susan so Susan look you say you didn't kill your wife I'll kill your kids prove it prove it and she goes I love my kids I take care of my kids I take him to church they're happy they're well fed they're well clothed all this sort of stuff now mr. police officer what do you have at this point they got nothing so convincing statements sound really true again Tiffany may be a good person but that didn't answer my question okay so guess who I'm gonna be looking at I'm gonna be looking at Tiffany okay referral statements referral statements are statements that people make over and over again to try to convince you didn't do anything wrong all right so let's say let's say this young lady standing up back right here let's say she went outside to go to the bathroom while I'm standing here talking she comes back in and she was hey Susan let me interrupt for just a sec I need you guys to know that there are sort of little green men running around the hallway and what's our first impression of this young lady who just walked in right okay but let's say she does know I know I know it's hard to believe but I'm telling you some little green men running around out there now what are we inclined to do go look right so she's now starting to bring us in we're starting to believe a little bit about what she says that again is perception manipulation all right invoking religion people will talk about you know swear on stack of Bibles I swear to God and the counting world I swear on GAAP you know all these sort of things that that people all these sort of things that people will tell us because let's face it and this more specially in this world of political you know rightness and everybody wanting to be good and not step on anybody's toes somebody throws out religion what are you having your backpack your purse your desk drawer that beats religion okay that's a dangerous dangerous one perception qualifiers are a little different than exclusionary qualifiers perception qualifiers are that that people say and do to dress up their lie to verbally dress up their life things like well to tell you the truth honestly frankly as some of you are maybe sitting in this room and saying Oh crepe these are that's the common phrase for me I'll say that stuff all the time right it's a habit okay you're lucky because we're looking at clusters okay so you get your frankly you get your honestly it's when you start having start having more and more because deception and your answer that we're gonna pay attention okay nonverbals now a lot of times people will say to me well Susan if you say that the behaviors start within the first five seconds I'll beat you and just not do or say anything for five seconds well unfortunately for you a behavioral pause is a deceptive indicator okay now for just a moment you have to think about this because you have to ask yourself if you get a pause so the question makes sense for a pause so if I say the Aaron for example Aaron let's see January 26th ten years ago what were you doing does that allow a pause right okay so it's only fair that she gets a pause there but what if I say so Aaron January 26 ten years ago did you rob the bank of America yet see she answered that pretty quickly right if they had taken her time to think about that answer you guys got to look at your hiring policies okay because that would have been a problem all right verbal nonverbal disconnect what I want you to do it once you do a little trip for me for another little game for me for a moment I want you to look at the person sitting next to you before you do it though look at me I want you to look at the person sitting next to you and I want you to say do you like me okay and I want that person to go yes I like you very much okay and then I want you to switch so do it real quick because we're how much time  okay okay all right okay all right I don't have a lot of time okay did that feel weird did that feel weird all right and that's telling you to do that okay that's telling you to do that and you find it hard to do you're deliberately doing it if you see someone do that it's huge it means their brain is so fried that they're not doing what their body is made to do okay now everything that I'm talking about with example with exceptions to that one verbal nonverbal disconnect is cross-cultural cross-gender you can use it anywhere in the world this one is one of those you cannot all right you can't because they're India for example they that's how they answer all right but every place else you can use the verbal nonverbal disconnect you just have to know your audience a little bit anchor point movements anchor point movements are the things that anchor you to the ground to the world to the earth for example my feet right now would be anchor points if my arms are like this they would be anchor points if you asked me a question and in response to that question I move my arms or my legs that's an anchor point movement all right you mentioned the feet if I'm sitting in a chair my bottom is my anchor point my back is my anchor point my feet are my anchor point feet are always anchor points all right we all women especially ABBA tend to sit with their legs crossed and we have that foot that's dangling we call a hanging anchor point watch it because that's where it's gonna go that person is trying to maintain control of themselves it's going to go to that floating anchor point grooming gestures things that people do to again dress up the lie they might fix their tie they might fix their hair they might look at their watch anything like that that would be dressing up the life physically and then finally hands to the face okay if some if someone is in a flight-or-fight syndrome or flyer fight phase which means that they rather than tell you the truth they're gonna try to keep it in they're gonna do stuff the the blood vessels at the ends of the fingers and the ends start to shrink and itches so they will start playing with their their nose or their ear or scratch their hands or like that so hands to the face are huge okay any questions you want to know the shot at her oh yes sir  there seem to be an art or science around the pauses that you had after every question can you talk a little bit about yes I can it means I'm cutting my can you ask me in the answer question session I do what I'm supposed to do okay all right let's but but you're absolutely right let's look at her real quick think about things that we talked about think about what you guys mentioned earlier about you would like the fact that she was answering his questions more but that's not good okay and she didn't really answer the question so the more people talk the worse it is okay so let's go my first question for you Jimmy is what involvement to do have in the companies recently discovered far as we went accounting activities oh nine  appropriate level of concern feet move did you make you write to mr. Gulen to backdate any contracts no of course not feet move an appropriate level of  prior to the recent audit that uncovered these accounting irregularities did you have any knowledge that mr. Glenn was back dating contracts no I mean in fact if I had knowledge about that then I would speak up and say something  convincing statement I would spoke up move  is there any reason that forensic computer with you would uncover any communication with mr. Glenn regarding this matter no of course I don't have any communication with them regarding this at all I'm okay with that one except for the feet move but that's the only one behavior at anytime mr. Gulen ever reveal or discusses efforts to manipulate the company's accountings with you know if he had then I would have told someone fired and gotten something something would have happened if I knew anything I had some against some convincing statements feet love feet Jamie why should we believe that your I've always had a very good reputation with the company I have no enemies in the company you know and you know I I've always done my best and I believe that I have a very good reputation with that and people trust me and I I would never do something like that especially for something that I've worked so hard at ok I'm gonna end that because I think we all see the convincing statements we see the feet and things like that I'm not going to just go through the rest of the questions how do we feel about her now she's a liar yeah well just so you know at the end of my rope my role in this investigation was not only to find the person who was being deceptive but to confront the person who I thought was being deceptive just so you know she showed over 26 deceptive behaviors in that short interview ok for me it was a neon sign I knew immediately it was her okay so anyway there's the keys to success the ones that we talked about Shireen's gonna come up here I know we got a couple questions so can I answer his question ok they're done so yes I put pauses between my questions and the answer the reason for that is because you make it just south of being uncomfortable people have a tendency to want to fill in quiet spaces and a lot of times they'll do those quat though they'll fill it in with convincing statements or other things that will be deceptive if I don't see anything else then I'll ask the question but I always try to wait at least three or four seconds before I ask my second question because if my if I'm machine-gunning Adam and asking questions it makes them very comfortable to just answer real quickly I have a really quick question for you cuz we're almost out of time but how does it how does all of this work on the phone um good question it does work on the phone obviously you lose the verbal I mean the nonverbal so you don't see the person moving or anything like that but you can hear the chair squeak when they move back and forth in the chair what you'll be paying more attention to is the verbal obviously listening for whether they're doing any things that we that we talked about here and be careful very careful when you're on the phone interviews about mind drift don't be thinking about what your next question be thinking about what they're saying in their answer okay yes that's that's a good question the behavior if you're doing the verbal you account for nervousness okay if you're if you're looking the timing and clusters thing again nervous behaviors nervous behavior but you're looking for the timing and those deceptive behaviors and once you see those you'll start to see the nerve you don't care whether they're nervous okay because people do stuff and you don't know how people manifest nervousness versus deception so you really have to follow the behaviors the timing and clusters and the behaviors because you everybody wants to get it right so we we do and and I gave you the short and dirty of all this stuff there's actually a book out we wrote cost by the lie which has a lot more detail in it and can help you as much as you want a little plug we also do training all around the country if you guys think your company might want their training at one of your your off sites or something like that we would come in and give you a longer presentation our normal presentations like three and a half hours thanks guys  couple quick housekeeping", "_QdPW8JrYzQ": "", "rPh3c8Sa37M": "Translator: Queenie Lee Reviewer: Rhonda Jacobs Hello. (Audience) Hello. My name is Tom Chi, and ever since I was a young child, I was determined to understand how the entire universe worked, and that fascination led me to my first job, at age 15 - I did astrophysical research with the Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory in active galactic nuclei. Now, years after being a scientist and astrophysicist, I slowly kind of matured out of that and entered the world of people. It actually turns out that the world of people is way harder to understand than the entire universe. But I stayed with it, and in the process of being a technologist, an inventor, and an entrepreneur, I've learned a lot about people. What I'm going to talk to you today is a little bit of what I've learned. Because as I learn about people, I get very interested in the gaps that still remain for us as human beings and us as a civilization, relative to the challenges that are in front of us. And one of those gaps that I've seen is around this concept, and the concept is a really simple one. It's the concept that everything is connected. You've probably heard this many, many times, in fact. It's an element of almost every spiritual tradition of humankind throughout all of history. But whenever I hear people talk and mention this phrase that \"we are all connected,\" they do so in a way where it's something they wish that they could believe was true, that it's something that's abstract; that it's esoteric; that it's a thing that is unprovable, but they just really wish the universe was like that. And today I'm here to describe that everything really is connected, and not in some abstract, esoteric way but in a very concrete, direct, understandable way. And I am going to do that with three different stories: a story of the heart, a story of the breath, and a story of the mind. So let's begin. So all of you in this audience today, your hearts are beating right at this moment. And the reason that your hearts beat is because you need to move this molecule through your blood called hemoglobin. And hemoglobin carries this smaller molecule that's called heme B, which is what we see over here. Now, at the heart of heme B is a single atom of iron, so in a way, at the heart of our heart is this little iron atom. And this is actually really a central part of the hemoglobin molecule because this is the thing that allows us to bind oxygen and move that through our circulatory system. But one thing that you may not know is that the only way that iron is created in the universe, is through supernovas and through supermassive stars. So the universe started with basically no iron at all. Hydrogen. Helium - And only through the process of these stars forming, exploding, forming and exploding, was iron able to be created that now courses through each one of our veins. But the story doesn't really end there. Because - why do stars keep forming? Actually, after a supernova happens, it may be a long time before those gases come back together to form a star. So in order to understand how this works, we need to understand why stars would form. Even though there's a couple different ways that stars form, one of the most robust is this process: galactic collisions. And these are images from the Hubble Space Telescope, and they show through a series of panels - which are actually different galaxies because this process takes, like, a half billion to a billion years - different galaxies what the process of a galactic collision would look like. So across the top, you get the galaxies slowly coming together, and in the bottom three frames, you see them smashing into each other, and their interstellar gases mixing, and in the process of doing that, they set on fire with new star formation across the entire galaxy, and whatever remains after the collision. Now, even here is not the end of the story. Because why in the world would galaxies collide? This doesn't seem like a thing that should just happen for no reason. So, to understand this, we're going to need to scoot back way, way more. And here we're at the level of seeing about 100,000 galaxies. So last slide, two galaxies. This slide, 100,000 galaxies. Every one of these dots here is a galaxy that is in our supercluster. And we\\'re that red dot over here, where it says, \"You are here.\" And these glowing lines are not galaxies. These glowing lines are the trajectories that these galaxies are going to take through gravity over the coming billions of years in this beautiful gravitational dance of all these galaxies swirling together in a gravitational structure that we call Laniakea, which in Hawaiian means the immeasurable heaven. And it's this process, the gravitational dance of 100,000 galaxies swirling together, which drive the process of galaxies colliding, which drive massive star formation, which drive the process of creating the iron that courses through each one of our veins with every heartbeat. And in this way, every one of our heartbeats is connected. Now we're going to move to a second story. And this story is about breath. Taking a deep breath is one of the most simple ways to connect with our own bodies - a deeply grounded, calming breath. But taking a deep breath was not something that was possible on this earth three billion years ago. On this slide, we have the composition of the atmosphere of the earth during that time period. We had about the same amount of nitrogen, but we had almost no oxygen at all. So you would be taking a breath in vain three billion years ago. And we actually had a huge amount of carbon dioxide. And the net effect was an almost inhabitable planet. The only organisms that could exist that time were single-celled organisms inside of stromatolites and other closed spaces. Now, luckily for us, one of those organisms that was alive at this time was something called a cyanobacteria. That's a picture of it in the background. And this organism has the special trick that we call \"photosynthesis,\" the ability to go take energy from the sun and transform carbon dioxide into oxygen. And over the course of billions of years, so starting from two and a half billion years ago, little by little these bacteria spread across the planet and converted all that carbon dioxide in the air into the oxygen that we now have. And it was a very slow process. First, they had to saturate the seas, then they had to saturate the oxygen that the earth would absorb, and only then, finally, could oxygen begin to build up in the atmosphere. So you see, just after about 900 million years ago, oxygen starts to build up in the atmosphere. And about 600 million years ago, something really amazing happens. The ozone layer forms from the oxygen that has been released in the atmosphere. And it sounds like a small deal, like we talked about the ozone a couple decades ago, but it actually turns out that before the ozone layer existed, earth was not really able to sustain complex, multicellular life. We had single-celled organisms, we had a couple of simple, multicellular organisms, but we didn't really have anything like you or me. And shortly after the ozone layer came into place, the earth was able to sustain complex multicellular life. There was a Cambrian explosion of life in the seas. And the first plants got onto land. In fact, there was actually no life on land ahead of that. Another way to see this is, this is kind of a chart of pretty much most of the animals that you guys are familiar with. And right at the bottom in time is the formation of the ozone layer. Like nothing that you are familiar with today could exist without the contributions of these tiny organisms over those billions of years. And where are they now? Well actually, they never really left us. The direct descendants of the cyanobacteria were eventually captured by plants. And they're now called chloroplasts. So this is a zoom-in of a plant leaf - and we probably ate some of these guys today - where tons of little chloroplasts are still trapped - contributing photosynthesis and making energy for the plants that continue to be the other half of our lungs on earth. And in this way, our breaths are very deeply united. Every out-breath is mirrored by the in-breath of a plant, and their out-breath is mirrored by our in-breath. I'm going to take a little aside here for a moment with this story. Because imagine for a moment - and this is a thought experiment - imagine you were one of these little organisms two billions year ago. You might be born. You live a couple weeks. You die. And you kind of feel like, well, nothing really changed. I mean, I had no purpose in this life. Like, the world I came to is exactly the same as the world that I left. But what you wouldn't have understood is that every breath that you took contributed to the possibility of countless lives after you - lives that you would never see, lives that we are all a part of today. And it's worth thinking that maybe the meaning of our lives are actually not even within the scope of our understanding. Because it's true of every one of these organisms, and it may also be true of us. Last story of connection is the story of the mind. This is not \"our minds are all connected in some psychic way or some scientifically unexplainable way,\" I'm going to explain the connection of the mind through the simple story of this instrument. This is a piano. And I have actually a good relationship with pianos. Thanks, mom. She gave me piano lessons very early. I think you have to if you're Asian. But - (Laughter) a beautiful thing about this instrument is it is so nuanced and so textured and so complex, and so much beauty can be created from it that people can make an entire career, they can make an entire lifetime out of playing this instrument. Professional musicians, concert pianists get to know this instrument deeply, intimately. And through it, they're able to create with sound in a way that just dazzles us, and challenges us, and deepens us. But if you were to look into the mind of a concert pianist, and you used all the modern ways of imaging it, an interesting thing that you would see is how much of their brain is actually dedicated to this instrument. The ability to coordinate ten fingers. The ability to work the pedal. The feeling of the sound. The understanding of music theory. All these things are represented as different patterns and structures in the brain. And now that you have that thought in your mind, recognize that this beautiful pattern and structure of thought in the brain was not possible even just a couple hundred years ago. Because the piano was not invented until the year 1700. This beautiful pattern of thought in the brain didn't exist 5,000 years ago. And in this way, the skill of the piano, the relationship to the piano, the beauty that comes from it was not a thinkable thought until very, very recently in human history. And the invention of the piano itself was not an independent thought. It required a depth of mechanical engineering. It required the history of stringed instruments. It required so many patterns and structures of thought that led to the possibility of its invention and then the possibility of the mastery of its play. And it leads me to a concept I\\'d like to share with you guys, which I call \"The Palette of Being.\" Because all of us are born into this life having available to us the experiences of humanity that has come so far. We typically are only able to paint with the patterns of thoughts and the ways of being that existed before. So if the piano and the way of playing it is a way of being, this is a way of being that didn't exist for people 5,000 years ago. It was a color in the Palette of Being that you couldn't paint with. Nowadays if you are born, you can actually learn the skill; you can learn to be a computer scientist, another color that was not available just a couple hundred years ago. And our lives are really beautiful for the following reason. We're born into this life. We have the ability to go make this unique painting with the colors of being that are around us at the point of our birth. But in the process of life, we also have the unique opportunity to create a new color. And that might come from the invention of a new thing. A self-driving car. A piano. A computer. It might come from the way that you express yourself as a human being. It might come from a piece of artwork that you create. Each one of these ways of being, these things that we put out into the world through the creative process of mixing together all the other things that existed at the point that we were born, allow us to expand the Palette of Being for all of society after us. And this leads me to a very simple way to go frame everything that we've talked about today. Because I think a lot of us understand that we exist in this kind of the marvelous universe, but we think about this universe as we're this tiny, unimportant thing, there's this massive physical universe, and inside of it, there's the biosphere, and inside of that, that's society, and inside of us, we're just one person out of seven billion people, and how can we matter? And we think about this as like a container relationship, where all the goodness comes from the outside to the inside, and there's nothing really special about us. But the Palette of Being says the opposite. It says that the way that we are in our lives, the way that we affect our friends and our family, begin to change the way that they are able to paint in the future, begins to change the way that communities then affect society, the way that society could then affect its relationship to the biosphere, and the way that the biosphere could then affect the physical planet and the universe itself. And if it's a possible thing for cyanobacteria to completely transform the physical environment of our planet, it is absolutely a possible thing for us to do the same thing. And it leads to a really important question for the way that we're going to do that, the manner in which we're going to do that. Because we've been given this amazing gift of consciousness. And because of this gift, we have the ability to deeply understand our connectedness, in the way we haven't seen other animals having the opportunity to do so. And because we can deeply understand our connectedness, we're the ones that have the decision on how we're going to go use that knowledge, how we're going to go use it to build our societies and to shape our lives. I think the reason that all the spiritual traditions have got this concept of \"we are all connected inside of it\" is because the societies that actually deeply adopt this idea are the ones that over time deepen their level of consideration, deepen their level of expression, deepen their level of understanding for each other. This is the reason that this idea pops up over and over at the core of spiritual traditions. And I hope through this talk you see that the reason that it appears at the core of science is it's actually something that is just literally true of the physical universe at every single level of organization and every single manifestation of matter, energy, and life. So I'd like us all to come together with this knowledge and understand this truth about how the universe is, that because our hearts, our breath, and our mind are connected in this way, we need to challenge ourselves to understand what it means to live from this truth. Thank you. (Applause)", "TQMbvJNRpLE": "Translator: Phoon Bucgene Proofreader: Jenny Yang Raise your hand if you agree. Who believes that they can rely on only a pen and a piece of paper Reproduce this photo of Brad Pitt? Next I will tell you how to do it. at the same time, I will offer you to become a world-class artist Required skills. It takes less than 15 seconds to learn. But before that, Does anyone believe that he can reproduce this Pure gray grid? (laughter) Each of us can. If you can draw a gray grid, You can draw two, three, nine ... In fact, If you can draw a gray grid, You can hardly deny You have the ability to draw all the gray grids To reproduce this photo. It's that simple. I have taught you the most important skills to be a world-class artist. (laughter) I know what you are thinking. \"This is not real art, I certainly can\\'t make me a world-class artist. \" So let me introduce the artist Chuck Cross. For decades, he has been ranked as one of the most profitable artists in the world, And it is precisely this technique that he uses for artistic creation. So visible that we are with The difference between the most ambitious ideals we can achieve, It \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not how many magical skills and talents we have, But how do we understand the problem And make decisions to solve problems. And it is precisely because of what we face everyday This continuous and complex Billions of small decisions, Even if we make minor improvements in the process, The end result can also be very different. for example, Let's take a look at Novak Djokovic's career. In 2004, When he first became a professional tennis player, He ranks 680th in the world. Until about four years later, He successfully jumped to the third throne in the world. His annual salary increased from 250,000 to 5 million, This is just a game bonus, Of course his achievements stem from winning more games. By 2011, he was already the number one male tennis player in the world. Start earning an average of 14 million match prizes per year, And win 90% of the competitions. These beautiful data The best part is: Nowak has no way to control them. He can only control those small decisions, Make the right choice, In order to indirectly affect the probability of success, Let him achieve these achievements. And we can use the percentage of the score as a reference standard To quantify and monitor his progress. Because within the rules of tennis, Winning a point requires one to three small decisions, I want to call this his decision success rate. When he won 49% of the games, He also won a score of 49%. To be the third in the world, To use a racket Earn 5 million annual salary, He just needs to make the decision success rate Raised to 52%. If he wants to be more than just the number one in the world, And become the best tennis player in history, Then he only needs to make the decision success rate Increased to 55%. I always use the word \"only needed\". I don't mean to imply that this is an easy goal, Obviously it is not. But the slight improvement I said It's something that everyone here can do easily. Let me reveal the mystery: From kindergarten until high school graduation- Yes, that's how I graduated from high school\u00e2\u20ac\u201d (laughter) Every transcript says the same thing: \"Stephen is a very intelligent young man, If only he could calm down and concentrate. \" They didn't realize, I'm actually more eager to focus than they are, But I just can't do it. As a result, I went from kindergarten to sophomore, I'm all C, C- students. But when I entered the junior year, I've had enough. I want to make a change. I want to make minor adjustments, I choose not to be a viewer of choice anymore, Instead, become an active participant. So in that year, I no longer wonder I'll suddenly know it and be able to calm down Focus on more than 5 or 10 minutes, I decided to assume that I couldn't do it. So if I want to fulfill my wish-- Outstanding academic performance- I must change my approach. So I made a slight improvement. If I need to complete an assignment, for example, reading the five chapters of a textbook, I would not imagine it as five chapters, Don't even think of it as a chapter. I will break this homework into tasks that I can complete myself, And each task only requires me to focus on 5 to 10 minutes. It's about 3 to 4 paragraphs. that's it. When I completed that 5 to 10 minute mission, I will get up. I would go to play basketball, draw, Or playing video games for a few minutes, Then I will come back. Not necessarily returning to the same assignment, Even different subjects, But it's just another 5-10 minute assignment. from that time on, Until I graduate, I am an all-A student and will be on board every semester Dean's recognition list, principal's honor list. I enrolled in the world's top Finance and Economics Graduate Course. The same method, the same effect. Then I graduated. I started thinking after taking office, This method really worked for me. That is, taking these grand ideas, These complex ideas, these huge tasks, Broken down into smaller, more controllable tasks, at the same time, Make minor adjustments to the process To increase your chances of success. I want to apply this method to my career. So I did it. At first, I was a strange financial derivatives trader at Credit Suisse. Then I became Bank of America Global Head of Currency Options Trading, AIG's Global Emerging Markets Strategy Leader. This approach also allowed me to act as a global macro hedge fund manager, Helped me achieve the top return on investment in twelve years, He became the founder and chief information officer of two award-winning hedge funds. By 2001, I can't help thinking, this method Let me do well in school, Let me develop better in my career, Why don't I apply this method to my personal life, As I have achieved my career goals in this way? One day, I walked to work, My commute during that time was Walk from one end of Hyde Park to the other. It took me 45 minutes one way, Equivalent to one and a half hours a day, 7 and a half hours a week, 30 hours a month, 360 hours a year, Basically, I wasted this time in awake, Listen to music on my iPod. So when I came home one day, I went to a store. I purchased the first 33 CDs of the German Course \"Pimsleur Series\", Rip them into my iPod. And I didn't stop there. Because, the fact is that I am not a self-disciplined person. I know after a while, I would choose to give up studying and continue listening to music. So, in order not to be tempted, I uninstalled all the music. There is only one option left for me: Listen to language lessons. Ten months later, I finished listening to all 99 CDs. German language tutorial, I heard each one three times. Then I went to Berlin for a 16-day intensive German course. After the course, I invited my wife and children to meet me in Berlin. We strolled around the city. I speak to locals in German and they respond to me in German. My children are stunned. (laughter) They were so shocked they couldn't even close their mouths. But you and I know, Everything I just did is not a little bit remarkable. I made a slight adjustment in my daily routine. Subtle improvements were made throughout the process. (German) Und jetzt, ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch. Now I can speak German. At that moment, I thought: This shouldn't be so easy--especially for an elderly person like me-- So quickly learned a new language. This should be something that children can do. And I can do it now. It is precisely this slight adjustment. So is there anything else for me Established after retirement, But is it possible to achieve the ambitious goal now? Maybe I can make a slight adjustment to my daily routine. So I started to act. I got a racing license, I learned how to fly a helicopter, Going to learn rock climbing and skydiving. I learned to fly. If you are like me, in 2007, You may have the same goals as me. I just returned from London. At that time, I was about 25 pounds overweight and totally out of shape. I want to change all this. I can use ordinary methods, For example, write a check to a gym I can't go to. Or I can swear to God I will not eat those I love again, But food harmful to the body. It is clear to me that the possibility of implementing this common method is very low. So I decided to become an active participant. I analyze the habits that form in my life. I think if I can make minor adjustments to them, Can they, in turn, become good for me? So I started to act. I have a habit, For seven years, I have spent an hour and a half walking every day, I have a strong passion for the outdoors. At that year, I did n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a \"New Year\\'s wish to lose 25 pounds\", Instead, I set up one and walked 33 Mountain climbing target on a hiking path in the Santa Barbara mountains. I had never climbed a mountain before. (laughter) But the fact is, the focus is not on those 33 hiking trails. You have to take this huge goal Break down into decisions that are acceptable to them-- In the process we make the right decision To increase our chances of success. The focus is not on every avenue, It's every small decision. When we sit at the desk, Try to squeeze some time before the end of the day. Or we lie on the sofa, Press the remote control to see different channels. Or reading information on Facebook, At that moment, decisions need to be made and set aside. Put on your mountaineering suit, Go out the door and leave everything behind Step into the car, start, and drive to the beginning of the trail. Get out of the car, Take the first step, take the second and third steps, Every step I just said, Need to make small, right choices In order to achieve the ultimate result. Every time, when I say I want to climb 33 paths, People think of the decisions I made on the top of the mountain. And that's not the point. Because if you lie on the sofa Didn't make the right decision, Well, there is no chance to make a decision on the mountaintop. That's it, at the end of that year, I climbed 33 paths, Even each path climbed several times. I even climbed several paths in the mountains. I lost 25 pounds. At the end of that year, I completed the most difficult half marathon in the world- Pier to Peak. In 2009, I set my goals very high. For a person who can't be quiet until now, It \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very ambitious for people who ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gather the center god for more than 10 minutes, That's reading 50 books. But again, the focus is still not on reading 50 books, Nor reading a book, Not even reading a chapter, a section, or a sentence. But before our day is over That decision made at the desk. Or lying on the sofa, When browsing information on Facebook, We put the phone down. Pick up a book and read the last word. If we could read the last word, we would read two words and three words; Will continue to read the last sentence, one section, one page, one chapter, one book; We will read 10, 30, 50 books. I set my goals even higher in 2012. I set 24 new year wishes. 12 of them are what I call \"generous wishes\", I need to complete 12 charitable deeds that do not involve money. But some of them failed. I try to donate blood, But it was rejected because I live in the UK. I tried to donate sperm and was rejected by the authorities because I was too old. I try to donate my hair, Only to find out that no one wants to have gray hair. (laughter) In the meantime, I try to do good deeds and make myself feel good, But only the opposite effect. In addition, I set 12 learning goals. Learn 12 skills. When I learned to ride a unicycle, parkour, take a soft rope, On stilts and drums, My wife suggested that I study knitting. (laughter) Honestly, I have no interest in knitting at all. But one day, when I was sitting under a 12-meter-high eucalyptus tree, \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dIt's 2.6 miles above the cold trail on the Santa Barbara Cold Stream, I think if this tree is wrapped in cotton yarn, it must be very cool! (laughter) Then I went home and searched, Someone did such a thing, it was called-Cotton Bomb: Wrap public buildings with cotton yarn. Coincidentally, the second World Cotton Yarn Bomb Day Just after 82 days. (laughter) That's it, in those 82 days, no matter where I am-- (laughter) In the conference room, on the exchange, On a plane, or in a hospital, I'm all practicing knitting. Repeatedly practice one stitch at a time. After 82 days, I completed the first cotton bomb in my life. (applause) The subsequent response really calmed me down. So I decided to keep going-- (laughter) Applied more engineering skills, To complete larger and more ambitious projects. In 2014, I set goals, Wrap six boulder rocks in the mountains of Los Padres National Forest. However, if I really want to accomplish my goal, I need help from others. At that time, I already had thousands of fans on social media, A fan of Cotton Bomber. (laughter) I started receiving parcels, lots of parcels-- 388 donors from 36 different countries, including all 50 states. Later, I wrapped more than one boulder, A total of 18 pieces were included. (applause) So I kept on working hard, A larger and more ambitious project was carried out. I also need to use more new materials, Such as fiberglass, wood, metal, etc. Finally integrated a project here at Tucson Hospital, I wrapped the Tucson Infant Hospital. (applause) After that, I stopped knitting. I didn't really like it. (laughter) but... I like crochet. (laughter) So, I made some 7-inch old grandmother square weaves\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Because this is the standard square weave size- In the process. I can't help wondering, why should I stop at 7 inches? I want a big one. So I started making bigger old grandma square weaves. One day after I went home on a business trip, I took this big square weaving, Visit the Guinness Book of Records page. I'm curious how big the oldest grandmother cube in the world is. It turned out that Guinness did not have this category. (laughter) So I went to apply, Then they rejected me. I appeal, They rejected me again. I appeal again and they say, okay. If you can make it 10 meters square, we will open a new category, And you can become the new Guinness World Record holder. That's it, for the next 2 years, 7 months, 17 days, One stitch at a time, I finally sewed more than half a million stitches, Used more than 30 miles of cotton yarn. And now i'm the biggest crochet in the world The official Guinness World Record holder for Old Grandmother Boxer. (Applause) (Cheers) My self-entertainment has attracted the attention of countless people all the way. I was published in Newsweek Magazine, There is also Eric News, a special issue of the artist. However, when you hear these achievements, I hope you understand: I'm still a C- student. I'm still the one who can't calm down, Focus on children over 5 or 10 minutes, Still the one without special talents or skills. I just put very big, grand plans, Plans that others find incredible, Broken down into the smallest items, And make minor improvements in the process To increase the chance of success. And the reason I gave this speech, I hope to inspire you Realize your grand dreams with action, No longer talking on paper, Make minor improvements in daily behavior and start practicing your dreams. Thank you! (applause)", "QeHGDr81XwM": "Hello friends in this video I will show you how to heat up a camping tent with a Finnish-style log stove also known as a Finnish log torch there are several methods to heating up a camping tent without a portable metal stove you can set up a long log gap fire outside the tent just close enough so that the heat would radiate through the tent wall also you can heat up a large rock and bring it inside the tent you can easily find a large rock in the root ball of a falling tree even in a snowy forest but this video will demonstrate how to heat up a camping tent using a stream of warm air from a metal pipe running through a Finnish log torch I have already tried this method using traditional campfire but was not happy with the results this time I'm using a Finnish torch with a curved pipe as a modification to the prior method I should say upfront that I was pleasantly surprised how well the tent heating method worked this time first of all we will need a metal pipe for our experiment I used the curved steel pipe from the headrest of a vintage metal bed the headrest was rusty so it took me some time and effort to disassemble it into parts and clean them both outside and inside okay now we have all we need to conduct the tent heating experiment in the snowy forest a pipe thermometer and wood I stashed a few dry segments of a fallen fir tree last summer so we could save time on cutting it now I left the wood segments wedged and suspended in the original log so they could stay dry now we need to make a Finnish log torch the log torch unlike the Finnish log candle keeps all the fire inside the wood segment it burns slower and more economically to maximize the economy and duration of heating are the two characteristics I want to achieve in this project there are many ways you can make a log torch but I'll use the easiest one it is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit -12 Celsius outside and all the moisture in the wood freezes so it becomes fairly easy to chop wet wood as the frozen moisture swells the log from inside however my log segments are dry because they were kept suspended above the ground so it isn't that easy to chop them without a wedge to make a log torch tent heater you need to chop a segment of wood into three or four large pieces and remove the cool portion of each piece just enough so that you could loosely feed the pipe inside the formed channel because I was chopping wood for two log torches (for two experiments) I got warm real quick my trusted Billinas #9 Finnish axe rose to the challenge I think it is one of the best multi-purpose axes out there I even used it to build my log cabin at Ladoga Lake traditionally you would reinforce a Finnish log torch with viza a rope made from fir branch I will leave a link to my video about how to make such bushcraft rope below this time however I will use my homemade clamper and steel wire as it is a lot faster time is valuable in the northern winter forest because the day is short and I need to assemble two log torches and my tent before dark the reason I need two log torches is because I need to test two metal pipe shapes a single-bent pipe and a u-shaped pipe we will try a u-shaped steel pipe experiment first obviously we would have to insert the U-shaped pipe into the torch's triangular opening before clamping the torch assembly once I added legs to this log torch it became heavier but it is still fairly mobile I can easily pick it up by its legs and carry it to the tent in order to heat up a tent, well, we need a tent)))  this means it is time to set up my tried and tested tent model UP5 it is a spacious camping tent for five people almost a small studio apartment with no pesky neighbors and a great location however it won't be easy to heat up such a large space which makes the experiment even more interesting and trustworthy my double wall russian-made tent has an umbrella-like frame that allows you to set it up quickly now it is time to fire up our log torch as I said earlier I nailed three legs to each log torch for better air flow and stability next I cleared a small spot from snow so that the log torch wouldn't fall on the tent once the snow melts under it I didn't have a shovel so I just stomped and pushed the snow aside with my legs I was glad I had my custom tailored gaiters on they prevented snow from getting into my shoes and getting my feet wet I will leave a link to the gaiter template below in case you're interested as you can see I nailed the legs with their longer portions at the bottom and checked the torch assembly with my weight however I decided to install the torch upside down to use its longer leg as a pipe support this way the metal pipe will be suspended in the air and it will not press on snow under the torch or the torch's inner burning part I made a V-cut on the tip of a former leg and now the heating pipe is well secured you can also use two nails to secure it if you don't have a sword to make a V-cut the easiest way to start our log torch is to plug the central hole at the bottom with a piece of bark then stuff it with dry branches and wood chips it only takes one match to start the fire then I didn't do a great job chopping and reassembling the log segment into a torch with no radial gaps this means the fire will eat up the torch faster through those gaps which is why I put some snow in them to prolong the torch's life once the log torch reaches its cruising temperature you won't see any flames outside the torch's walls inside will slowly burn which in turn will heat the fresh air inside the pipe that is flowing up to the tent note the fresh air gets into the pipe below the level of the log torch preventing any carbon monoxide from mixing into it it is freezing outside and the long aluminum pipe cools off quickly if the first pipe segment is too hot to touch the second segment that is closer to the tent is noticeably cooler to improve the torch's efficiency I decided to move it closer to the tent and this is where I made a mistake I didn't push the legs all the way to the ground and I faced the consequences later my tent has two entrances so I could use one door to run the heating pipe through and use the other one for all other needs note I'm not forcing the airflow in any way yet the airflow is significant I'm using a small feather to demonstrate it admittedly my tent is large and it will take at least an hour to heat the top through such a small diameter pipe without supercharging this is why it's still freezing inside the tent but I make it to wait to see if this tent heating method works so I decided to take a short nap in my cozy sleeping bag I was napping for at least an hour and a half before I got out of the sleeping bag to measure the air temperature the air got really warm inside the tent even though I forgot to close a small chimney hatch which means it would have been even warmer inside once I put my shoes on and looked outside I saw that the log torch fell on its side because I forgot to push its legs all the way to the ground the log torch melted snow and evenly which caused it to topple I'm glad I didn't put the torch too close to the tent as it would have burned a hole in the wall even though the toppled log torch could have still worked longer I couldn't wait to test a single-bend-pipe design of this method so I prepared and fired up my second torch to save time I used the same legs with nails but this time I used my clamper to reinforce the log torch over the legs as well which pulled the log pieces together even tighter resulting in smaller gaps between them thus resulted in longer burning time also thanks to the additional metal wire clamps the torch ended up being extra strong I got a little carried away jumping on it to demonstrate its durability ))) I think I might adopt this simple idea of just clamping parts together with steel wire to make primitive log furniture for my cabin I hammered two nailes at the bottom opening to prevent small branches from falling through it it was easier and faster to start the fire without a U-shaped pipe sticking from the opening another advantage is you can easily move a burning torch from one place to another something you couldn't really do with a burning campfire this is why I decided I like the single-bent pipe method better because the U-shaped pipe cannot be removed from the burning torch if needed it is 10 degrees Fahrenheit -11 Celsius now the efficiency of such a log heater depends greatly on the temperature gradient in other words the greater the temperature difference inside and outside the tent the better the air flow will be I reached 57 degrees +14 Celsius inside and that is considering I didn't call the second door fully so there is a 47 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Celsius temperature gradient to be honest I didn't expect such an impressive result I would dare to suggest you can reach tropical temperature values in a small tent the temperature of the air coming out from the pipe is definitely higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit degree +60 Celsius unfortunately my thermometer scale maxes out at 140 Fahrenheit +60 degrees Celsius here are a few words about the methods safety firstly there is no fire inside the tent secondly there is a constant fresh air flow coming into the tent you are totally protected against carbon monoxide poisoning because the pipe gets the fresh cold air below the level of the burning log torch also a log stove can be used for cooking food even while it's heating up your tent I personally like the single-bent pipe modification of the method better you can put the pipe in or take it out at any time which makes it easier to start the fire to cook certain dishes or to carry a burning log torch to another location however the U-shaped pipe scheme gets the fresh air from the side and if a small burning ember falls through the torch you won't smell any smoke inside the tent from my experience even if that happens you can barely smell any smoke inside the tent so my conclusion is this it was an interesting experience and successful experiment it is labor consuming but safe and effective besides carrying three short metal pipes is a lot easier than carrying a portable metal stove while traveling in the snowy wilderness I think this method can be further improved if you have any thoughts how you can make it even more efficient please write it below I would love to hear your suggestions lastly if you extinguish a locked torch a little before it is fully burned you can get yourself an unusual piece of primitive furniture I haven't quite figured out how I could use it let me know if you have any idea what can be done with it the log torch idea has a lot of other practical applications for example I recently published a video about an original bushcraft dish that I called a vertical shish kebab it is a skewered spiral potato with a hot dog inside I have grilled the dish on the campfire many times and always found it delicious however the vertical cooking method has its advantages firstly you don't have to rotate the skewer yet the dish cooks quicker and more evenly secondly skewered dishes cooked in the vertical stove taste better than kebabs cooked on traditional grills regular kebabs drip fat on the coals causing it to taste and smells slightly burned while kebab dishes cooked in vertical stoves do not drip fat on fire but rather self -basting which enhances their own taste when I cooked my skewered spiraled potato dish the seasoning fat ran down the potato as it cooked basting it with meaty taste I don't think I can go back to traditional horizontal grilling a more detailed instruction on how to make a vertical stove and prepare food in it can be seen on my video: Swedish Torch/ Stove Vertical Cooking / My Bushcraft Recipes the link is below if you liked this video perhaps you could share it with your friends let good people watch

Find out that I'm visiting the largest collection of these balls anywhere on Earth in the Los Angeles Reservoir 96 million shadow balls. It is true. 96 million is very rare to see 96 million of anything This is your life jacket that you must wear. OK. Throw your leg and climb in any case you can Here you are. thank you Looking at this I had a lot of questions. Like why are blacks? Is it safe in drinking water? how much do they cost? Does it actually reduce evaporation? What is their real goal? Is it difficult to drive in shadow balls? very Difficult. why is that? These are already partially filled with water and the reason why it is filled with water is because in Los Angeles tank we have some really high winds So if we don't put water in these things, there will be balls that bounce off the five highways people will leave, and they will be everywhere. These keep the balls in the tank, and if they start rolling, they are swaying because the water makes them uneven But this makes it difficult for them to get away from the road, especially when they form structures like crystal Behind the boat, the balls quickly meet up with our soles Some are pulled close to the engine along with the boat Gorgeous Is what you think about the first time they suggested doing this or when it first appeared Yes there was a little. Do you think they were nuts? No, not nuts It's just like. It seems silly It feels like we are in the largest ball pit in the world Yeah right, that's what it looks like you can't say by standing here that we're really flying I think it's likely 40 40 feet here, and 40 feet deep below us You cannot even see any water I thought it was a joke. right? If you do not know. It will be like no, you are not like a green screen or something good, yes it is fake Like when I turn on the faucet at home, does the water come from here? Yes really. Sometimes, or always. most of the time Most of the time the water comes from here, and the nuts are completely So why is the LA tank covered in shadow balls? The problem all started with bromide Bromide is a naturally occurring substance associated with salt water Typically, places like the California Channel descend from the Delta You get some salt water intake and we have some bromide in the water Bromide is harmless and almost impossible to remove And when you disinfect water with ozone, this bromide becomes bromate And bromate is carcinogenic Around the year 2000, they wrote regulations regulating bromate The regulations essentially state if you have an ozone treatment plant Then you have to watch the bromate to be careful not to shape too much So the only place we measured bromine was in our filtration plant The results were always within 10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators So they were confused when they got a call from one of their clients the Los Angeles Beverage Company They said we have some really high levels of bromate showing. Are you aware of this? We said well that we are not showing anything But between the filter station and the client was the tank So they did some tests Almost upon reaching this open tank, bromate levels jumped This bromide has been transformed with chlorine, which is supposed to be safe in bright sunlight, which forms more bromate than ozone. Thus we made this unfortunate scientific discovery that was not actually part of any organizational chart And here we are in the tank We have a water source containing harmful bromide We have chlorine, we must have clean water, we have sunlight because it is open The only option we have is to remove sunlight So we looked at all kinds of things We looked at the floating fabrics across the water We usually put a floating cap on the water but this is a multi-year project And we said we can't manufacture some kind of trampoline with poly like PVC pipes They will just become birds, and you will face a major water quality problem Thus we knew that we have high density polyethylene pipes which are used in the water industry We know they float and we thought at some point, could we float a pile of tubes across the surface Well it's hard to do and very expensive because it contains a lot of material So maybe we could take some tubes and run them through a cutting machine, and we could create a wreck field on the roof Like the back corner of the lake somewhere But anyway all this warm water is soft with plastic floating on top which looks like a petri dish And here is Dr. Brian White doing some research and finding the shadow ball However, they were not called shadow balls at that time This product exists and they are called bird balls They used it in ponds that contain mine remains where they did not want to enter waterfowl and poisoning Also around the airports with docks and they wanted to keep waterfowl so they would not get off and get into jet engines", "hUhisi2FBuw": "Every year nearly a half trillion of these cans are manufactured\u2014that\u2019s about 15,000 per second \u2014 so many that we overlook the can\u2019s superb engineering. Let\u2019s start with why the can is shaped like it is. Why a cylinder? An engineer might like to make a spherical can: it has the smallest surface area for a given volume and so it uses the least amount of material. And it also has no corners and so no weak points because the pressure in the can uniformly stresses the walls. But a sphere is not practical to manufacture. And, of course, it\u2019ll roll off the table. Also, when packed as closely as possible only 74% of the total volume is taken up by the product. The other 26% is void space, which goes unused when transporting the cans or in a store display. An engineer could solve this problem by making a cuboid-shaped can. It sits on a table, but it\u2019s uncomfortable to hold and awkward to drink from. And while easier to manufacture than a sphere, these edges are weak points and require very thick walls. But the cuboid surpasses the sphere in packing efficiently: it has almost no wasted space, although at the sacrifice of using more surface area to contain the same volume as the sphere. So, to create a can engineers use a cylinder, which has elements of both shapes. From the top, it\u2019s like a sphere, and from the side, it\u2019s like a cuboid .A cylinder has a maximum packing factor of about 91% -- not as good as the cuboid, but better than the sphere. Most important of all: the cylinder can be rapidly manufactured. The can begins as this disk \u2014called a \u201cblank\u201d\u2014 punched from an aluminum sheet about three-tenths of a mm thick. The first step starts with a \u201cdrawing die,\u201d on which sits the blank and then a \u201cblank holder\u201d that rests on top. We\u2019ll look at a slice of the die so we can see what\u2019s happening. A cylindrical punch presses down on the die, forming the blank into a cup. This process is called \u201cdrawing.\u201d This cup is about 88 mm in diameter\u2014larger than the final can \u2014 so it\u2019s re-drawn. That process starts with this wide cup, and uses another cylindrical punch, and a \u201credrawing die.\u201d The punch presses the cup through the redrawing die and transforms it into a cup with a narrower diameter, which is a bit taller. This redrawn cup is now the final diameter of the can\u201465 mm\u2014but it\u2019s not yet tall enough. A punch pushes this redrawn cup through an ironing ring. The cup stays the same diameter, as it becomes taller and the walls thinner. If we watch this process again up close, you see the initial thick wall, and then the thinner wall after it\u2019s ironed. Ironing occurs in three stages, each progressively making the walls thinner and the can taller. After the cup is ironed, the dome on the bottom is formed. This requires a convex doming tool and a punch with a matching concave indentation. As the punch presses the cup downward onto the doming tool: the cup bottom then deforms into a dome. That dome reduces the amount of metal needed to manufacture the can. The dome bottom  uses less material than if the bottom were flat. A dome is an arch, revolved around its center. The curvature of the arch distributes some of the vertical load into horizontal forces, allowing a dome to withstand greater pressure than a flat beam. On the dome you might notice two large numbers. These debossed numbers are engraved on the doming tool. The first number signifies the production line in the factory, and the second number signifies the bodymaker number -- the bodymaker is the machine that performs the redrawing, ironing and doming processes. These numbers help troubleshoot production problems in the factory. In that factory the manufacturing of a can takes place at a tremendous rate: these last three steps\u2014 re-drawing, ironing and doming\u2014all happen in one continuous stroke and in only a seventh of a second. The punch moves at a maximum velocity of 11 meters per second and experiences a maximum acceleration of 45 Gs. This process runs continuously for 6 months or around 100 million cycles before the machine needs servicing. Now, if you look closely at the top of the can body, you see that the edges are wavy and uneven. These irregularities occur during the forming. To get a nice even edge, about 6 mm is trimmed off of the top. With an even top the can can now be sealed. But before that sealing occurs a colorful design is printed on the outside\u2014the term of art in the industry is \u201cdecoration.\u201d The inside also gets a treatment: a spray-coated epoxy lacquer separates the can\u2019s contents from its aluminum walls. This prevents the drink from acquiring a metallic taste, and also keeps acids in the beverage from dissolving the aluminium. The next step forms the can\u2019s neck \u2014 the part of the can body that tapers inward. This \u201cnecking\u201d requires eleven-stages. The forming starts with a straight-walled can. The top is brought slightly inward. And then this is repeated further up the can wall until the final diameter is reached. The change in neck size at each stage is so subtle that you can barely tell a difference between one stage and the next. Each one of these stages works by inserting an inner die into the can body, then pushing an outer die\u2014called the necking sleeve\u2014around the outside. The necking sleeve retracts, the inner die retracts, and the can moves to the next stage. The necking is drawn out over many different stages to prevent wrinkling, or pleating, of the thin aluminum. Since the 1960\u2019s, the diameter of the can end has become smaller by 6 mm \u2014 from 60 mm to 54 mm today. This seems a tiny amount, but the aluminum can industry produces over 100 billion cans a year, so that 6 mm reduction saves at least 90 million kilograms of aluminum annually. That amount would form a solid cube of aluminum 32 meters on a side\u2014compare that to a 787 dreamliner with a 60 meter wingspan. Now, after the neck has been formed the top is flanged; that is, it flares out slightly and allows the end to be secured to the body, which brings us to the next brilliant design feature: the double seam. On older steel cans manufactures welded or soldered on the ends. This often contaminated the can\u2019s contents. In contrast, today\u2019s cans use a hygienic \u201cdouble seam,\u201d which can also be made faster. This can is cut in half so you can see the cross-section of the double seam. To create this seam, a machine uses two basic operations. The first curls the end of the can cover around the flange of the can body. The second operation presses the folds of metal together to form an air-tight seal. While the operations themselves are simple, they require high precision. Parts misaligned by a small fraction of a millimeter cause the seam to fail. In addition to the clamping of the end and can body, a sealing compound ensures that no gas escapes through the double seam. The compound is applied as a liquid, then hardens to a form a gasket. The end, attached immediately after the cans is filled, traps gases inside the can to create pressures of about 30 psi or 2 times atmospheric pressure. In soda, carbon dioxide produces the pressure; in non-carbonated drinks, like juices, nitrogen is added. So why is a beverage can pressurized? Because the internal pressure creates a strong can despite its thin walls. Squeeze a closed, pressurized can\u2014it barely gives. Then squeeze an empty can\u2014it flexes easily. The cans walls are thin\u2014only 75 microns thick\u2014and they are flimsy, but the internal pressure of a sealed can pushes outwards equally, and so keeps the wall in tension. This tension is key: the thin wall acts like a chain \u2014 in compression it has no strength, but in tension it\u2019s very strong. The internal pressure strengthens the cans so that they can be safely stacked \u2014a pressurized can easily supports the weight of an average human adult. It also adds enough strength so that the can doesn\u2019t need the corrugations like in this unpressurized steel food can. While initially pressurized to about 2 atmospheres, a can may experience up to 4 atmospheres of internal pressure in its lifetime due to elevated temperatures; and so the can is designed to withstand up to 6 atmospheres or 90 psi before the dome or the end will buckle. Why is there a tab on the end of the can? It seems a silly question\u2014how else would you open it? But originally cans didn\u2019t have tabs. Very early steel cans were called flat tops, for pretty obvious reasons. You use a special opener to puncture a hole to drink from, and a hole to vent. In the 1960\u2019s, the pull-tab was invented so that no opener was needed. The tab worked like this: you lift up this ring to vent the can, and pull the tab to create the opening. Easy enough, but now you\u2019ve got this loose tab. The cans ask you to \u201cPlease don\u2019t litter\u201d but sadly, these pull tabs got tossed on the ground, where the sharp edges of the tabs cut the barefeet of beachgoers\u2014or they harmed wildlife. So, the beverage can industry responded by inventing the modern stay-on tab. This little tab involved clever engineering. The tab starts as a second class lever; this is like a wheelbarrow because tip of the tap is the fulcrum and the rivet the load \u2014 the effort is being applied on the end. But here\u2019s the genius part: the moment the can vents the tab switches to a first class lever which is like a seesaw: where the load is now at the tip and the fulcrum is the rivet. You can see clearly how the tab, when working as a wheelbarrow, lifts the rivet. In fact, part of the reason this clever design works is because the pressure inside the can helps to force the rivet up, which in turn depresses the outer edge of the top until it vents the can and then the tab changes to a seesaw lever. Looking from the inside of the can, you can see how the tab first opens near the rivet. If you tried to simply force the scored metal section into the can using the tab as a first class lever with the rivet as the fulcrum throughout you'd be fighting the pressure inside the can: the tab would be enormous, and expensive. If you\u2019d like to learn more about the entire lifecycle of the aluminum can, watch this animated video by Rexam that describes can manufacturing and recycling. A typical aluminum can today contains about 70% recycled material. Also, Discovery\u2019s How It\u2019s Made has some great footage of the manufacturing machinery. Here are two different stepwise animations of the entire can forming process. And lastly, these are two detailed animations of the cup drawing and redrawing processes. The aluminum beverage can is so ubiquitous that it\u2019s easy to take for granted. But the next time you take a sip from one, consider the decades of ingenious design required to create this modern engineering marvel. I\u2019m Bill Hammack, the engineer guy.

Thanks again.", "zORUUqJd81M": "Translator: Mujtaba Al-Helu Auditor: Muhammad Ramadan Why does the universe exist? Why is there - all right well. (Laughter) This is a universal puzzle. Be serious. Why is there a world, and why are we in it, Why is there something instead of nothing? I mean \"why\" is the eternal question So I will talk about the mystery of existence, The mystery of existence, Where we now treat it, And why should you pay attention, I hope you take care. Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that Those who are not wondering about the chance of their existence, About the coincidence of the existence of the world, They suffer from a mental deficiency. This is a little harsh, but true. (Laughter) So this has been known as the highest question The coolest puzzle, The deepest and most difficult to ask A person can imagine. It caused the obsession of great thinkers. Perhaps Ludwig and Liechtenstein is the greatest Philosopher of the twentieth century He was originally astonished by the existence of the world. He mentioned in his book \"Theses\" suggestion 4.66, \"The question is not how the world exists That is Sufism, But the question is at the root of existence. \" And if you do not like to take your mockery From a philosopher, try a scientist. John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists In the twentieth century, He is Professor Richard Feynman, The inventor of the term \"black hole,\" He said, \"I want to know How was the quantum found, How was the universe found, and how did existence exist? \" And my friend Martin Ames - I apologize, I will tell you many names in this hadith, So they got used to it - My dear friend Martin Ames once said We need five people like Einstein to answer On the riddle of where the universe came from. And I do not suspect that there are five people like Einstein In this audience tonight. Is there Einstein? Raise your hand? Both? There is no Einstein? OK. So this question, why is there something instead of nothing, This fundamental question was asked late Somewhat of an intellectual history. It was off the end of the seventeenth century, The philosopher Leibniz asked him, A very smart person, Leibniz, Who invented the calculus Independently of Isaac Newton in the same period, But for Ebentz, who asked why being, not nothingness, This was not a great secret. Has been or pretended to be A Christian is religious in his external metaphysical appearance, He said it was clear why the world existed: Because God created him. Indeed, God created from nothing at all. This is how God is capable. It does not need raw materials in advance to create this world. He can create from nothingness. Created out of nowhere. And by the way, that's what Most Americans believe in it today. There is no mystery to exist for them. God created him. So let's put this into an equation. I don't have any slides so I'm just going to make my own visuals, So use your imagination. So God + nothing = the world. Exactly? This is the equation. Thus you may not be a believer in God. You may be an atheist world Or an atheist, unscientific, and you don't believe in God, I am not happy with this. By the way, even if we have this equation, God + nothingness = the world, There is already a problem: Why is there God ?? God does not exist by logic alone Unless you believe in existential controversy, I hope you are not, because it is a good argument. So it is possible to imagine, if God were in existence, You may wonder, I am eternal, and I am capable, But where did you come from? (Laughter) Where am I then from? God speaks more formal English. (Laughter) There is a theory that God was weary From contemplating the mystery of his existence So he created the world just to occupy himself. After all, let's forget God. Let's get God out of the equation: We have \u00d9\u20ac\u00d9\u20ac\u00d9\u20ac\u00d9\u20ac + nothingness = the world. Now, if you were a Buddhist, You might really want to stop here, Because basically what you got is Nothingness = the world, And in the event that the identity matches, that means The world = nothingness. Exactly? For a Buddhist, the world is just too much of a thing. It is just a huge cosmic void. And we think there is so much But it is because our desires enslave us. If we let our desires melt away, We will see the world for what it really is, Emptiness, nothingness, And we will slip into a state of utmost happiness Which is defined as your possession only Enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter) So, this is Buddhist thought. But I am Western, and I'm still interested The riddle of existence, so I have + + \u00d9\u20ac\u00d9\u20ac\u00d9\u20ac It'll get serious soon, so _ + + Nothingness = the world. What will we put in that void? Well what about science? Science is our best guide to the nature of reality. Physics is the most basic science. Where it tells us what is really abstract, It reveals what he called (AMHK) The ultimate and true tool of the universe. So physics might be able to fill this void, And actually, since the late 1960's or around the 1970's, Physicists have claimed that they have A purely scientific explanation of how That a universe like ours has come into being From absolute nothingness, Quantum fluctuation of emptiness. One of these scientists is Stephen Hawking, And recently, Alex Feliken, The whole matter was circulated By a physicist and a personal friend of mine, Lawrence Krause, who wrote a book named \"Be lack of\" Lawrence believes that - He is a hardliner atheist, by the way, So God removed from the image - Quantum field theory laws, The finest theories of physics, you can show how For sheer lack, Where there is no space, no time, and nothing, Few false solid nugget Can be transformed into an entity, Then, by the miracle of inflation, It explodes to create this huge diverse universe That we see around us. Well, this is really an innovative scenario. Very meditative and attractive. But it created a huge problem for me, This problem is: It is a semi-religious destination. Now, Lawrence thinks himself an atheist, But he is still in the bondage of religious outlook. He sees physical laws as divine commands. Laws of quantum field theory for him It is not negotiable as a verse in the Bible. Laws have a kind of influence and existential power Which can form pre-creation latex, Which is pregnant with existence. You can create from scratch. But this is a very rudimentary view of interpretation Physical law, right? We know that physical laws are actually General explanations of natural patterns and systems in this world. It does not exist outside this world. It does not exist on its own. These laws cannot To create existence out of nowhere. It is a very basic look For the interpretation of a scientific law. And if you don't believe me on this, Listen to Stephen Hawking, Who personally modeled a universe Independent of himself, No need for an external cause, or a creator, After assuming this, Hawking admitted that he was still at a loss. He said, this model is just equations. What blows the soul in these equations And creates a world for them to be described? This confused him. So the equations themselves can't do magic, You cannot solve the mystery of existence. Besides, even if laws can do that, Why this set of laws? Why the quantum field theory that describes The universe has a specified number of forces Particles, etc.? Why isn't there a completely different set of laws? There are many, many combinations of related math laws. Why are there laws at all? Why is there absolute nothingness? So this is a problem, believe it or not, Reflects that physicists really think a lot about it, At this point they tend to metaphysics, They say, well, maybe the set of laws That describes our universe, Just one set of laws She explains one side of the truth, But perhaps each set of laws is interlinked It describes another part of the truth, And in fact all possible physical worlds Really there, all from there. We see only a small portion of reality Explained by the laws of the quantum field theory, But there are many other worlds, And parts of reality I described Significantly different theories Which is different from our theories in an unimaginable way, That's incredibly strange. Stephen Weinberg, Abu The standard model of particle physics, He might actually deal with this idea, There are all possible facts. Also, Max Tejmark, the youngest physicist, Who believes that all mathematical structures exist, And mathematical presence is the same Like a physical presence, So we have this vastly rich multiverse Which includes every logical possibility. Now, by taking this metaphysical method, These physicists and philosophers also return The idea is actually quite old Attributed to Plato. Which is the principle of abundance or fertility, Or the great chain of existence, This reality is actually as complete as possible. Removed from nothing It could be. So we now have these two extremes. We have absolute nothingness on the one hand, We have this view of existence That encompasses all the imaginable world On the opposite side: the maximum possible reality, Nothingness, the slightest possible reality. Now what is between these two extremes? There are all kinds of intermediate facts That includes some things and other leaves. So one of these intermediate facts It is, for example, the most refined sporting reality, This leaves the less subtle particles, Ugly inconsistencies, etc. Now, some physicists will tell you In fact, we live in the most sophisticated reality. I think Brian Green is in the audience, He has authored a book called \"The Elite Universe.\" He claims that the universe we live in Very sporty. Do not believe him. (Laughter) It is pious hope, I wish it was true, But I think the next day he recognized me The universe is really ugly. Stupidly constructed, I got a lot of arbitrary coupling constants And group ratios And unnecessary families of elementary particles, What is that dark energy? It's an odd stick and chewing gum. It is not an elite universe. (Laughter) Then there are the best of all possible worlds In the moral sense. You must be serious now Because a world with living things Don't suffer unnecessarily, There are no things like it Children's cancer and genocide. This is the moral concept. Anyway, between nowhere The most extreme reality possible, Various exceptional worlds. The nothingness is exceptional. It is the simplest. Then there is the most sophisticated possible reality. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exceptional. The most extreme reality possible, that's exceptional. But what do we leave here? There are also only facts Petty public. Those are not exceptional in any way, That's a random group. It is infinitely devoid of nothing, But it does not amount unlimited to complete perfection. It is a mixture of chaos and order, Of sporty sophistication and ugliness. So I would like to describe these facts They are endless, intermediate, and incomplete chaos, General reality, and a kind of unwanted cosmic footage. And these facts, Is there a god in any of these facts? Perhaps, but this deity is not perfect Like the Christian-Jewish deity. This deity is not the Almighty, the Optimized. It may even be 100 percent spiteful But only 80 percent influential, That pretty much describes the world that we see around us, I think. (Laughter). So I would suggest the solution To conundrum exist That the reality that we find One of those general facts. Reality must transform in some way. It may turn out to be nothing Or everything or something between them. So if he had an exceptional trait, Like being really sophisticated or really perfect Or really simple, like nothingness, This may require interpretation. But if it's just one of those random general facts, There is no other explanation for it. Indeed, I would like to say This is the reality we live in. This is what science tells us. At the beginning of the week, We got interesting information That theory of inflation, which you expect Reality is big, infinite, messy, arbitrary, absurd, It looks like a big champagne foam It comes out of a bottle endlessly, A vast universe, mostly wasteland With small pockets of magic, order and peace, This was confirmed, This inflationary scenario, with observations Dubbed by Antarctic Wireless Telescopes That was spotted signing gravitational waves By the big bang. I'm sure you all know this. So anyway, I think there is some evidence This is the reality that we are really afflicted with. Now, why do we have to pay attention? Well - (Laughter) - The question, \"Why does the universe exist?\" That's a universal question, and it's kind of a rhyme With a more intimate question: Why am I there? Why are you there? You know, our existence may seem surprisingly unexpected Because a large number of people are genetically possible, If you can count it from looking For the number of genes, alternatives, etc., The account will tell us fast There are about 10 to 10,000 Genetic human potential. This is between 10x100 and 10x10100. The actual number of people who have found 100 billion, it might be 50 billion, Infinitesimally small part, so we are all, We have won this amazing cosmic lottery. we are here. OK. So what kind of reality do we want to live in? Do we want to live in an exceptional reality? What if we lived in the most sublime reality? Imagine the existential pressure on us Let's rise to this, to be fine, Not to demolish harmony. Or, what if we lived in the most extreme reality possible? So if we were guaranteed, Because everything is possible Exists in that reality, But our choices will make no sense. If she really struggled morally and struggled And I decided to do the right thing, What difference does it make, Because there is an infinite number Copies of me They also do the right thing And an infinite number are making the mistake. So my actions are meaningless. So we don't want to live in that extraordinary world. And as for an extraordinary reality from scratch, We did not have to hold this lecture. So I think living in this public world is centrist. There are beautiful and ugly things We can double the favor And underestimate ugly This gives us a purpose for life. The universe is silly, But we can still build a goal, This is a very good idea And the overall moderation in this reality Kind of a beautiful echo for moderation That we feel at the core of our existence. I know that you feel it. I know you are all special, But you're still kind of moderately secret, Don't you think? (Laughter) (Applause) So anyway, you might say, this mystery, the mystery of existence, Just a ridiculous puzzle to promote. You were not surprised by the existence of the universe You are in a good group. Bertrand Russell said, \"I must say that the universe exists, and that\\'s it.\" Just a brute reality. And my professor in Colombia, Sydney Morgenpser, A great philosophical clown, When I told him, \"Professor Morgenpser, Why is there something instead of nothing? \" He said, \"Well, even if there is none, You would not be satisfied. \" So - (Laughter) - Okay. So you are not surprised. I do not care. But I will conclude by saying I guarantee you will be amazed, Because it surprised all smart people The wonderful people I've met at TED conferences, When I told them, I've never had a cell phone in my life. thank you. (Laughter) (Applause)", "2tcEgqTWbxQ": "Translator: Fatima Bamashmoos Auditor: Hussain Laghabi I'm very excited to be here. I am a big fan of TED and TEDx. I think these conferences are amazing. I am the Executive Director and Foundation Partner For Anti-AgingGames.com Today I will tell you the top ten tips To keep your brain healthy. There are tips to reduce the risk of early memory loss, And what I want you to do, If you like advice I want you to share it as widely as possible, With friends and family. I'll show you the site You will find a copy of the advice. So there is no need to write notes. Me and site experts researched us through 17,000 studies And we came up with these tips that I'm going to share with you today, These tips are applied in our games and on site. Before I start, I would like to mention some things First: I am not a doctor, I work as a game designer to live. My advice is not a prescription, You can think of it as your starting point To talk about health in the future With your doctors. Second, all good news. So do not worry, I will not scare you with anything Third: I will not sell you anything. We will give you a symbol Free games access. So don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, no extra things and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to sell you fake products, Nothing like this. (Laughter) My intention is to give you advice and nothing else. I will give you the email, Send a message to Tips@Anti-Aging-Games.com You will get a copy of the advice And a link to see tips on the site. Or go to Anti-AgingGames And click on the Memory Tips section. I started working on these tips four or five years ago When the mother of one of my friends was injured With Alzheimer's disease. I saw my girlfriend dealing with this And you try to fight the disease Emotionally, physically and financially. I noticed the belief that people are afraid to speak My girlfriend is also at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease Because Alzheimer's is a genetic disease She was bound to get it, too. But this is not correct. Absolutely incorrect. Depends on who you ask, Only 5 to 8% of Alzheimer's patients Their illness is related to genes. There is a study that shows That when there were identical twins, one of them had Alzheimer's They are identical We expect the other person to develop Alzheimer's disease 100%. But this does not happen. At 21% the other twin was not infected. Or he gets late and his disease is not hereditary. I'm here to tell you about 21%. And the lifestyle you can follow To help you reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's early. The good news is that all the advice that I will tell you Easy and free And you can start applying it today. So without any delay I will talk about the first advice. The first advice This is the most important advice just take this Brisk walking is great for the brain and heart Fast walking 30 minutes a day Five times a week Reduces the occurrence of Alzheimer's by 33%. And if you add strong aerobic exercises Will increase your heart rate, Three times a week, at least 20 minutes, Will reduce Alzheimer's risk by 50% great news. If you can't walk comfortably, Try walking on water Skiing Or if you know a person in need, advise him to use a manual chair. Any type of aerobic exercise that causes blood to flow quickly to the brain, Quickly push oxygen and nutrients to the brain It helps to improve its performance And reduces the possibility of disease It would be great for you. Your doctor will tell you if you exercise And really important for you You start exercising regularly. Try to start 10 minutes a day. I don't know your style But I am very lazy when it comes to playing sports. Too lazy. Exercising for shape never motivates me. I look ten pounds or less, who cares? (Laughter) Right. Not very stimulating. But when I read this study, Avoid Alzheimer's, Maintaining your freedom and independence for a long time, This is a great catalyst. I started walking and I have to tell you It increases energy and aids in slimming And feel healthy and happy. Of course, I recommend you. The second tip is to play with mentally stimulating games. Studies show that playing any kind of intelligence games It would be great. The secret in games is that they make you interact And move the mind And its benefit is greater if it is fun. If entertainment is ineffective Like watching TV and midday nap. (Laughter) Effective entertainment includes intelligence games Like the one on Anti-AgingGames.com. But you really don't need our games What kind of education would be awesome. You can play chess. Or play bridge (blackjack). You can learn to play a complex instrument musical instrument or a new language. It is better to have a better social or physical bond. So he learned to dance. Funny that you should not be good at it. Try the tai pooh dance, and the flamenco dance, play the harp It really doesn't matter. You do different activities than you did during the day. So your brain is developing new nerves This would be great for you. The third advice: Avoid toxins. Everyone knows lead in cigarettes. What you do not know is Middle age smoking doubles dementia rates later. What I did not know was that smoking on social occasions A cigarette on occasions It caused arterial intoxication And guess why? Because it is a toxic substance. (Laughter) You should avoid that. Also, you should avoid Aluminum, but it is incomplete if toxic Whether or not the matter has not been resolved But if you can avoid it, do. You should also avoid toxic substances in your normal life. There is cosmeticsdatabase.com, And you can put the name of the shampoo, Paste, soap, make-up, sunscreen, And all the detergents. And it will show you the toxicity of substances on a scale of one to ten, Toxic substances will be known And a safe alternative to all the products you use. Fourth tip: Being social will be great for you. A Harvard study shows that people with five social relationships, People who spend time with them, who really enjoy them Except for coworkers You do not enjoy their company if you are honest with yourself. (Laughter) Spend time with them. These people do not have half the rate for patients with cognitive decline. As if he was alone, isolated. Loneliness is bad for a person. It is very important for you to be social. If you don't have many friends, and if you move recently, And if your friends are negative, you will get rid of them. And after the advice that I said Find friends in places like: Red Hat Society. American Association of University Women. Sure there are men's associations like this But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it is. (Laughter) Mixed associations. Volunteering is also a nice opportunity to meet good people. For example, VolunteerMatch.org is great Or Idealist.org Laworks has a lot of projects in Los Angeles. It is an exceptional place. The next step is to have a goal and a direction in life that will be great for you. Researchers found the medical center at Rush University People who know their purpose in life and their direction Less prone to dementia by 2.4 times Of people who do not know their target. What this means to you You can choose any reason from outside your own circle From yourself, from friends, from family, from acquaintances, Any important reason for you. It does not matter what it is as long as it is important to you So I work on it regularly. It would be great for you and the community, And he taught other people, too. If you think about the people in this room The two generations older than me who objected On discrimination in sex and on racism Now they object to gay haters There is much to do. Choose any important reason for you and start getting things right Your mind will thank you and society as well. The next step is to relax. Great relaxation for you. I told you that I will tell you good news. Go to a relaxing resort, whatever you need Meditate, practice yoga, read a book I like to relax while on the move I like walking in nature and the like. Whatever you need, it will be fine. Because what actually happens is that stress reduces your brain And you don't want that. Stress kills brain cells Affects memory, affects decision-making. It ends up affecting the natural emotions system So this is not good for your health. I used to work a day job as a finance for Anti. AgingGames She was very tired I was reading a study on how stress weakens the brain. (Laughter) And she says that people who have a high pressure job Less control, Several managers will order you against opposite orders I lived worse than that ... This tension and contraction of the brain And my reaction was oh my god it really is my job (Laughter) So I decided to quit. And I ended up leaving my job If this is your job, start looking for a new one You do not need the job as your health is much more important. The following advice is partner with your doctor. A good doctor cares about prevention Most people stay with the same doctor because he is gentle or familiar. This is not a good reason to stay with the same doctor. You want someone who understands prevention Understands nutrition, understands exercise Understands the importance of warming up Understand the interactions between things. the reason is I can tell you about eating broccoli and flower twice a week This is great for you. Protects against various types of cancers At least 20% If you have a thyroid gland This will make the disease worse Of course, a good doctor knows that. It is impossible for you to understand all these things yourself. A good doctor will tell you that How supplements interact with other things It is very important to do it Because the substances interact and mix together. Generally, you want to get most vitamins Of fruits and vegetables It is not a nutritional supplement But your doctor may order that you use supplements as well And the good doctor knows how to do it. For example, you lack vitamin B12 It is related to forgetfulness But you cannot use supplements Because you will not know whether it is absorbed by the body or not A good doctor knows how to measure this in blood pressure And see if it is absorbed by the body If it is not absorbed by the body, you will need a monthly needle So choose a good doctor And share it with him to go together in life. The following advice, protect your head. People with head injuries Alzheimer's disease rises from two to four times If you had a wound on your head in the past Don't worry, there are many factors: What part of your head bumped and how much time were you unconscious And factors like it We will not prolong the conversation, protect your head. When driving a bike, wear a helmet. The most common place you can bump into your head is the car. Always wear a seatbelt. safety first; Put these things as your priority Never write while you drive. People who report while driving are 23 times more likely to have an accident Of people who do not write. A study confirms the equality of this Whoever drinks four cups and drives. If you find someone who is writing and driving, tell him to stop by. It is important to stop aside. The penultimate counseling is The Mediterranean diet would be great for you. One of the scientifically proven diets is helpful Also called \"color your food\". The Mediterranean diet includes seven to ten meals Of fruits and vegetables every day. I know this looks a lot But really it's really hard to gain weight with fruits and vegetables. Your stomach is finally filled up And you lose weight Natural is the best Then thyme is the best In the Mediterranean diet, people eat fish Eat fish twice a week. They eat nuts, almonds, nuts And they prefer raw, not salted And beans and legumes, Nobody knows what legumes are. (Laughter) It's peanuts and beans. (Laughter) There is a social link to the Mediterranean diet as well. This is the last tip I will tell you A positive outlook is important It is very important. If you were going to ask me as a scientist how important it is, I will say a little important But it turned out to be more important than anyone imagined What happens is that there is a study called \"The Nun Study\" They tracked 600,078 nuns during their lifetime And many nuns allowed That after their death they can be dissected. They opened their brains to see what happened To see the presence of Alzheimer's disease in the brain They found that the nuns Who use more emotionally positive words Hence the higher positive outlook Not only do they grow up healthy And they live longer and healthy It's really amazing In some cases when they explain the brains of nuns And they looked at her income Is that they found neurons and spots affected by Alzheimer's But she was not afflicted with Alzheimer's symptoms. So there is an effect of a positive outlook This is so cool, so cool And scientists will need to search for it. But you know that. What you can do for you is reduce your criticism of yourself. No discussion on this. Your mind does not distinguish between right and wrong. No discussion on this. Get rid of your negative friends, replace them with more positive people, And remember, seeing opportunities in all challenges It is a good thing. Learn from and accept your mistakes This is a good thing.

(clap)", "qS7mBbXxJYA": "Translator: Nesreen Subeh Auditor: Riyad Almubarak I grew up in a valley On the west coast of South New Zealand. Imagine the most wonderful and beautiful valley you have ever seen. A dense bush grows from the foot of a mountain and stretches towards fertile farmland Pure rivers crawling down through the Alps above. And a lake as bright as polished glass The rainbow draws colors in the sky I grew up in the (Gloriaville) Christian community 500 men, women and children. They live together and follow the teachings of Christ. My grandfather was my hero, Because he brought us to this earth, He created this community that I loved. The purchase of two farms was on the banks of the river A smart move for our group. We had migrated from the east coast and needed a livelihood I was six weeks old when I got strapped to my father's back To the place where my house will be sacrificed during the first eighteen years of my life My relatives and childhood friends were brothers to me. We were doing everything together. Camping was one of our favorite activities to spend time. We used to warm in sleeping bags under the stars And cook the Dumper bread on the ashes of the campfire. Earlier today, he had asked us to recall the happiest memory of our childhood memories. My favorite memory is Celebration Day! Imagine the most wonderful party you attended in your life when you were young. My relatives, my friends, and me We ate a dessert of girls \u00e2\u20ac\u2122pink hair and drank a lot Of sugar-filled soft drinks There were clowns walking over sticks Riding on the back of trucks Three-legged race And a plane flies over us to receive popsicles from the sky! Men built a water slide for us and a slide rope And within those days My grandfather used to announce a day off from work for our entire community! The women stopped working in the kitchen, And there were enough men coming to celebrate. And it was all free We did not pay money for this, because we did not earn money. We were not working for money, We have been working for our lifestyle. And for each other. The money we were earning from our business was kept in a popular bank account That account built the houses that we stayed in, Dressed in clothes, He fed us. I knew every member of my community personally. I just didn't know them, I knew their husbands, And their wives, children and grandchildren. We lived in shared dwellings, And we were working together. We used to go to school together, And we were praying together. I was permanently surrounded by the people I love so much, At night, I was slipping into my cousin's room a few meters away Let's get together or play cards. I loved working with other girls in the world of women. I loved learning sewing, knitting, spinning, and cooking. Music was one of my favorite hobbies. We learned music in the first school year So when I was seventeen years old She mastered playing five musical instruments. Think for a moment of your life when you accomplished something really important. Remember what you felt. Remember how proud you are at that moment. It must be a feeling similar to what I felt when I received my first school certificate. It was the most exciting days of my life as a six-year-old! You've got great marks. And the most wonderful personal comments from my teacher. You can imagine how excited I was when my grandfather took my degree And read it in front of all 500 of my community for dinner. Then he said, \"We don\\'t want women like you.\" My stomach flipped. My face turned red. I was pulling air through my nose, But I couldn't breathe. You see, my teacher wrote a sentence in my degree saying: (Lilia) shows leadership skills. It may be of use to her when she grows up. My grandfather humiliated me for hours This became a recurring theme during my years of life. After that, she left the dining room as a new six-year-old girl, What has changed is my faith I am worth something more precious than what he was seeing me. And when I was young, I spent most of my time with women. And because we used to generate women in our home, The view of the belly of a pregnant woman makes me feel at home. My mother grew up with fifteen brother and sister. I have nine brothers. I was seven When I first saw a newborn baby I held scissors with both hands and cut his umbilical cord. He was a blue relative, because the umbilical cord was strangling him So after I saved him, The midwife conducted a shock assessment with me, Because I was ten at the time I held my aunt's hand when she gave birth to her next child On a mattress in the back of a truck en route to the nearest hospital. My father was the effective manager of a company. My mother was the leader of all women. She led the world of housekeeping in Gloriaville. I wanted to be like her when I grow up. Her work was demanding. And because my father was always on business, She needed help raising children. So I was changing diapers, I train the children in the bathroom And I leave my bed in the middle of the night I even shake them to go back to sleep. Cleaned vomit, She rubbed them with warm clothes, She helped wean them from their mother's milk. I couldn't stand patience until I got older and get married He fathered my husband's children. I was talking to my cousin a lot about this, So it was a very exciting day for me When I was twelve and my period came Because I can achieve my goal in life And when I was fourteen, I knew with whom I would like to achieve that goal. His name was Welling. It would have been a good marriage. I was the granddaughter of the founder of the church, He was the son of (Vervent), one of the leaders of the church. And one day I was sitting in class, When Vervent rushed through the door, he pulled Welling off his shoulder Welling misbehaved I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember what he did, He might have had his hair gone wrong Or a response in the face of his father Or listen to music that is forbidden to him Or read a book that he is not allowed to read This was not important. The penalty was one. (Welling) was forced to bend over and take off his pants My stomach flipped When (Verwent) brought the leather belt Then they told us to watch Vervent. And he hits Welling with a belt, And I refused to watch, Instead, I stared at my stairs as I whispered, \"Please, God, let it stop.\" Please make it stop! at that moment My respect for driving Vervent. Dissipate. I knew that what he had done was wrong. They taught us a lot about God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love, So much so that when I watched Vervent hit his son, I realized that this was not love It was not love Even though after Vervent had finished hitting his son, He hugged him and told him he loved him. This is not love. I became suspicious of the rules we are taught. The leaders kept saying, \"Don\\'t use the stick, and the child spoils.\" My blood started to boil when one of the wives brought her baby to me And the blue bruise showed me on the child's back I brushed my teeth \"How can anyone say of himself as a Christian\" \"He treats a child this way?\" \"How can a father or mother treat a child like this ?!\" My friend (Jubilant) was not spoiled. He was born into one of the poorest families in our society Without any link to the leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u2122rings. The funny boy was on our side, He always says the coolest things to make us laugh. Imagine Your brother, One of your children, Your nephew and niece, Your daughter, The person who laughs everyone, The clown, That is Jubilant. One day during a football match Jubelant exceeded the limit of jokes. And when our teacher (Nathaniel) started punching and kicking, My stomach flipped again. The game stopped, And without us all terrified, And I thought (Nathaniel) would stop. But it did not. (Jubilant) was forced to walk From the football stadium to the main building All while punching and kicking him. (Jubilant) was sobbing He raises his hands to repel blows. And I said to myself (Nathaniel) must be exempt from our teaching profession But the next day he returned to class with us And I said to myself, \"What is wrong with these people who run this place?\" \"I don\\'t want to have children here.\" Not wanting to have children was a sin and forbidden. My best friend (Grace) was an unwanted baby. Her mother abandoned her at birth And her adoptive parents transferred her to our community from the United States of America Hoping that our good effect will correct it. Excuse me. She was a Mexican with brown skin like chocolate And she reached (Gloriaville) when she was thirteen. Ie three years older than me. I loved that girl more than my life. She was laughing and feeling safe. So we became our best friend. We spent as many moments as possible together. (Grace) brought with her private property from the outside world: Music, Jewelry, Cosmetics. It was forbidden. Seeing it for the first time made Grace more unique to me. Her rebellious spirit inspired me. And over the years, (Grace) was punished many times Because she refused to be controlled. She was twenty years old when she came to tell me That the leaders have ordered her to marry her to a man she does not like. She was crying burning. Trembling! Tears were pouring down her cheeks. In a moment of despair, she packed her luggage, And hide them under a tree, She called a friend from the outside world to come and save her. But it was discovered. And she was taken to an inspection court consisting of twenty men sitting in a small room, Condemned, She was forced to admit that she is evil, She was forced to contact her family in the outside world to tell them that she did not want to leave anymore. And I said to myself, \"Damn them!\" \"No one has the right to tell my girlfriend what she should do.\" I put it in my arms and told her \"Do not listen to them.\" Do what you think is right. Luckily, Her adoptive parents acted, Contact Gloraville. They threatened to send the police if they did not allow Grace to leave. The next day she was gone. She now lives happy in Canada. Excuse me. After the accident with Grace, I knew I had to leave, too. Otherwise, I will be forced to marry a man I do not like And I knew I had to take my little sisters with me, Otherwise, the same will happen with them. I was already ready. When I was eleven, My older sister ran away. And when I was thirteen, My second older sister also ran away. And when I was seventeen, My younger brother threatened to leave. I didn't know at the time, but my parents were preparing to leave as well. But they couldn't bear the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039losing another child. They were waiting for me to change my mind so we can stay together And after what happened with Grace, I was ready to leave. I left (GloriaVille) with my entire family after I left it (Grace) less than a year ago. And after leaving the sect, I became obsessed with learning what I could learn about human behavior, Because I thought, \"If I can better understand myself and others, I will protect myself, And I will prevent anyone from using me again. \" As I write the story of my life in a religious sect, I realized that the leaders of Gloriaville Use harsh methods to control and manipulate me. They started to use humiliation For insulting me in front of the people I love. It started when my grandfather publicly humiliated me To meet my certificate at the age of six. His act sent a clear message stating who was in power We all knew what would happen to those who opposed the Church's authority. But the matter did not end there They made me feel guilty for diminishing my self-worth. When I was a child, they used to tell me every day That I am worthless unrighteous. That guilt is my fault Because I'm evil I am to blame. When people mistreated me, I thought I deserved it. I had difficulty thinking about healthy self Because I always doubted: What if it was my mistake What if you are to blame? Well, they might have disappointed me But they spoiled the matter when they mistreated their loved ones. My anger at the injustice that Grace, Jubilant and Welling suffered It gave me strength that I couldn't summon on my own. I could not stand aside and watch my loved ones suffer unjustly. My love for others broke the chains that tied me But why am I ready to love them but not to love myself? In the end I realized I can learn to love myself I also loved Welling. I also loved Jubilant and Grace. I also loved my little sisters. Then I will not accept other people's misfortune. So I asked, What does it mean to love myself? What does it mean to love myself completely so much? That if someone tries to humiliate me again, I will be the one to defend myself. I do not have all the answers, but I have come a long way. And I became aware My sixth school certificate was perfect (Laughter) (clap) And my grandfather was afraid of strong women! (Laughter) I am a strong woman. I am a leader. I know today My leadership skills are precious. I used to leave the church And I find my own way in the world which, honestly, It still scares me so badly. I used my skills when I was 23 to run a private business To write a book that teaches others what they can do. Now that I'm 27, I use my skills to stand with you here today I use it every day to remind myself of a six-year-old Being able to do whatever you want And don't let anyone tell her otherwise! Thank you. (Applause) (Cheering)", "MdZAMSyn_As": "6 years ago, I was sitting with my friends in New York When he found a notification on my phone, I was amazed to find a text message from my grandmother. I was surprised because my grandmother was 78 at the time, She had never sent a text message before. And I'll tell you that the first message was great. She said, \"Dear Andrew, I'm trying to write a letter. My love, your grandmother.\" And I said, \"She thinks it's a letter!\" She replied to her message, \"Hi Grandma, it's a message. You don't have to include all of it.\" Her response was, \"Dear Andrew, OK. My love, your grandmother. \" My favorite part is always \"my love, your grandmother.\" If it were \"my love, the grandmother\", I would be confused. And if she said, dear Andrew, have fun in Texas, my love, grandmother, I'll be surprised, \"Grandma? Who is Grandma?\" (Laughter) But my grandmother still knows some things. Two years ago, I went to Switzerland to work, I came back, and I sent a message to my grandmother: Hi my grandmother, I just came from Switzerland. \" Her response was, \"Dear Andrew, Switzerland? (WTF)\" (Laughter) So, I called my grandmother, Grandma, what do you mean by (WTF)? And she said, \"Well, someone told me at the bridge that it means (Wow, that's fun).\" (Laughter) And I said, \"That's exactly what you mean.\" I will not explain it to my grandmother. But over time, I realized I think the world may be a happier place If most people think of (WTF) - If most people are like my grandmother and think \"Wow, that's fun.\" Because in 2012, I quit my job at P&amp;G. To teach people the value of humor. She has worked with more than 35,000 people in more than 250 organizations On how to be more productive, happy, and less stressful with humor. But when people hear about what I'm doing, they're a little bit skeptical, (Laughter) Because no one thinks humor is a bad thing. Is there someone here who doesn't like to laugh? Anyone say \"No, I hate having fun in my body?\" (Laughter) No, people think humor is secondary. If I enjoy my job more, if I have some fun, it would be great, But if not, well. The truth is, humor is a must. In today's culture, exhausted, unappreciated, strained and sleep deprived Humor is necessary. Because humor makes people listen, It increases long-term memory retention, It improves understanding and helps in learning And help deliver messages. Group cohesion also improved, Reduces differences, defuses conflicts, and builds confidence. And people got close to each other. It does these things (Laughter) These are many things ... All are based on case studies research and real examples. (Laughter) And these are some of its amazing benefits, right? Humor can help you look better, live longer, and make it rain, right? (Laughter) Because people who use humor get better pay. And anyone can learn these benefits. Because when I talk to people about humor or comedy, Sometimes they are afraid. That event I went to in Switzerland two years ago And that made my grandmother say (WTF), He was scheduled to speak at a conference. And one of the speakers at that conference was this mr. His name is \"Kevin Richardson\". Also known as the whisper of lions. If you see a YouTube video of a lion hugging a man, it is this person. He lives in South Africa, And he raises black from a young age, They treat him like one of the herd. It is mainly the human version of \"Raviki\" in \"The Lion King\". But Kevin and I were talking before the event. And found out that I'm performing impromptu comedy, \"I can never do that, it is very scary,\" he said. (Laughter) And I said \"But you live with lions!\" (Laughter) It's like making a joke more terrifying than living with lions. (Laughter) But many people have this perception As if the ability to make people laugh is somehow encoded in our DNA. (Laughter) But the truth is that humor is a skill, And if it's a skill, then that means you can learn it. Because I am one of the people who have learned how to use humor. Because I made a lot of shows As an impromptu, improvised, narrated and eloquent comedian. She performed in 50 states, 18 countries and one planet. (Laughter) And I have fans in over 150 countries, Depending on the people who entered my site by chance. I was described as humorous and intelligent, at least that's what my mom says. (Laughter) And I was seen on \"The Daily Show\" with John Stewart, among the audience. (Laughter) I recently went to a school reunion party, And when people found out that I was working as a stand-up comedian, They said, \"But you are not fun.\" In some ways, they are right Because I will tell you that this is not a fun face. (Laughter) There is so much fun about this picture; None of them is intentional. (Laughter) I have blonde parties on top of my head as if I wanted to be in a band. The topic was \"To dream,\" but I am not anyone's dream .. (Laughter) in this picture. Because when I matured, I had no spirit of celebration or was a class clown. In the final year, I was chosen to be a spoiled teacher boy. This will surprise many of you, but this is because I am complicated. If you are wondering what type of complexity, The answer is yes: computer, mathematics, science fiction, Dungeons and Dragon, Star Wars, Star Track, Starbucks, all. (Laughter) But specifically, an engineer. I joined Ohio State University, She obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. After graduation, I started working at Bacter &amp; Gamble as an IT Project Manager. And that's what people expected me to do, Because based on my personal assessment, That's what it suggests that I should be a computer science engineer. But I learned that we are not as a personality assessment, Because my review means I am Class A blue square, Al-Dameer neighborhood, Intig with a watermark. This means that I am ambitious, stubborn, and introverted He loves long walks on the beach, But I learned that we are not like our personal assessments. It may give us insight into our behavior Or tell us what drives us Or tell us which Disney princess we might be like Pocahontas. (Laughter) But she does not know our personalities; it is our actions that define her. So I started doing comedy in college. My best friend in the middle wanted to make a group for impromptu comedy. And he wanted people and forced me to join. And you can tell me from this picture that we were not adept. At least to get started, we had no idea what we were doing. And we watched the program, \"To whom is this line anyway?\" And we tried to repeat what we saw. What lacked me in the skill of comedy was that I created comedy project management. \"If we are going to do it seriously; We have to train three times a week, And we will have a business meeting every Monday, We will again see our shows as a match bar. \" And over two years, we got better. We moved on from the exercise in the basement of the university city To rehearse at the university theater twice a week, We never learned how to take a good picture. But that's how you learn the skill of humor. Through practice and repetition. And anyone can do these things. You don't have to become a professional comedian to use comedy, But we can learn from professionals. For example, from impromptu shows, we learn how to share your opinions. Because Louis CK has a specific perspective on seeing the world, Which differs from \"Ellen de Generis\", Which differs from \"Tig Notaro,\" \"Dave Chappelle,\" or \"Chris Rock.\" Everyone has their own perspective. Some people told me I look like a combination of Hugh Jackman and Conan O'Brien. (Laughter) Others told me, \"As if I see David Tennant, Dr. Hu's actor.\" And a lady told me, I think you look like Justin Timberlake, but from here to here. (Laughter) I will ignore the person who told me I look like \"Clay Aiken\". Totally Correct. Everyone has their own perspective. And we can use that perspective as a way to communicate with others, right? We can use it to say, \"We are alike.\" How many people here love candy? People love sweets. I love sweets. I am obsessed with milkshakes. It's the best possible candy. Because of the good taste of the ice cream in a way that is easy to eat. But I do not understand chocolate mint. I do not know any fan of chocolate mint. I have not eaten chocolate before \"Do you know what this taste looks like? Toothpaste\" (Laughter) We can share a perspective as a way to communicate. We can also share a perspective to prove a point. Because I will tell you I have always understood computers more than my understanding of humans. Because when something goes wrong with the computer, We receive an error message. But when something goes wrong with a human being, You find feelings. (Laughter) Things will get easier if a person comes with wrong messages, is not it? Saying you're exhausted, exhausted, and a little pressured, It will only appear: \"Warning! System overload.\" (Laughter) \"Please restart after taking a nap.\" Because we all know that naps are the human version From \"Just close it and restart it again.\" Some error messages will not have to be changed. For example, outside you are courting a waitress, and she didn't feel it. It will only appear: \"Error. Unable to establish a connection to the server.\" (Laughter) Things will get very easy. But in reality, humans are not computers, Regardless of how wonderful they pretend to be. Because, as human beings, we need not only time management, but also energy management. Because it doesn't matter what time we have If we don't have the energy to do anything with it. From improvised presentations, we learned how to discover and highlight an opinion. Because the primary thinking style for improvisation is \"yes, then dwell on\". How Improvisers in Yossi Be, Second City and Comedy Sports Create Things In their head. And how can we do the same? Follow their example, accept and build, discover, highlight and say, \"If this is true, what else is true?\" Because that led me to realize Florida The rapper, \"Flow Raida\", was named after his native Florida And put a space between him. And that surprised me! (Laughter) We can say, \"If this is true, what else could be true?\" We can say, \"I think there should be a Spanish factory in Dover To be closer to de la ware. (Laughter) Or like, \"There might be an Internet checker in Biloxi To be closer to Macy's. (Laughter) If this is true, what else is true? If we use \"yes, dwell\" to create humor, We can also use \"yes, then redundancy\" as a way to communicate with others. We can think of those short, typical conversations When people say, \"What do you think about the weather?\" It says, \"Yes, and if you are not abroad now, How will you enjoy the weather outside? \" We can turn any embarrassing conversation into something more useful When you can get to know the person. \"Nice weather like this, go out, park or swim.\" If you were me, you would stay home, because you are so pale. I like to use sunscreen buildings; they are the best. Get to know people by agreeing to \"Yes, then verbally\" We can also use the principle of approval and then elaborate for more fun Because the truth is that the average people work is 90 thousand hours in their lives. 90 thousand hours! For that entire period, the netflix discs list is complete. That's a lot of time. And we can say, \"Yes, I'm going to work 90,000 hours, And I enjoy it too. \" Between my first and last year in high school, I worked at a factory, And I'll tell you it wasn't a pleasant job. And then, I thought maybe, in the future, I would like to become a global hip-hop superstar. So, to pass the time, I thought about rhymes in my head, I wrote it down in a little notebook later. And I found one of these notes I discovered why I had never become a hip-hop superstar. Because one of these rhymes was, Hydrogen plus hydrogen plus oxygen also combined with covalent glue. What will you get, just something called water, Yes, it forms a team, and it gets hotter. \" (Laughter) That is why I have never become a hip-hop superstar. But it still helps me to spend time, create humor and fun. And at the end of the scene, We can learn the importance of commitment to performance. Because the characters on Saturday Night Live, Ki and Bill, and Monty Python. They are very fun, because the actors are committed to performing. They trust their presentations, Because it's like dating, isn't it? People tell you they want to date trusted people. Two years ago, I was with some friends in a bar, And I saw this beautiful girl at the bar. \"You should talk to her.\" \"I can not do that.\" \"Why not?\" \"I have no trick\" \"You don't need a trick, but you just need confidence.\" But they do not tell you that they want that confidence in some areas. Because no lady does not need a man with confidence in mathematics. (Laughter) This is what I have. (Laughter) So I said, \"Okay. I'll try to start a conversation using math.\" So, I went to the girl and said, \"Hey, girl.\" (Laughter) \"Are you a vertical asymptote? Because your beauty has no limits.\" (Laughter) And she said, \"What did you say now?\" (Laughter) And I started again, and I said, \"Hey, girl. Are you the opposite corner of the hypotenuse? Because you make me sin. \" (Laughter) And she said, \"I think you better leave.\" So she left, okay? But a few hours later, I said, \"What I had to say is, \"Girl, you are much higher than average, don't be cruel.\" (Laughter) He brought it up with you before, When you think about something for 4 hours after the event? That's really a good thing, and it's called ideal thinking too late. The idea that \"this moment is happening now,\" And later you think about this idea on the stairs. And that's a good sign, because that means you have a comedic talent. Through practice and repetition, You can shorten the time it takes to create humor From 4 hours to 3 hours later, Just two hours, 10 minutes, to what is happening now. Because reflection of the past leads to work in the future. With that, we become more comfortable and confident using humor, The more we actually do it. Like what my mom (Cody) says: \"pretend to be successful.\" I know there are some people Who say, \"Well, Justin Timberlake's eyes.\" (Laughter) \"And what if I'm not fun?\" The truth is that if I laugh at someone before, Even if it was because of your failure during your climb, Then you might still use humor. But even if you are not ready to try to create humor, You can still benefit from humor by being a sponsor. You can share quotes, TED conversations that you enjoyed, Or you can use the images in your presentations. Because I did not take this picture. I did not go to Sri Lanka. I don't know this shepherd or any of these goats. I found it on Flickr under a Creative Commons license I shared it with you, because I enjoyed it. But even if you are not ready to create humor, And don't think you can find something interesting on the Internet, You can still use humor if you know how to smile. Because when you see another person smile, We are ready to reverse that behavior unlike the neurons in our minds. And when we smile, they smile: we create human contact. Others say, \"But if no one laughs? And what if you tried humor, and there was an embarrassing silence? \" It will be embarrassing only if you spend time on it, If you get caught up in it. The truth is that no one was fired for a silly joke. Maybe an inappropriate joke, but not bad. Because the silly joke is like, \"I had to miss the class because of the low temperature I was too cold to go to school. \" (Laughter) This is a silly joke. (Laughter) An inappropriate joke is an inappropriate subject. Or the target is inappropriate, or occur at an inappropriate time. But as long as we are positive. (Laughter) And we will be okay. Because if no one laughs at our prank, It is only a comprehensive and positive statement. In the end, people say \"What if no one takes me seriously?\" \"What if people think I'm a clown or a tumbler?\" If you are going to use humor to work, I realize that humor will not replace work. Humor is like table salt. You can't have a meal full of salt, right? Because that might make you a horse. Would you like to be a horse? I say no. (Laughter) But you can still use humor It always makes it more productive. Managers really want it. Because they know that you will be more involved and achieve better results. But let's say you work in an organization that states fun! The truth is that no one can control your thinking. No one can stop you from listening to comedy broadcasts On your way to work Thus, you relieve stress and become more present among your family. No one can stop you from creating a Twitter account to play with words. No one can stop you from composing rap chemistry while you work. The truth is that job satisfaction, your point of view, and your method of stress management It is your responsibility, and it is your choice. This is a skill of humor. Begins with sharing your point of view, Discover and highlight this point of view. We use the principle of approval and elaboration in our work and life. In the end, we practice, do, and repeat, Because that makes us improve. People can take an improvisation lesson, or try to improvise comedies, But we can be more familiar with how to create humor every day. And everyone can do these things. And I will tell you, the envelope of someone I know is my grandmother, who wrote to me. And raised its level of writing letters to Facebook. She is now on Facebook and comments on all updates to my case. I cannot tell you If my grandmother is the most honest and loyal in the world, Or she mocks me secretly. (Laughter) Two months ago they were published \"I try to decide if I should become a sports player or a criminal, I have prepared a list of pros and cons. \" My grandmother\u2019s response was one word: \u201cfunny.\u201d (Laughter) And I said, \"I don't know. Do you think it's funny, or do you mess with me? \" Two weeks later, I published, \"I think a cozy brasserie serving figs can make dating great.\" My grandmother's response was, \"Ha, ha.\" (Laughter) And I said, \"There is something wrong about the comma.\" (Laughter) And I said, \"She messes with me.\" Two weeks later, it was published \"Converting the numbers 51,6 and 500 into Roman numerals makes me angry.\" (Laughter) My grandmother replied, \"This is really good.\" (Laughter) My grandmother mocks me. (Laughter) It doesn't matter how old you are, your income, or your point of view, Your personal evaluation, or super alumni of your school Or your famous peers. Anyone can learn to be funny. And it all starts with a choice, Choosing to try to find ways to use humor, Choose to be like my grandmother, To see the world around you and think about \"WTF\" Wow, that's fun. thank you (clap)", "ZSHBmS_GG7o": "hey guys how you doing we're down in Amsterdam today we're gonna do some magnet fishing the city's 800 years old so some of these canals we're gonna break out the Beast this thing that really is the Beast it's probably one of the strongest magnets you can buy if it's down there we'll find it so we're looking for things like iPhones as well sunglasses we'll find coins wallets handbags bikes can also find some gun you've got to see this Oh what do we got what do we got this is pretty promising oh yeah see look at this this is really old this is like some type of crest like which could have come off of a house or a boat that is old that's exactly what we're looking for very cool fine how about that for a start really cool there now I'm gonna get my magnitude yeah very excited with this one this is a super-strong magnet it goes all around has no casing on it and it's specifically made for magnet fishing and we are in like  I'll spin it around don't fall off don't fall off mention it's a real one I'm going back to the casino and cash that in it's in there it's a fake clock look at that stuff now let's just move it up everything that is a square nail check that out that's a really old nail and a big one too what's this little key there that's a bike key so we take that off and rinse oh yeah you got to buy click a day yeah first bike of the day yeah you can do it come on okay let's get this bike yeah oh you got him yeah  can you reach down and grab it fabs scrub on your near you grab the wheel  okay can you hold the rope grab this rope for me this one yeah hold it tight got it  yeah all right nice work bubs how did you lose the bike two months in the canal all right come come and get your bike we just found this girl's bike in the canal here if you've got the key for it it's yours otherwise five euros and it's yours  all right Cinderella with the bike key let's have a go  okay there you got all right there's the walk point it up for you enough you know you can get a maybe a beer light a bit of a cleanup bit of love and she'll be all good so much fun this magnificient you got to come down to try it you might have a black bear suit look here we go keep going drop it back at all or you've already got some stuff on there  yeah yeah it looks like I thought it was a phone cover no there is it's a wallet you right there you go look at that you got a wallet man I thought it's a phone cover and then stolen wallet we'll try and find on Facebook yeah it's been in the water since 2010 that's when it expired yes I mean it's a long time let's see if we get it okay I'm on it  it could be a scooter oh I got slipping I'm back on oh my gosh it's slipping it's off I lost it too let's try again I gotta get I can see I got money on there already yeah yeah look at this thing that looks cool like vintage door handle yeah it's a doll Dutch Guilder free free euro ten cent there we go there's another coin two coins here to you all right now we're making it rain with some real money okay we could this is not off an old door hinge  the magnets are because I all right let's get it then I'm on it now this is super strong look at the bubbles coming out from there as I pull it up I don't to fall in I'm actually slipping man look at the bubbles come yeah all right I got it it's huge first of all I can barely just that's like thank you look at all the bubbles come on it's off its off okay we're gonna get back for that  scooter at the bar that is crazy let's go around this pull this thing out huh look at it weighs a ton  Gobert bill  he's so sore so the Beast magnet ages the Beast I pulled this whole I don't know how much it weighs maybe 200 kilos I feel like 500 I pulled this whole thing out with that magnet and maybe it's a bit too much because I am exhausted police have just turned up it's probably a stolen scooter so let's try and find out you know if we can get some insurance for at least for the owner I don't know how I'm gonna get a magnet off now you know that's something else anyone want a scooter here comes the crane down here it's gonna pull up  stole a bike guard right now so many people are walking around on the look  so that was one epic magnet fishing adventure first of all we got the flag which was stolen from me oh she thought it stolen but I fell in the river and we got this scooter to be taken away by now we just stole when the police came craned it out and I am exhausted got some old artifacts and coins what what do you want magnet fishing don't forget to Like subscribe and comment if you want more videos see you soon", "v_ONFix_e4k": "Translated by: Mathilde Kennis Checked by: Axel Saffran Thank you for coming. My father died on 8 February 2012. That was the day his heart stopped beating. But actually my father had died years earlier. It started with slight forgetfulness, and over time his memory failed more often and more often, and it came to the point where he no longer recognized his own children. His personality changed and he could no longer take care of himself. And... If you could make a list of everything that could happen to you, then the last on your list, at the very bottom, what you least want are Alzheimer's disease, because if you lose your memory, you lose everything. You lose everyone you ever loved. If you look at the brain of someone with that disease, you see that there are crazy structures between the brain cells. Beta-amyloid protein is derived from the cells and it piles into small meatball-like structures like this one here, on a microscopic plate. They shouldn't be there and they are a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. This disease affects nearly half of Americans in their mid-80s. You could tell your doctor: \"Okay, I don\\'t want that. What can I do to stop it?\" Your doctor will say, \"Well, it\\'s aging and genes.\" There is a gene - the APOE- [epsilon] 4 allele. If you inherited this gene from a parent, your risk tripled. If you inherited it from both parents, your risk is 10 to 15 times higher. What is the solution? Take new parents? No, I don't think so. That is not the solution. So I'm sorry: it's aging, it's the genes, period; there's nothing you can do about it, just wait for it to happen. Or maybe not. Researchers started in Chicago the Chicago Health and Aging Project. They looked at what people ate in Chicago. They made accurate reports of what hundreds of people ate, and then they began to see who, as the years passed, remained mentally clear and who developed dementia. The first thing they came up with was something I already knew as a child when I was growing up in Fargo, North Dakota. My mother had five children, each of whom ran into the kitchen with the smell of bacon. My mother then took a fork, put it in the pan and fished out the hot bacon to put them on kitchen paper to cool, and when all the bacon was out of the pan, she carefully lifted the hot pan and poured the fat into a jar for storage - that's good bacon fat, you don't want to waste that! My mother then took the pot, and she placed it not in the fridge but on a shelf, because she knew that when fat cools down, what happens with it? It's getting hard. And the fact that it is fixed at room temperature shows that bacon fat is full of saturated fat, bad fat. We have known for a long time that it raises cholesterol, and bacon fat is full of it. And by the way: the next day she spooned it again in a frying pan to bake eggs; unbelievable that none of her children died young. This is how we lived. However, bacon is not the main source of saturated fat. These are dairy products: cheese, milk, etc.; and meat gets a second place. In Chicago, some ate relatively little saturated fat, about 13 grams per day, and others ate twice as much, and the researchers just looked at who developed Alzheimer's. Shall I show the graphs? Here is the low group, and here is the high group. Those who avoided bad fat ran a fairly low risk, but who filled themselves with cheese and bacon had a risk of two, three, or even more times higher. After this, they not only looked at saturated fat, but also the fat that you find in donuts and pastries; you know them, trans fats, as indicated on the labels. They found the same pattern there. So people who avoided saturated fats and trans fats, did so in view of cholesterol and heart disease, but apparently they also have an effect on the brain. After this, Finnish researchers said, \"Wait, we dig deeper.\" There is a disease called mild cognitive impairment. You are still yourself - you manage your finances, drive the car, your friends will remember you - but you are mistaken on a regular basis, especially concerning names and words. They took over 1,000 people aged 50 years and took a closer look at their eating habits. They investigated over time who developed mild cognitive impairment. Some ate relatively little fat, some a larger amount, and they watched whose memory began to deteriorate. They found exactly the same pattern. In other words, it\\'s not just: \"Shall I get Alzheimer\\'s?\" But: \"Will I only have age-related memory problems?\" But what about that gene, that APOE [epsilon] 4 allele that you curse to Alzheimer's? They did the study and only focused on those people, and some ate relatively little fat, some ate more fat, and -- Exactly the same. In other words, if you avoid bad fats, even if you have that gene, reduces your risk of developing memory problems by 80%. And this is my most important point: genes don't determine your destiny. Let's review those protein slices. We know that there is beta amyloid, but there is also iron and copper. Metal in my brain? Yes, there is metal in food and it ends up in your brain. Now think for a moment: I have a cast-iron pan, and we had a barbecue in our yard, and a week later I remember: \"Oh... I left the pan on the picnic table, and it rained last week. \" What happened to my pan? She rusted, and that rust is oxidation. Or take a shiny new coin, will that shine forever? No, it also oxidizes. Well, iron and copper oxidize in your body, and while they do that they cause the production of free radicals. You probably already heard about it: free radicals are molecules who swim in your bloodstreams and get into your brain, and they act like sparks which burn the connections between cells. How does this happen? How do I get that iron? How do I get that buyer? How did that happen? Which of you has a cast iron pan? Put your hand up. If you only use it once a month, I say, \"What difference does it make?\" But if you use them daily, iron will end up in your food and that is more iron than your body needs. Or copper pipes. Who has copper pipes? The water is in those copper pipes all night and goes into the coffee machine in the morning, and then you drink that copper, more than you need, and that then produces free radicals that go to the brain. If you eat meat - and especially liver - you also get iron and copper as a result. We used to think, \"Isn\\'t that fantastic?\" until we realized that iron is a double-edged sword. You need some, but if you get too much, it becomes toxic. Vitamins. Vitamin producers add vitamin A and vitamins B, and vitamin C, and vitamin D. Then they add iron and copper, because 'You need them anyway', without acknowledging that we have had enough of it through our diet, and through those supplements you get too much. Okay, so what do I want to say now? I want to say that not only saturated and trans fats increase our risk, but also those metals, and that they form sparks in the brain, free radicals that scorch the connections. If that's the case, I need a fire extinguisher. And we have that, namely vitamin E. Vitamin E is in spinach and in mangos and especially in nuts and seeds. And in Chicago some ate a bit of it, and some ate a lot of it, and the beauty is that vitamin E is an antioxidant: it destroys free radicals. So if what I claim is true, then the people in Chicago would eat just a little bit of vitamin E run a much higher risk than those who ate a lot, and that is exactly what the research showed. Who ate eight milligrams of vitamin E a day, the risk of Alzheimer's nearly halved compared to those who ate less. Hmm, okay, how do I get enough in then? That is very simple: go to the store and just buy some pills with vitamin E. No, not because of that. In nature there are eight forms of vitamin E. It is in nuts and seeds, but if I put it in my supplements, Is it legal to have vitamin E if only one form is present? And if you eat too much of one specific form limits the absorption of all other forms. So you want to take it through food; that's how nature designed it for us and that is the form in which we evolved. We can go one step further. By the way, I forgot to mention something. How much do we need? If I take some nuts or seeds in my palm and it comes to your fingers, that's about 30 grams, and that's about five milligrams of vitamin E. The thing is: don't eat that, because you know what happens then. If you take such salted almonds and you eat your hand empty, then you fill it up again and eat it again. Salted nuts are irresistible, or is that me? They are addictive in a certain way. So don't do it that way, you consume more than necessary. You better take them in your hand and then crumble and put on your salad, in your oatmeal porridge, or on your pancakes. Use them as a seasoning and not as a snack, then you're in the right place. Good, researchers at the University of Cincinnati went one step further. Not just saturated fats, trans fats, or vitamin E, but they said: \"What about color?\" Take a look at blueberries and grapes: that color is particularly intense. And the color of blueberries is not just for beauty; we call it anthocyanins. They investigated a certain group with an average age of 78, of which everyone had memory problems. They asked them to drink half a liter of grape juice every day. A glass in the morning and an evening. Three months later they tested everyone, and their memory was better. Three months? That sounds too simple. How is that possible? Think for a moment: a grape has a hard life. It must hang on the vine all day under the sun, exposed to the elements, without protection. Or is it? That purple color, those anthocyanins, forms a powerful antioxidant, just like vitamin E, but then in grape form. And when you eat it, it ends up in your bloodstream. They don't necessarily have to be grapes, but anything with that color. Such as blueberries. Back to the laboratory: a new group of patients came, all with memory problems. Blue berry juice after three months their memory was better. The moral of the story is not to eat grapes and blueberries and drink their juice. No, color is the answer. If we look at colorful food, we learn an important lesson. You walk into the supermarket, and from meters away you recognize in the shelves beta-carotene, lycopene, anthocyanins. Your retina can detect them because it is the orange color of carrots, or the red color of tomatoes, or the purple color of grapes. And your brain then tells you that this is beautiful and attractive, you recognize the antioxidants and are attracted to them. So in 2009 my organization went, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, to the department of agriculture. We said, \"This is important. Get rid of the food pyramid.\" It had a nice shape, but it had a box for meat, and a box for dairy, despite the fact that people who do not eat meat or dairy be healthier than people who do. By the way, who eats from a pyramid now? We eat from a plate. So we came up with a plate indicating fruit, grains, legumes and vegetables, because they must be our main components. We passed this on to the USDA in 2009 but we heard nothing from them. So in 2011 we sued the federal government. The Physicians Committee against the USDA, simply to provoke a response. And did you see what the American government came up with that year? I don't want to walk with honor but this is now the government policy called MyPlate, and it looks somewhat similar on what we sent them a few years earlier. Fruit, and grains, and vegetables, and there is a so-called 'protein group'. That group may consist of meat, but also beans, or tofu, or nuts, or anything rich in protein, it doesn't have to be meat. There is actually no meat group in the federal guidelines. There is still a dairy group, but soy milk is included. So it's heading in the right direction. What we talked about so far is the avoidance of saturated fats, such as in cheese, bacon, and meat; avoiding trans fats and snacks; eating vitamin E and colorful food, and there is one final step. It is not only about nutrition, but also about exercise. At the University of Illinois researchers brought in 120 adults and allowed them to walk briskly three times a week. A year later, everyone took a brain scan. They looked at the hippocampus, the memory station in the center of the brain: that determines what is stored in the memory and what is not allowed. It now appeared that this body, that with age gets shrinking, suddenly stopped shrinking. They saw with the moving group that the hippocampus got a little bigger, and a little bigger, and a little bigger, as if time went backwards: It reversed the shrinking of the brain and they clearly outperformed on memory tests. So I designed my own sports plan. I would like to introduce it to you, I do this three times a week. Arrive at the airport as late as possible, carrying extremely heavy luggage, and then running for that plane. (Laughter) They had a different idea at the University of Illinois, and that was a bit simpler. Take a ten-minute walk and do it three times a week. The following week you do a 15-minute walk, and the next week 20. They just added five minutes a week to 40 minutes. Such a brisk walk of 40 minutes - this is not about dribbling, but really decent steps - 40 minutes, three times a week, is all you need for your memory and the size of your brain. Very easy. I would like to go back in time, and talk to my father and say to him: \"Dad, I have discovered something very important. We change our diet, we don't really need that cheese and that bacon. There are more than enough healthy things to eat. We go for colorful vegetables and fruit, and make it a daily habit. We put on our sneakers and move together. \" It's too late for him. But it's not too late for you. Neither for me, and if we use what we have learned now about how we can protect our brain, then families might be able to stay together a little longer. Thank you very much.", "vPTgJkW6CL8": "it's be the end of the barbecue today restaurant I go on with Tony so before I show you how to select your rebind I'm going to show you how to cook the right guys so first what we gonna do you see this piece here same piece as we had before we're going to cut off about an inch and a half that's a nice steak I don't like to have my steaks too thin because otherwise they dry out what we're going to do here it's a nice chunk look at this here this is fantastic meat look at that this is what we want here so what we're going to do here is trim off the fat just a little bit of fat we're going to reach him it again and after we going to use this to cook our steak it's gonna be the oil for a steak so we're gonna put this aside in a pan there you go then we're going to put this thing in the other pan and we're gonna move to the other station but I teach you how to cook the steak see you in a second so we're at the range right now I'm going to show you how to cut steak at thickness I remember thicker is better so remember we have these five tiers of which involved we kind of use it as oil for our state if you use at normal vegetable oil it's going to burn out you use clutter your clutter is going to throw how this is the thing stakes so we need to shake some poxy make a little smooth here turn the fire down go watch some smoke but not too much smoke all right so you see here on me is all real salt like brownish the fan is no art you gotta take it aside then it I take our state we're going to season it then pepper too much not too little some salt there you go and then we're going to sear mom shake in here we go cooking a proper thick steak it's when you sear you leave it in the pan and you don't touch it you count about a minute per side remember my fires at medium we're not too hot what a long see this smoke here this is perfect it's not too much something is burning not what we want so remember at the same time while this is searing we get season the other side of the steak here now you're going to ask me why a big cut of steak the reason is is when you pan fry it or when you do it on the grill it's going to keep its blood on the inside if you do do it in the steak dries up every time you're at home the other state will dry it up because it's too thin you can't let it rest you can't let the juice out on the steak you see here I want to touch it I really want to touch it but I'm not touching it if I touch it the sear it's not going to be perfect it's going to take another maybe 30 seconds the other reason why do I make it thicker cut like this to get more flavor all the fat and needles or revise that a male orientated different layers of flavor it's going to be super awesome all right we're about here one minute now remember at home you know what the pan make sure you check it's all right so we're about a minute everywhere now then we collected look at this here this is the calorie one you see all these fat years so caramelized here melting make it delicious thick this is what you want you are not for the fire too hot otherwise you're just going to throw the outside and then the inside won't because you're like wait you might stay cold why is it too rare while we're looking here for some medium-rare to medium the best way to you whereby give you a revised medium well but you're going to get tougher and tougher it's big design to be done like super well done or medium well done see again here some smoke coming up nothing about just a little layer smoke I want to touch it again I really want to touch it again but I'm not ready yet it's just going to wait maybe not 30 seconds and after that we're going to flip it on the side you can do fairly wet a little camera problem we're back here is only two seconds more so now our tier is almost ready so what we're going to do is grab the stake from under then we're going to sear the top layer of fat just hold it like this maybe 30 seconds 45 seconds we want to make all cheer properly awesome now the next step we're going to do step with the state run for a second  don't forgot to pick up the steak now we're going to let it rest on the grill there you go see that's yeah that's perfect so what we're going to do now we're going to let it rest for at least 6 minutes you can don't worry about letting rest too long 6 minutes 8 minutes 10 minutes is perfect we want to do is let the juice settle inside and then after that we're going to show you what to do after sits on 8 minutes catch you in a second our steak is here for about 7 to 8 minutes 48 minutes side now we can pull remember this fact we had before now we're going to crisp it very very hard so I got a pan here very odd we see smoking fire about media maybe a little bit more weight inside then  about 30 seconds what we want to do is make the Box all crispy it's like a Canadian bacon or or something like that so maybe my too much smoke you turn it out a little bit there you go yeah so like I was saying super crispy so in relation to your stay steady support and regulation get a piece of the fact that you would normally throw in the garbage or not each leave on the plate and then you know you gotta get this guy two different flavors out of it so I think we're about soon as they're ready just leave it there let it close the picture involve melting nice Swedish I can put this slide all right we're good here was this Oh  again we're gonna cover or another maybe 30 to 45 seconds it's a black operation near the sea under you another fan to finish the cook on the state and here I have half enough butter and water melted together the reason is is when we're going to put this in a band to stay back in a band we put just butter it's going to burn out if we do this the butter is not going to burn out and then we can reseal our steak finish with cooking gear but that's ready I also have shut off butter that we got to use after to fertilize the steak gonna give a super crisp super caramelized it's gonna be awesome  straight off rosemary FDM to give the final touch on tons of multi-layer in our stake very very simple I think we're about ready here right yeah so see the poppy here  beautiful and catalyzed here so Japan is still hot so we can prove this on the side here let's go inside here we're going to raise the volume the volume increase the temperature over here make it one like I said there's our butter and our water you got to drop it in the pan make sure the entire pan salt oil and then we're going to throw seem so I'm gonna grab it just bring it over totally drop the stake in when I raise the temperature  okay this is very class we're talking about 30 to 25 seconds  let's do that  as you can see my fans have smoking too much resist the urge of touching the stage don't touch it  I think that's okay don't touch nothing like I did about maybe another 20 seconds I think  make sure you got good ventilation  all right thank you  there you go  since I got my father's name  so the butter  bubbly now  then we plot arrives  then we're going to add our playroom  my dream don't  here we go there we go  there are no refunds I think we're about ready here  stop the fire we're then we've got to put it on the board here watch this just fantastic steak go get a grab it tonight  and my thumbs look at the color of it look at the beautiful and now I'm going to slice it just to show you what happened on the inside all right use per slice go let's slice again look at the interior of the state you see the layers of cooking inside that's a double cooking technique actually you see the outside is all nice and crisp the insides may be medium to a little bit more medium-rare tender it's not melting your foot so I'm going to wrap this off actually I'm gonna slice and I'm going to get it after something I can't you the second I'm shuffling everything and then I'll show it to you Thanks",

down the eight main feats performed by the great pyramids builders statement from which stem this movie feat number one before constructing the Great Pyramid the builders raised a hillock to the ground and left a giant pivot in its centre around this pivot they cut a six thousand hectare bedrock to fit weird shaped slabs each one as heavy as a big sedan despite its significance construction theories usually don't mention this first stage feed number two the builders had to carry 130 granite blocks over 500 miles each blog weighing between 12 and 70 tons then those blocks had to be hauled up 210 feet something which even today would be hard to do feat number three the Great Pyramid has only three chambers ridiculously small given the monuments size the lowest chamber the middle chamber and the upper chamber the Masons built a passageway that was 300 feet long by three feet wide board through the rocks with a breathtaking precision it opens on to the lowest chamber Pierluigi cope at an architecture took part in the berlin potsdamer platz building seemed surprised in courting the addition they intake the descending passageway being narrow the working conditions might have been drastic and keeping this constant slope angle requires specific tools to keep this same and precise geometry the mountain area gematria soon paused you would need tools that could allow this throughout the whole building process  feat number four that piled up more than two million stones of different shapes and sizes which is much harder than with similar blocks each block is as heavy as a sedan and the precision of the whole building matches modern day standards the upper chamber is perfectly horizontal and vertical and it's precision overshadows modern tolerances although a third of an inch off would have gone unnoticed the construction is precise to a fiftieth of an inch regarding the building's precision I talked to one of the best structure engineers on earth Chris wise to build things so accurately such a long time ago is it's frankly amazing and even now I think most people would say it would be too difficult for you know for most builders to to get anything like that accurate the Great Pyramid has stayed intact through at least three major earthquakes the last of which flattened Cairo in the 13th century and then the less everything is in place yeah and we've seen that nothing was moved inside  feed number five they have oriented the Great Pyramid so precisely that it's pointing north within five one hundredths of a degree this precision has only been matched very recently and to put things in context in the 17th century using the same methods we were five times less precise  feat number six something no construction theory mentions is that the Great Pyramid actually has eight sides since each one is slightly bent as you can see on this picture which complicates the structure since no two of those blocks are alike to keep this eight-sided base on the four sides of the edifice during the construction with an accuracy down to the centimeter even down to the millimeter would be very difficult extremely difficult and I think that if today we wanted to build the same structure using modern measuring and control devices the techniques available today we would definitely be in trouble feat number seven the Great Pyramid is supposed to been built in 20 years a quick calculation gives an idea of what that means construction wise for a 12-hour shift 365 days a year with at least two billion stone blocks that would mean one queried carved lifted and fitted block every two and a half minutes feet number eight since the builders came before the existence of wheels iron or steel it was with copper chisels stone mallets hemp ropes and a great deal of cleverness that they'd have built the last of the world seven wonders and the only one visible today let's sum up about 47 centuries ago when the rest of the planet is on the loose clad in animal skins mesons well building the Great Pyramid of Giza one limestone hillock razed to the ground a six thousand hectare paving over the face which she stand amount to six football fields over two million of piled up blocks for an estimated mass of 6.2 million tons a 42 story buildings hides a narrow 300 feet long passageway utterly straights driven through the rocks and running through the pyramids body 130 granite slabs lifted up to 210 feet and fitted to a 15th of an inch eight sides instead of four an outstanding earthquake proof structure a modern day like precision in the feeling a modern Lee like precision in the orientation and the whole thing in only 20 years with this put this way facts are confusing but that's what we need to keep in mind when we pass all over the Great Pyramid thanks to this contradiction I decided to take this file but I didn't know that it would take me ten years to close it and where it will lead me let's go back to square one when I was still thinking that Egyptology species were relying on actual and fruiting facts I was so far out so let's begin with the ancient empire when the Great Pyramid was built for Jolicloud probably the most qualified Egyptologist on earth the dates of Egyptian history can only be certified from 6-8 epc because that's when we managed to cross-check Egyptian archives with Roman and Greek ones before that it gets murky the differences could be give or take two hundred years although we assume that the Egyptologist is overwhelmed by archives this is true for some periods but but for others like the ancient empire somehow it's it's a big question mark and that's why finally your questions are ours when it comes to the pyramids construction we have a lot of ideas but no  central caps whose pyramid is allegedly stone we don't know for sure when nor how long this rain lasted compares for all Egyptian pharaohs we don't have any proper historical text  to get how complex it is picture yourself in front of it is working on blurry sometime conflicting chunks of staleys and papyrus written in a difficult language hundreds of thousands of years after the biggest building venture of mankind actually the situation is pretty easy to sum up lose Egyptologists are far from agreement and all that happened in an empirical way if you like with additions subtractions the thing is when it comes to the Great Pyramid we're left with assumptions and up to this day nothing has been proven yet so I naturally turned to geologists stone cutting specialists experienced engineers architects and big projects leaders to try to understand for instance here are among others to modern building sites which will help us to grasp the work scope of the Great Pyramid in the 60s 22 countries funded by 50 nations powering the leading-edge technology raised the abu simbel temple to keep it from being flooded by the Aswan Dam sporter in spite of cranes and trucks it took five years to quarry and rebuild this temple made of 2200 blocks the heaviest ones waiting 30 tones 2200 blocks 5 years 2 million blocks 20 years without cranes or trucks  the second side is a former click query currently filled with grubbles the pits volume is a bit smaller than the great pyramids do you know how long it took to fill up that pizza 12 years with one ruble truck every three minutes which means Aliev old trucks each business day only to carry and dump rubbles in the pits we're not talking size nor construction here's rompere Martin's take under construction of the Great Pyramid he hated one of the biggest French construction sites and mila by addicted swung whether you believe in God and in aliens or you may imagine any kind of setup or like me you want to keep it down to earth believing only in men and asking yourself how he did it I have no clue I couldn't do it that's for sure physically it would be so much easier to extend the construction span of the Great Pyramid the building of the temple to work on pyramid in Mexico half as tall lasted 150 years why do we chipped ologist stick to this silly 20-year period of time because if they acknowledge a span outlasting caps ring the tomb alibi would collapse and that's undisputable here's the mainstream stand only law for a long time there was some hearsay not from Egyptologist I'd like to stress but there was some hearsay alleging that pyramids could have had another function see that is unthinkable if it wasn't kept stone what could it be challenging this first table with this simple question would make you feel in the eyes of an Egyptologist like appear immediately translates into a loony I have to tell you something if it wasn't for a guide an outstanding tireless persistent researcher I would still be wandering around it told me to check other sides as old as the Great Pyramid and others more ancient and it turned out to be a precious tip everywhere I saw this weird shape blocks why those shapes it's much easier to fit similar blocks as we do nowadays you just have to lay them side by side without carving them up onto the visa for me this remains a complete mystery also given that they've been set so CMOS without cement these are rough stones laid side by side this is breathtaking these are tremendous feats a razor blade couldn't penetrate between two blocks we can even spot some rounded blocks and the upper stone fits perfectly the curve which is very hard with stones as heavy as twenty pickup trucks heavy blocks like that weren't put back in place anytime recently the finished shaped blocks find their explanation in this also I feel that they were saving material since it was transported from a great distance  so they did that out of a concern for saving material which makes sense since we reshape as less as possible what's from the query especially if it's 500 miles away what would we do today I asked Filippo bare head of one of the biggest granite cutting company in France available on campaigner sheet and we would start with a plan in order to define each piece precisely hold you the check then we would produce each piece and afterwards reshape them to make sure that they fit together with machines sure but with bare hands we don't know since we never did it again with such stones since we never did it again how could we know it was possible then I was shown this here the fitting structure reflects itself on each side of the passageway here and there  same thing over here and over there this was a serious blow to the common idea that blocks were set as the cane it showed quite the opposite a will to order and reshape stones to create those strange figures because we're shaping blocks as hard as tempered steel with those tools and moving them without cranes to make them fit has never been done again except in Egyptology small fetish drawings what sense to make of those weird shapes that complicated the test so bad Wow I mean if you want your monument to stand strong looking it needs to be heterogeneous in its dimension the mania has to cool that will keep the wall from collapsing in the case of stress like in an earthquake neon pardhu since there are no modular blocks there are no crack lines thus the block suit each other which makes a robust wall india building that way enables to withstand earthquakes and the most obvious proof is that the Great Pyramid is still around if this really was the function of those shapes it meant that builders knew it which leads to the next question how could they know it since anti size missile requires modern equipment Higgins here sums up the situation pretty well from my ground observations each time I check the pyramid spot systematically everything had to be reconsidered monkey steel I put my questions in hold for a while thinking that ancient builders just enjoyed making the simple complicated for example the Great Pyramids eight sides when four would have been so much easier to build especially if they're useless as we assume useless not that sure as you're about to see but for this we need to go back to pre-world War to Cairo [Music] all hypo Shah who in the 30s was teaching math in Cairo got this amazing picture taking randomly one night by the Royal Air Force during the autumnal equinox it showed the south side of the pyramid split into one in the dark the other in the light this is only due to the side span when the Sun reaches the pyramids angles for just a few seconds the south side gets played into and this phenomenon occurs only twice a year during the equinoctial days when the Sun rises Far East on hi-potion will double-check this with three infrared snapshots on March 21st 1934 if you get the pyramid into an architecture software its shape its dimensions and if you enter its geography coordinates precisely then you will also see this phenomenon occurring during the equinoxes in push sometimes some argue that the pyramids casing was already gone and that it in beginning as you can see under khafre's pyramid the side wasn't bent which is true except that the khafre's pyramid isn't bent beneath its casing so we say then we say that these bands in the red pyramid side were not intentional but that was not made on purpose sit down there was an accident very minor by the way due to the monuments structure in other words its sheer accidents during the construction the pyramid would have weighed down in provoking this band that would have been covered by a flat casing then when this casing fell apart the pyramid just happened to signal equinoxes here is a professionals input it's it's inconceivable to me that it would break its back in one direction and also in another direction at right angles you know to break us up into four and that's not a natural behavior you could imagine it breaking into two but nothing if that was the case the building structure would have been all messed up something visible from the inside with cracks everywhere it was certainly intentional it was certainly the architects choice today some still argue and in spite of this fold in the structure that the outer casing was quite flat using as a proof a few blocks on the north side of the pyramid which are not bent the problem is that obviously those blocks are not at the original place because if we stretch their trajectories we hit the upper blocks which shouldn't happen if according to specialists the side spans were intentional and if they were signaling equinoxes we could fairly think that it was for this reason that the construction was so complicated of course not a single Egyptologist would acknowledge that because it would imply that building the Great Pyramid at this specific location with those precise shapes and dimensions would produce this phenomenon during the equinoxes which is hard to explain given the basic tools they had at the time inadvertently I hate Egyptology second to who the builders dueling close to the Great Pyramid there's a black bedrock and makeshift picnic table for tourists that doesn't get much attention to such an extent that if you start to shoot there your rouse police's suspicion meanwhile here's what a trained eye to snatch rough and polished parts grooves striations cats  those images haunted me until the day when I accidentally ran into this rock cut by modern tools a few years ago and although 5000 years separated those two works the match was staggering later on other Egyptian sites from the same period I was shown those holes you might ask yourself what's up with them well then match the ones we do today with that kind of device except that they're connect and the feature grooves that's so far nobody has explained or reproduced but basic means when we start to have questions on the tooling sooner or later we run into Egyptian handcraft the one I was interested in was the oldest big small the finishing is perfect even when they're made of stones harder than steel they didn't have at a time do you know how many were found 40,000 beneath the Saqqara pyramid when the Egyptian civilization started [Music] when I try to understand the way they were made I was passed on the next magical drawing did we try to reproduce those objects with the same techniques no we thought it wasn't worth it when I heard that the Louvre had analyzed them I took advantage of my interview to slip in that question here's what I got well regarding the analysis of the inner verses we dealt with the content but not the technical part we haven't worked on the techniques used in animal pathologies neither them nor anybody else knowing that such face was filled with honey or milk seemed anecdotal to me when I was wondering how 40,000 perfect pieces could have been made right out of the Stone Age I flew right away to the Aspen quarry where the red granite for the Great Pyramid could be found this curved thing is the unfinished obelisk [Music] 126 feet tall for 1,300 tones that's a 15 story building waiting 850 pickup trucks and plus then I wondered how they queried and transported it I hope my question back fearing another small drawing but I got lucky I saw the tools and even tried them here again a trained eye discovers weird stuff this and this and this again those are technical shafts openings which were used for manufacturing so they were met with that when we know the work lot when one uses a stone bulb why such a carryin the finishing of common technical openings let's move on with gigantic stuff the ecology of memnon are probably the heaviest statues in the world the usual mass estimation is 1,300 tons the Troy Hagen's hates 1,800 nobody carried all lifted such heavy statues ever since it was the only known example on the planet out of patience I dared the question that would tag me as a heretic could we be sure that it was possible to handle the statues with ropes in wood I would say yes the proof is here so indeed we can do it that says it all good it's all right here you just have to look everything became clear all this had been made with simple means since it was there and it was built at the time when we only used simple means so the fact that it was there proved that it was possible to do it with simple means  why didn't anyone ever think of other means because machines were off the table and why because that's what we thought there was no archive recording the way they built we had no proof that those things were built according to those allegations but we were sticking to them Egyptology is him to have trapped itself in its own beliefs and suspected anyone out of the line to crave for sensations but who's eager for sensations aren't they those who pretend that the Great Pyramid was delivered in 20 years then I heard of the PBS's Nova experienced the proof by the making in 1991 this American TV show wanted to duplicate the Great Pyramid using the alleged means of the past professor David Ovitz who was there gave us those pictures little bit more the coding was built with modern manual tools a they all had butt joints one-centimeter joints surveen PF field hall a stone at a 5 feet reach took them about 10 hours wavy they told me well you see at the beginning it took some time but once they get experienced they'll work much faster despite what Nova claimed in a documentary where this even was portrayed as a success is a fiasco and this Fiasco has become a touchstone in the books of geology the pyramid will never be achieved and a few years later collapsed as long as we stick to a theoretical debate we'll come up with every option Under the Sun it all depends on our will to open up to a different technology it's up to the way we look  here are the most Encana clips ever seen this picture is genuine and hasn't been retouched  how to explain those cliffs isn't that an obvious proof of Technology  well no Mystics might see them as a sign of times but the thing is it's a startling coincidence those are two overlaid for our names Sethi and his son Ramesses to the layer was aged over his father's name decades later then as time went by the plaister came off and brought to light those stunning lives since Egyptologist keeps Highland some people use those pictures for their chilling effects  if there's one thing I can be sure of its that a picture will never prove anything but sometimes they're disturbing as we're about to see any and clear artifact is believed to be religious so here are some sacrificial basins a religious altar a religious scenery and a lotus flower vase we rarely see those items in books no wonder this one is in the Cairo Museum yes it's a lotus flower vase it bothers because we can't really explain them frankly although I have nothing else to suggest I can't think of this as a base and in the spot where the flower is supposed to lay is pierced matching hundreds of experts here's Alan Andrews take a scientist turn leading edge engineer over 40 years ago they might think of something as a sculpture or a religious totem whereas an engineer or scientist would recognize it as a piece of a machine I just begged the archaeologists please let engineers let scientists come in and help you analyze what the function that these devices are I then turned to the numerous engineers who were questioning the tools used and the methods during this new quest I met Christopher Dunn an expert engineer in the manufacturing of high-precision machines for military aviation and his stunning study of luksus giant statues in Egypt puzzling over the forty five feet tall granite statues he came up with the technicians point of view the Ramses statue that looks or are incredible in their design they're incredible in their execution these are very very complex shapes and so we're going to look at just how complex are they surprised by the boggling symmetry of ramesses to space he processed to a photogrammetry analyzes in other words he has duplicated the picture turned it over and overlaid it with the original to match the left and white sides what we see is that this jawline and this jaw line are in fact that is unbelievable to create the condition where one side matches the other they had to have had some system of measure to be able to make sure that they were cutting the material properly and there they were achieving the geometry that they desired this is not the result of somebody going at a piece of granite with a chisel and chiseling a face out and saying okay that looks like a human face this kind of condition does not happen by accident as we see you can district describe a circle that actually conforms to the outline of the face but now you've got to remember that that circle is in 2d but the jaw jawline is coming forward in 3d so it's very complex geometry and the same on the other side and now we'll start to look at the other features of the face the eyebrows lower eyelid upper eyelids the lips and the proximate curve to the mouth same thing for the side we can use circles again to describe those features and all the circles that were used here are the same diameter and it's not the only statue to feature that symmetry other heads also have the same share metrics game the tool issue is significant of course but there might be an even more important question what was guiding the tool because the human hand is not that precise so it had to have assistance and today we have mechanical assistance the guy tools to cut complex shapes and contours what I present in and telling you about the precision of the objects is just to represent the facts of an engineer what I have measured in terms of who did it why they did it and when it was done other specialists need to answer those questions Linda confusion one of the confusions that gets into people's minds when they visit Egypt when they discover and look carefully at the relief sculptures the hieroglyphs translate into a very fresh remark they didn't have our machines we know the instrument good name so this tree Maas were abrasive tools working slowly but surely a lot more brutally metamour the material was hard to work like granite for example the more the stone chiseling of the Carver sculpted was taking care of this was part of the relationship between the realm of man and the realm of the gods time could explain the need polish of a statue but not a symmetry accurate down to one hundred seven inch impossible to be measured with the alleged tools 45 feet tall granite statues thoroughly symmetric I was baffled by the consequences of such discovery it seemed harder and harder to top that manufacturers used in advanced technology but it was so disturbing that I would have bought anything else when I was passed on another small detail drawing I got upset the person who order that drawing hadn't done his homework nobody can determine what tools we use we can theorize but essentially when theorizing we have to show we have to be able to demonstrate the tool question had to be reconsider thoroughly but I didn't have much hope given diehard prejudices  stuck in this dead-end I turned back to the search I met he showed me this amazing picture I was stunned to see that so far away from Egypt the Sam stone setting applied [Music] if I were an archaeologist I would have advised him to take some time off because no ties between those locations were possible but I'm not and I will certainly be reminded of it a bit later I left for a small island hardly visible on the map but nonetheless very famous Easter Island Easter Island is the most isolated spot in the world it is 2,300 miles away from Chile and 2,500 miles from Terry this triangular island with a 12 mile base isn't a bare stone that I expected the climate is tropical and it's very green with white sand beaches herds of wild horses and three huge craters two of whom are filled with water which reveals an intense volcanic activity million years ago the moai name given to these statues were from that volcanic rock here's a digest of the usual version the past ones were descendants of a group of Polynesians who after 2,500 miles pirogue trip settled in an island they named Rapa Nui the world's bellybutton here again we are only left with maybes because science count data rocks carving except in some rare cases dated geologically I get some granite I put it in the geological context and from there I'll say it took as many millions or even billions of years to get this granite ooh and my job as a geologist ends there something I didn't know we can only date the edge of a rock but not when it's been carved according to archeologists this is the oldest wall in the island actually the pedestal over which the statues were set apparently here to the most ancient constructions are the most massive with the best fitting  hundreds of my are scattered around this immense volcano their height ranging from 15 to 36 feet  here is the biggest a sixty six feet tall baby and had it been achieved would have awaked two hundred and fifty tones  as for the unfinished Aspen obelisk we can question how they plan to query it transport it and then hold it up low current theory can explain such a statute transportation the same goes for the many hundred tons and plus mu I which have been displaced without any problems I'm not saying that it's impossible but so far nobody repeated this feat and the biggest more I used in a check-up experience was weighing less than five tones the central mu I weighs over sixty tones and sits nine miles away from the query the usual explanation goes like this if it works for five tones it works for one hundred nonetheless in the real world engineers and technicians speak with one voice carrying statues weighing 100 tons over several miles and set them on a pedestal his Quietus terms here again the transportation and set issues had to be addressed although my are always facing the land this set of statue is for some reason the only one in the aisle in gazing at the sea and more precisely facing west the seven pairs of eyes are watching the horizon of the equinoctial sunset which is not surprising since the navigation skill of those people reveals a great astronomical knowledge the last Island's mystery is the writing not yet deciphered one heretic theory identifies it to the mohenjo-daro sites cliffs through the surprising similarity of some science the problem is that this side happens to be 12,500 miles away if we were not that far from Giza we could think that those two peoples communicated which could explain their common features but also since they face the same problems it's very likely that their feelings matched because as some archaeologists put it although they don't know each other all the peoples of the world build the same dams  why did Polynesians decide one day to live what matter to them most land family friends to venture on a Pyrrhic trip a perilous journey that would take them 2,500 miles away what were they up to  how about dozen Kenney statues which don't look like Poli nations aquiline noses thin lips high foreheads beards and why such hens carving builders handsome I will be confirmed that similar feelings to Vienna poos could be found in Peru instigate a number who goddess I think that in those two sites the stonework developed amazingly insects highwayman as well as Vina Fuu are among the greatest examples nomads to the various it came we couldn't say who influenced who or that we have been swayed by the Inca people even those questions to archaeology I left for Peru  [Music]  there was this curious giant drawing called the GL glyph not much is known about it some pretend that it's less than a hundred years old other that it's been here forever but since dating is impossible bids are open it's 549 feet long and it's precisely oriented north house by who how and why this face was carved here nobody knows  my next stop was Nazca and it's curious giant drawings this 15 by 12 mile plateau has been discovered in 1926 while flying the region those Jo glyphs and patterns have been ascribed to the Nazca civilization between 500 BC and 750 ad although those giant drawings of animals were executed in a single stroke what impressed me the most for these immense shapes [Music]  and those perfectly straight lines the longest stretching up to 13 miles to give you an idea of the size the small row that you can see is the pan-american and the tiny things are trucks from the ground no drawings are visible not even from the neighboring Hills it can only be seen from the sky I dare the question what's the use of them to quantify the amount of thread for a fabric that were probably trails or they were used for processions because archaeologists say those lines were drawn to walk on it didn't seem bothering to have nothing more convincing in store not far from Nazca a pyramid had been discovered and I heard that there might be 40 of them but the site was hardly explored due to lack of phones a few miles away at the ECAM Museum I was surprised to discover mummies elsewhere than in Egypt and also those misshapen skulls similar to that one ascribed to a Canadian an Egyptian pharaoh then I headed to Cusco which in Inca means the world's bellybutton like Rapa Nui Easter Islands named in the heart of the city we find this gold made the huge blocks two generations of walls the oldest ones and the most recent as in most constructions ascribed to the Inca people this wall we stood earthquakes and so did the saqsaywaman side which towers the city and which is often compared to the Viner Pooh's wall in Easter Island this time we get gigantic whole rocks set with an extreme precision that we can't explain you shouldn't underestimate how much effort is involved in preparing the surfaces of each of the blocks  despite the fact that Peru is a place where earthquakes are very very common many many structures built far later with modern technology vanished into dust and these stones are still standing according to Malcolm Rabello an Indian searcher this side with cusco and another sacred site Kenko forms a perfect triangle I couldn't explain with certainty these coincidental metric distances with other sites on the world specifically distances in hectometer x' or kilometers but the proof is there so there might be a source the following name on my list was Orient I tumbled located and more than 1200 miles I started to get used to it the most ancient constructions where the most receive and the stone feelings the most complex how was it possible to leave those rocks on such a steep slope nowadays we could live this stones of 10 tons to a reach of maybe 50 metres into a height of 100 meters with very large cranes but I mean that's a huge piece of contemporary technology what's amazing about it is that we couldn't do it now and this was 500 years ago if you imagine Egyptians then I hope the train to machu picchu a magical spot [Music] on door most of these examples when we visit Machu Picchu we get a sense of how sophisticated was the Andean civilization sophistication que el Puebla and I know tanea in the people over all the cusco valleys inhabitants didn't know what much who Peter was about what you people this site was meant to be a hidden side of knowledge transmission there I saw what became familiar the most ancient constructions since covered by others where the most mercy with the best feeding but what surprised me the most was this this wall angle was perfectly matching those found on the Giza Plateau and there too we found the same reflections in the fading lets run things down on all those sides we find very heavy blocks with complex shapes assembled with an extreme precision astronomical skills alleged dating and most of all known indication on construction needs  that's where the comparison with the Beavers balls through because even if they build the same dams they don't line them up over thousands of miles fewer Charles Darwin and you were thinking about the history of evolution you would look at these examples of stonework and masonry and you would say either it's one evolutionary stream the same stream in which case these people all knew about each other's work even though they were separated by thousands of years or you would say there are four parallel streams of evolution going on damage the homo sapiens is the same all over the world it's obvious that certain problems they face will get the same number and quality advantageous to divorce forget to get the same answer with four parallel streams makes it to me's seems very unlikely it's hard to imagine that the Incas weren't anywhere near Egypt I found that a bit hard to believe and if they communicated which is more likely how could they line up their sides so precisely and why this 30 degree incline from our equator putting that question on hold I headed to Mexico  [Music] the legend tells us that the gods met here to create the fifth son Ezrin Giza we find three main pyramids two big ones and a smaller one the Sun pyramid the moon pyramid and the feathered snake Quetzalcoatl pyramid here we're more rational than in Egypt for instance the Sun pyramids construction is supposed to have lasted 150 years since it's not viewed as a tomb but once again when it comes to techniques and means we're clueless locusts 13 reo escape what is amazing is that the Sun pyramid and many other constructions have been built to indicate precisely what we call equinoxes my Informer tip me on another pyramid sites ignored from the public it was located in central China in the Shanxi Province axion [Music] in this most ancient people region of China we can see hundreds of pyramids made of clay and dirt the Chinese Authority is declined to lick anything on those pyramids no archaeologists seem willing to talk about them the topic is a non-starter  I couldn't get any authorization to check this side but I met Hartwig hausdorff who in 1994 brought those pictures back apparently the only one featuring those last pyramids  although we found hundreds of them each pyramid represents a tremendous work but we don't know when by who how and why they were erected  it's always been my think that I'm the only wine to have been granted by the Chinese authorities not the right to shop those pyramids that's the reason why I felt it was my duty to document their existence for the whole world here again the mystery Co zone [Music] as in Mexico and Egypt manufacturers didn't leave any explanation yes favi damn horse it would be senseless to try to look for ties or cultural exchange between different times and different places of humanity he doesn't settle your mood Egypt developed way before Mexico and there was no relationship whatsoever between North Africa and this part of America secure it's funny that Egypt whose writing is hieroglyphics China whose characters are also close to hieroglyphics and even more complex or the Mayan culture it also has a hieroglyphics kind of writing they built this kind of signal monument but it doesn't work for Mesopotamia so it's a mere coincidence because most writings must start with an expression of reality we find many other common points between all the sites but the main ones are confusing enough a gyro glyph a core idea graphic writing but is mummification calendars designers great astrological skills earthquake proof constructions no indication over the means and the intention behind those realizations [Music]  [Music]  to the premise of a main source to those civilizations were objected that those constructions occurred at different times let's keep in mind that monuments can be dated only organic remains found nearby there were no records for those common constructions challenging more than engineer skills one question popped in my mind did those people really build as monuments yeah nothing proves to us that these smooth sided pyramids weren't secondhand monuments used by Egyptians I'm a scientist so it's not easy for me to say that  we're at the dissin thai seismic knowledge come from we've made a great deal of progress in that science when we managed to simulate powerful shocks with Dynamite's coming of age but without them how does it work how could we explore dirt pyramids if we swap them with trees it doesn't make sense here's what might happen a few decades from now and what they might look like who will know that these were once pyramids we don't pay attention to those architectural feats that we could barely reproduce today any material the man mankind hasn't managed to invent a single material waste blasts as well as this stuff it's amazing but we haven't been here I assume that you're waiting to trade me up well I was like you when I opened this file but I've discovered that between what we're told and archaeology's backstage there's a whole world when an archaeologist dares to venture out of the beaten tracks he can't get any fun for his research the most enigmatic sights of the planet are not properly investigated and this situation leaves open the gateway to all kinds of abuse but if these mysteries were solved you wouldn't watch this movie  [Music]  as long as we won't be able to date a rock scaring we won't have any certainties despite these evidence if scientists refuse to consider other hypotheses then science won't be about science but about belief to understand this mystery we need to start from scratch and sweep away those beliefs I came back to my file Easter Island the para caste channel Aska cuzco saqsaywaman oriental tambo machay picchu and Giza are lined up still to account Giza and chauncey are lined up if Giza the most central point on earth is indeed a crucial piece of this gigantic puzzle that's where we need to go back indeed case I will shed a light on everything at this stage of the investigation I came back to one still impressed by the symmetry of the Luxor statues my journey gave me enough insight to build a brother freely all kinds of hypotheses it's in such state of mind that I came back to the searcher who was guiding mein Egypt and then sent me all over the world I quickly got that he knew much more on the matter and little by little he turned into a real informant  sometime in the course of our many meetings I felt I was adrift but I had a hunch that something outstanding was lying underneath unfortunately I kept at it  it all started in Egypt not very far from Giza at the foot of the Red Pyramid ascribed to Sneferu Cheops father here's what we call a pure immediate this is the pyramid scalp this one was discovered by the German Egyptologist Avinash tatelman in 1993 and my informant took me there to shoot it in 2005 the measurements taken by straddle man and the ones we took were precisely 1 meter 57 for its base and one meter for its height the hub is reassemble distance and its dimensions were precisely one meter by one point five seven meters it was surprising to state that it was precisely one meter high is exactly Egyptians knew many things that we inherited not the metric system of course but we can't think that the estimate was roughly two cubits that was enough for the stonecutter that would mean that it was accidentally one meter high because we know that the meter unit wasn't known at the time actually it would be more accurate to say that we believe it wasn't known at the time I'll get back to the layer for now I would like to report something to you when I came back to shoot it in 2008 I was stunned to discover this the pyramidion had been changed it was a very intrigued because here we have let's be honest at reason of the form of the objects function there were no grounds for this item to take this shape since they invented it why we have absolutely no idea not only the shape had changed but also its dimensions which was much more important because as you're about to see this object plays a central part in the comprehensions of the Giza sides first I have to backtrack a bit to the time when my informant advised me to gather information on what had been said about the Great Pyramid Egyptology was often accusing all ternary searchers of lacking rigor but I discovered that Egyptologist failed to precise a few things about their source the possibility I think that you should check that kind of text for instance who heard of this controversy reported 20 centuries ago by the Roman historian Pliny the Elder 12 major writers from his time were having discrepancies over the real builders of the pyramids but how many texts were still around just one hero terraces [Music] Egyptology was mainly relying on Herodotus account but how much credit to give to that version centuries later in 1859 the Englishman John teller divided this dimension by this one and was surprised to discover the pi value this sparked another controversy because builders were not meant to know pi some sir God's hands and others an accident but no one thought that manufacturers might have known this number this controversy seemed to me a bit inappropriate because I wasn't getting that teller had hit a nerve instead of answering my questions my informant took his maquette back and said that in order to apprehend the Great Pyramid one had to think differently why this dimension Oscar because the hath perimeter is the biggest horizontal visible dimension and its height its biggest vertical invisible dimension he maintained that nothing was random in the Great Pyramid and confirmed it with the structures harmony the visible height divided by two gives the chevron summit of the upper chamber divided by three you get the height of the upper chamber sailing by for the Chevron summit in the middle chamber by five the floor in the lowest chamber and by seven the floor in the middle chamber then he showed me that the biggest visible surface the four faces divided by its biggest invisible surface the base equals Phi the famous golden number I already heard of the golden number but I didn't know much about it I discovered that it was unique among the infinite numbers it's the only one to feature those worthy questions the golden number plus one equals the golden number squared the golden number minus one equals the inverse golden number [Music] thus it occurred in an astronomical calculation in minerals natural angles in vegetables animals and although some disagreed it was even featured in men as Leonardo da Vinci showed and it was in art too actually it was part of our daily life although we didn't know it the new golden number appears to be a constant in the universe but my informant showed me that it was widespread in the Great Pyramid on his own by dividing the half perimeter about the total height we get the golden number squared garden so these divided by the visible height equals PI and this divided by the total height gave the golden numbers derivative if we assume that the PI presence was due to chance it got harder with two numbers but here again I was wrong I decided to check the official dimensions of the Great Pyramid for 40 by 280 cubits the royal cubit being the unit of measurement used by the builders if all agree on the great pyramids dimensions this quartz exists on the precise cubits value first we don't know where it comes from a nice actual size we just found a few made of wood or stone with different lengths so experts deduced it from the great pyramids dimensions and precisely set its length in 1925 52 centimeters 3 millimeters and 6 tenths of a millimeter sometimes we pass by things without really paying attention to them and I didn't notice that this cubit was precise to the tenths of a millimeter when we're dealing with a huge building it would be like measuring the content of a swimming pool with a jigger later other well reputed experts confirm that dimension follow where a french egyptologist it measured 52 centimeters 35 as for the Greek astronomer antonia d k cell highway engineer turn Egyptologists validate 52 centimeters 3 millimeters and 6 tenths of a millimeter  donkey ups and key ups we can tell from the sizes of the rooms that the cubit is 0.5 to 3 5 curiously nowadays the mainstream point of view diverged drastically we found a great number of qubits which was the measurement tool itself but their values range rather loosely between 52 and 53 centimeters to use those changing values to draw conclusions on irrational numbers sounds to me very hazardous actually getting different measurements from one object to another is no big deal since it's the great pyramids qubit that matters and it can be defined precisely in the upper chamber since it's been made out of granite a material so steady over time that in our current hi-tech days we use it to check the precision of delicate parts why this shift over a few decades because we'd rather downplay such an unexplained high-precision standard when the rest of the planet runs around in animal skins among all the questions to were hunting me first why such a precise qubit in a to 30 meter long side / 146 meter high building [Music] and how to precisely fit together such heavy stones  but a critical comment came from Christopher Dunn these are the tools that are necessary to determine the precision on the artifacts these are modern tools these tools do not exist in the archaeological record so the builders would have worked with a precision that they were not able to check because they didn't have the proper tools to do it like the luksus granite statues whose symmetry could only be measured by modern means that was a huge contradiction to which my informants answered that this precision was in the cubed pick only for mathematical reasons something that no one seemed to have noticed if we draw a circle with a diameter of 1 then the circles perimeter or its length equals PI over 3 1416 dividing this length by 6 we get 0 52-36 a number surprisingly close to the cubed value what's left in green equals the golden number squared featured in the quake pyramid as my informant already showed me according to him here is how they chose to cube it although I don't feel comfortable with math I strive to stick to him to see where he was heading a bit later he showed me why the shape of the Great Pyramid was so special a square the square center and by shifting that points Heights we could draw all the square based pyramids but a circle was needed to draw the Great Pyramid a circle whose lengths was matching the squares that was the circles radius and if we lifted it like that we got the precise height of the Great Pyramid he added that this outstanding mathematical template was the only one to gather pi and the golden number this length divided by the visible height involves eyes divided by the invisible surface equals the whole denoted by this one equals golden invited by this one equals the square wave at all times one also equals the square root of the golden number I stopped him what if all this was due to chance it was unthinkable because that dimension which wasn't part of the pyramid shape also came up with the golden number and it was also the case with the upper chambers dimensions actually the visible pyramid the upper chamber and the total height were playing with the pine number or the golden number which seemed intentional that's why I could assert that the pine number and the golden number were everywhere in the pyramid  I left a bit dizzy thinking of testing cars words an American engineer specialized in nanotechnologies who one day also told me any detail that we see was intentional on the part of the designer and on the part of the builders and there was nothing left to chance the most striking thing was that this precision in the plan and in its realisation could only be detected with modern tools at complete odds with the mainstream viewpoint schools don't what we get in the plan of the Great Pyramids floor what we get in its cut in its volume we can expect to find it in the shape the volume the diagonals of the funeral chambers that's quite normal since they use the same if this dimension was also playing with the golden number it was just a matter of that kind of thing affair we can make such amazing discoveries with the kitchen stools Libya if it's well proportioned and well designed yet we might very likely come up with very interesting proportions intimately but don't put any secret purpose or interpretation in these arithmetic and geometric values to put it differently still and always chance this is her passion from our calculations it's very unlikely that Egyptians knew the high value of the point initially the golden number was also a relative unit featured in the pyramids and their temples in Peres meeting and it occurs in the Egyptian calculations and so this knowledge is very unlikely under here in Bahrain actually mathematics skills of ancient Egyptians our Egyptologist third taboo they constantly attribute to chance any mathematical fine because if they admitted that it was intentional they'd have to explain many other things that don't fit the usual theory but could it be a matter of chance I asked the question to Claude ganz link to tell Monsieur wrong we meet it so often that chance probability is new it's - fantasy most me frankly he commits like zero it stands to reason even for a mathematician he not meeting someone who can assess probability it's reasonable to think that the volume of that pyramid was picked because of its numerous possibilities to reveal through it a golden number out of Egyptology spree Emmerich Jonah Claude told me this I think that ancient Egyptians were aware of the golden number they couldn't have come across the resolution each time especially this perfect one they had to possess that it's not in their culture to divulge it they kept it secret and the best way to keep a secret is not to convey it anywhere but why is secret I didn't quite get my informants answer an episode it's no secret it's simply closed geometry which is the sensible part of mathematics is a language in consoler mathematics hanging out with architects made me discover that we often spot the golden number in our past architecture for example in Greece the Parthenon was built on a golden number base geometry then the cathedrals on which so much things have been Sayed we build 200 of them over 250 years but no construction plan nor indications were left startling parallel with the pyramids and over antiquities buildings and by studying them some would discover amazing things like this circle indicating precisely descent position on the horizon during the equinoctial days new coincidence even cathedrals were indicating equinoxes like ancient constructions then this architect showed me that the great pyramids actual profile was featured on the facade of the strasbourg cathedral the thing is that when this Cathedral was built the Great Pyramid was still partially buried in sin and we couldn't know its actual profile if it wasn't by chance it meant that medieval architects knew the Great Pyramids golden ratio but how we shouldn't be surprised those geometric and arithmetic features have been bought back to be used in cathedrals and medieval times from the Crusades and from contacts made there I was quite surprised over 4000 years were separating cathedrals from pyramids and it seemed unlikely that such knowledge got secretly transmitted passing by the famous Louvre pyramid I remember that its proportions match the great pyramids although its dimensions were changing from one source to another tomato Ming pay its architect hasn't been a cakewalk but I finally got a chance to question the architect of the great pyramids replicas I don't know why you keep referring this pyramid to the diesel the entirely different is something that comes naturally yes that is the right proportion that's all right hi I'd never use mathematics anymore I couldn't believe it mister pay was claiming that he came across the same ratio on a hunch eventually shared this the proportion of the pier-glass theorem and the proportion Giza very close why the golden section of Golden Triangle that they have investigated them is still to me valid today and I tried many shape many height but eventually I come back to thee he called the proportion of the Egyptian that's wonderful to learn you know the golden number he saw it in the Great Pyramid and knew that it was the common point with ease but somebody came to remind him that he had an appointment with his physician and he left me stranded with my questions time went by and nothing had changed we were still building pyramids without feeling like talking about their design the more I dug this case the less I knew where I was stepping into then my informant took the pyramids dimension issue to the next level way beyond what he already showed me this length in meters and he insisted on that world minus the height in meters gives 314 point 16 meters or 100 times pi this Plus this in meters evens 100 times the golden number squared in meters this in meters minus this in meters evens 10 times pi in meters if the Great Pyramid had been built 50 centimeters smaller or bigger all of that couldn't have been possible same thing in the upper chamber this length in meters is 10 times pi in meters minus this one 10 times the golden number squared in meters had the upper chamber been five centimeters bigger or smaller once again all this couldn't have been possible the startling conclusion is that only one pyramid in the world features all what you've seen the one which has been realized a Great Pyramid of Giza [Music] if the pyramid was already special through its ratio it became unique with its metric dimensions and here my informant was addressing a serious issue because historically this was a non-starter the builders couldn't know the mirror it was determined by a precise calculation of the circumference of the earth van was applied in 1793 following a suggestion of Tally Ho who as I discovered was a bishop where did our mirror come from was it discreetly transmitted over the years that question propyl main the blurry and winding waters of secret Brotherhood's withholding some occult knowledge trickled down over time I wasn't feeling comfortable I took a break tired of not knowing where my informant was taking me but I couldn't quit without answers eventually I dropped by his place and he showed me a picture of the modified Pierrot median I then discovered what was right under my nose for a long time it featured not only the mirror since it was 1 meter high but it was also giving PI emitters since 1 meter 57 plus one mirror 57 s equals 3 meters 14 or PI emitter he added that he was surprised that no one spotted this thing the pyramidion was a Great Pyramid scale model even its discoverer hadn't noticed it  actually it was probably the great pyramids cap that was never found but what was it doing 20 kilometers away from Giza at the foot of another pyramid and why having changed its shape then my informant showed me this these lengths Woodworth won without mentioning any length unit so it could be anything but if we assume that it was 1 meter we could precisely get the qubit value in meter it took me a while to grasp the magnitude of that discovery but it seemed indisputable the builders need a meter way before us what made him sure of that was a simple calculation freezing the others I was baffled I was witnessing firsthand the how and the why of this enigmatic Cupid question that so far no one answered fortunately that was my last math class but I was far from guessing what was next he enfold a map saying Linea Kiba strip that stretches from Easter Island to Giza is actually part of a 25,000 mile long circular loop all the lengths of our Equator are in reality of course there are no faraway ties nor light years away ties there's nothing to say no comment to make moreover such a stretch that would link Easter Island and the Egyptian pyramids this is a roughly 100 kilometer wide circle and it covers as you're about to see many sites around the globe [Music] it goes through Peru and the para cast chandalier the Nazca tracks or on Titan go Machu Picchu Cusco and saksaywaman then still in Peru through the side of the parrot or a pyramid  on the African continent it reaches Mali and its enigmatic Duggan's lands which knew the star Sirius B and C way before any astronomers passes through Algeria and the Tassili n'ajjer with his big painted Martian guard in Egypt it goes through the CYO aces and it serves amman temple one of the most sacred of the antique world then through the Giza pyramids it keeps coming through Petra in Jordan or in Iraq where Abraham was born Persepolis in Iran mohenjo-daro in Pakistan with his riding so close to Easter islands and it's odd radioactive skeletons then through size that have always been known as God's dwelling places cattle era in India PA in Burma sukhothai in Thailand Angkor Wat and pretty air in Cambodia and other important sites lost along the way from the ancient world and history to end with the most isolated spot on earth Easter Island it was unbelievable but this sites alignment was GPS certified although those sites were from different times most were built over ancient sites runes but how did they determine in such remote times these sites along such a long strip that crosses the seas why these sites alignments on a circle as long as the equator and with a 30-degree incline but there was even more surprising if this circle was an equator its North Pole would be located at this specific point and the triangle formed by this point geese and nazca matches the great pyramids ratio the distance between NASA and Giza is the same as between 30 wackyland Giza same thing between Angkor Wat Nazca and between mohenjo-daro and Easter Island for sites on the circle the distance between Easter Island and Giza is ten thousand times to call the number the anchor keys at distance multiplied by the golden number evens the keys and nazca distance and the keys alaska distance multiplied by the golden number equals the nazca anchor distance [Music] obviously this circle doesn't cover all the sites on earth but for my informant those on it our projection of stellar objects over the earth in my research on what had been said about the Great Pyramid I had left some elements aside that were certainly making sense actually we could have found all that much earlier in the 20th century the priest Moreau an astronomer pointed out that the Meridian passing through the Great Pyramid was dividing the emerged lands in two equal surfaces turning Giza into the central point of the planet 20 centuries before him Agata kites up gliders mentioned that the Great Pyramid was a geographic reflection of the earth this got confirmed by my informant who showed me that it was a maquette of the northern hemisphere something that could be verified with calculations but this dimension is also the average distance run by point in one second on the equator sudoku this is a given in physics indicating the speed of rotation of our planet on its axis I was aghast at the amount of things enclosed in the dimensions of such a mere item but everything my informant said was valid I could already hear the creep in kitchen stool arguments or even worse the toothbrush one on the bottom you can take any kind of object from a toothbrush to a steam locomotive and you roughly get all the figures proper to satisfy any vision that we might have to find figures skeptics were invoking chance believers God's hands I was only seeing a striking collection of facts as the writer how does actually put it facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored all of these were that odds with everything we believed to be our past I had to refocus the problem and the upper chamber helped me out each block of this chamber had been carried over 500 miles and its weight was worth 40 sedans feet to the tenth of a millimeter those blocks are perfectly horizontal and vertical when one centimeter off what I've got unnoticed and the builders didn't have the proper tools to check the precision why such a precision to answer that question two ways of thinking the first was the classic one delusion you all the brilliance the efforts the intelligence of the Egyptian craftsmen were aiming at a geometric four section but respecting the architects project because this monument was meant to connect with the realm of the gods from the first pyramid to the last statue yes there's a desire for cosmic balance and being a part of this cosmic balance was the duty and the wish of every Egyptian for them and for Egyptology overall since Egyptians ignore mathematics it was not worth studying them in the Great Pyramid this plain looking chamber was a masterpiece of design and realization the other way to think was probably more daring but to its credit more practical why fetching huge granite slabs located 500 miles away from Giza for the same reason as today granite doesn't change over time and it's dimensions stay the same from dimensions we get numbers and from numbers mathematics and according to my informants mathematics were the great pyramids language through time he drew two circles the first within the pyramid the other outside any process to subtract those two lengths in meters and told me and it will take this figure to a physicist so it'll probably like the value of the speed of light about the value of the speed of light in millions of meters per second and below the number from the pyramids ship adieu I don't have anything else to say you probably think that the pyramid drove me crazy and that I'm putting silly stuff in scientists mouth but when will piece things together you'll get that it was not that absurd actually those who dug this issue and dared talk about it are much more embarrassed that example for example if we look at the Great Pyramid without the prejudice with a fresh eye and when you're a physicist you measure and you notice many things like that coincidences but so many coincidences was such a big object see it's very disturbing we could keep thinking that all we saw was just a matter of chance that the Great Pyramid was indeed caps tomb even if such construction was hardly possible in such little time that if the Great Pyramid was signaling their Queen axis it was a matter of chance if the Great Pyramid was featuring the pie number and the golden number it was a matter of chance that the qubit was picked by chance that we could have accidentally bailed the only possible pyramid to bridge altogether the cubed pie the golden number and a mirror and if those values were expressed in mirrors in the Great Pyramid it was by chance that if the most ancient constructions we visited we're the most massive with the best-fitting it was by chance that if other people on earth were using urug lifts mummifying they're they're designing precise calendars had great astronomical skills and we're building with the same entice ice mix techniques without leaving any explanation it was by chance that if so many sacred sites were on a circle as long as our equator it was by chance that if some distance ratios were linked to the golden number it was by chance that if this dimension even our planet speed of rotation it was by chance that if the speed of light was indicated in the pyramid it was still and always by chance two hypotheses were then possible hypothesis aid we should rethink the sense of the world of chance because if it was working so many miracles we'd better call him God I prefer this be we could think that too many coincidences were hurt in coincidences that our history had missing links maybe as staggering as my informants discoveries and it was time to craft a rational explanation for the mysteries of our past who could ever she'd all this in the past as we know it Egyptians if you think they were not aware of the possibility of measuring the earth they would first have had to know that it was a sphere which was not at all in their imaginations and why not a much more ancient civilization that would have completely disappeared I find the alien option much more appealing because we can at least say yeah that there is a miss pharaonic Egypt in the pyramid an incentive for the imagination beyond sarcasm was there anything that could oppose the premise of an advanced civilization in the past si uncle si Deo exactly don't pussy given the possible accidents that could occur on earth like continental drift Wow volcanoes or major meteorite impacts nothing keeps us from saying that more advanced civilizations might have lived on our planet reveals or not what they're so if this premise couldn't be denied and looked most likely and if the explanations of Egyptology and archaeology were two scans and why turning it down the answer is simple it hurts belief even in those who pretend to have none the thing is that as incredible as the seem those facts can be verified and one can deny them without evidence see if for some reason our civilizations would disappear many things with withstand centuries but not millennia circle could take home with you my only a few big monuments worthy like I'd say the big pyramids in Egypt  let's go back to the main elements the builders had measured the earth they designed a scale model after it in the shape of a pyramid in which scientific parameters were featured they had lined up those location sites on a strip as long as the equator the builders seemed to be familiar with the speed of light after years of investigation I was convinced that all these had a specific purpose and since I felt that my informant knew better I started to question him restlessly I happen to be right it took me a while before deciding to share what's next but I had gone too far to bury the 37 year long research accomplished by my informant to understand the builders approach we need to take some distance and go back to March 2nd 1972 in the US when the second space probe pioneer 10 was launched they brought on board a small plate on which was carved out this funny drawing  but there was much more it conveys that we're a sexual species determines our size from the capsules the IRS's position in the solar system and it's geometric shapes when analyzed and interpreted reveal much more intricate stuff geometric patterns revealing information when analyzed thousands of years before the space probe pioneer ten builders of the Great Pyramid seem to have done the same except that it wasn't addressed to some civilization in the universe but to a future civilization on earth ours [Music] now we're going to leave the field of statements and facts for the dirty ground of assumptions and premises  let's assume it was a language and therefore a message [Music] to design and realize it with such dimensions taking the needed care to keep it readable thousands of years later meant that the message was of utmost significance [Music] according to my informant the builders had precisely signaled the equinoxes to draw our attention to a critical astronomical cycle of our planet  [Music] if you pick a star in the sky it will be one degree of 72 years later it will take 26,000 years for this star to accomplish a complete orbit  at 26,000 years pan represents a precession of the equinoxes cycle  to precisely locate the earth in the universe modern astronomers use the zodiac constellations which are simple main to observe the positions of the stars the constellations targeted by the Sphinx's eyes have shifted over time  [Music] the pyramidion found at the foot of the snafu Red Pyramid was providing another significant information its perimeter was precisely 12 cubits long and the presence of Pi referred to a circle a 12 stone circle a zodiac the pyramids for angles refer to for zodiacal signs Taurus Leo Scorpio and Aquarius in the antique world Scorpio was represented by an eagle and Aquarius by an angel as it occurs on the front of our cathedrals [Music]  four stars are assigned to those four signs among the shiniest ones they used to be called the four guardians of heaven they are Aldebaran in the Taurus constellation Regulus in Leo and Terry's in Scorpio and formal heart on top of pieces today but formally in Aquarius before modern astronomers proceeded to some modifications those stars seem to keep the same position between themselves and are used as steady reference points through time that axis is the torah' Scorpio axis formerly known as the Taurus Eagle axis that Babylonians depicted by a winged ball and this one is the Li Aquarius axis or Leo Angel according to the ancient calling his representation happens to be right here on the Giza Plateau it is the spanx a man's head on a lion's body  according to the prevailing theory although many geologists disagree the Sphinx was built after the Great Pyramid and those two monuments wouldn't be correlated an assertion challenged this time by decides geometry here are a few examples this triangle proportion to the Great Pyramid but five times bigger links hit summit to the smalls on one side and on the other goes through the Sphinx head if we outlined a squared base of the Great Pyramid and make it slide against it then the axis running through the right side hits again the Sphinx head at the same spot if we trace a circle whose Center is the junction between this axis and this one running through the two pyramid summits then we still hit the sphinx head at the same spot for my informants Pisa was an astronomical clock whose tile was those for steady reference points those four stars this clocks needle the Sphinx gaze turns around itself in a bit less than 26,000 years and enables to point precisely the Earth's position in this big cycle I pointed out that without a starting point we couldn't know where this cycle was at he then showed me a bump on the Sphinx's chest that Arabs called alcalde has had the lion's heart that so far nobody managed to explain coincidentally alcohol bar Assad was also the name Arabs gave to the brightest star in the Leo constellation Regulus since antiquity the Sphinx is a synonym for enigma and addresses mankind as the famous riddle goes who starts on four legs keep going on - and his sheaves on three remember the answer man and his destiny I will hold the Arabic name for Sphinx means father of terror probably to remind people of its function he added when the Sphinx's eyes will precisely gaze at Regulus or when the Sphinx's axis will be lined up with the lee aquarius's axes then a new precession of the equinoxes cycle will start anew according to him here was the Giza sites meaning a huge clock our planets clock which achieves a complete orbit in 26,000 years whatever we may think or say facts are here this clock works perfectly suddenly things became clear the pyramid indicating the equinoxes its direction precision the hokies assad's geometry which would reveal many other surprises yes but why drawing our attention on this 26,000 year big cycle I went to see a specialist in past climate studies so consetta curse acicular we know that these glacier and heat cycles are in sync with the Earth's orbital parameters orbital Leitao among what was called the Earth's orbital parameters was the precession of the equinoxes which affects our climate but we didn't know if it was gradually or brutally I went to check ancient writings in myths legends beliefs of many cultures the same idea of cycles in cyclic evens was brought up the water Cataclysm theme was widespread but also an upcoming fire destruction as in st. John's tale or in sacred Hindu texts called Puranas many Greek authors also mentioned cyclically Cataclysm one of them even forecasts when they would occur every 10 to 12 thousand years what seemed to fit Plato's account of Atlantis destruction but his story was brushed away by modern science another Greek scientist Aristotle seen as more reliable was also mentioning big revolutions occurring on earth and in the sky triggering the cyclic or disappearance of what was on the globe the Maya linked our time to the fifth Sun era following a water sign era dubious a new NASA rain and floods destroyed this humanity and this creation would be nothing very similar to the Bible's flood fit Sun is precisely a Sun of movement some of the earth in the air the fire the water movement it's not it's a Sun which will end the own fan this and will happen in a terrible quakes when the gods this idiot and this creation doesn't concern men's behavior it's simply the vital cycle decided by the gods that needs to be accomplished we don't give any credit to those legends but with scientific progress we gradually discovered that they might be based on facts there are other cases like tsunami that's a water release phenomenon through fragmentations of natural dams which flood the earth with very significant water masses it's very likely that many people were present at these phenomenons then they romanced it and then they worded it under the umbrella term the deluge no no delusion then I checked the last major climate change and I was surprised to discover that science data lead back from ten to twelve thousand years  climates in entire zones were thoroughly modified in the 19th century the mammoths found frozen and in good shape some even in the process of digesting got a lot of tension and is still puzzling our scientists there were not only mammoth other species had completely disappeared and we still don the why we can say that there are many species that probably disappeared but since they were not kept frozen we don't puzzle over their depth we can't answer because the research the studies aren't numerous enough and it's a matter of means of study of staff in that case which isn't considered a priority we'll answer that question when we get the human and financial means to answer it tens of species had completely disappeared entire forests turn into deserts ancient texts were mentioning cataclysms and therefore brutal evens but unfortunately without funding no answer who to turn to if the Giza Clock referred to the precession of equinoxes cycle what could be the relation to this circle if there was any my informant drew my attention on the North Pole which would belong to this circle if it was an equator and by chance this point was precisely located at the oscillation centre of the Earth's magnetic pole different from our north pole the pole magnetic nepa the magnetic pole isn't a steady point on the surface of our planet because moves at about 25 miles a year so today thanks to modern technologies we know that this oscillation phenomena increases which is very disturbing was this 25,000 mile circle and it's 40 degree incline a way to signal us the link between the equinoxes and this magnetic pole I also learned that this magnetic pole reversed itself many times uncom we've recorded about 100 pole inversions we didn't know why this inversion was occurring but some scientists thought that it could be linked to the Sun which also sometimes reverses its magnetic poles [Music] in versions already happened but we didn't know much on the batter sorry considering the direct consequences of the magnetic pole I think that today we need tens and hundreds of researches to gather round and brainstorms around this kind of research or session we see we try to understand the direct and indirect consequences of this inversions we observed important changes of our climate we had noticed an acceleration in the move of our magnetic pole but we were not ready to face anything one of the possible consequences of this magnetic poles inversion could be a magnetic field eclipse for a few hours or a few weeks and maybe also readjustments of the Earth's crust [Music] with our atmosphere the magnetic field screens the radiations coming from space if it disappeared our planet would get burned according to its exposition destruction by fire as in ancient texts in a weird and frightening way ancient warnings and modern sciences premises were matching up  if this phenomenon was known and understood by ancient builders and tick prophecies were shedding a new light there were no prophecies but forecasts based on real knowledge at the beginning of our civilization knowledge was priests business were they the quartz of some ancient knowledge in a recovering world with the mission of transmitting a salutary message 30 years what if through these enigmatic instructions builders wanted to warn us against the cyclic or unpredictable events that could eradicate their own civilization so bad that thousands of years later we wouldn't even remember them what happened to them  now you may understand my citations to share those conclusions because this quest to the source of our civilization took me where I would have preferred not to go  it was paradoxical to learn that a Janeiro civilization lived on our planet so generous that it warmed the necks of a potential threat and at the same time to realize that our time was running out it was raising so many questions that I felt dizzy  [Music]  researchers finally get those phones to light away  having met some of the most reluctant opponents to that kind of faces who wouldn't even consider them I bear no qualms about the fate of this movie this work will probably be misshaped attacked on its details and drawn out of context to be trivialized even worse so my kid are the persons without answering their questions  but only facts matter and my informant is inviting everyone to further this huge work of understanding because according to him the current climate change is queueing the apparel announced by the builders  although these conclusions are frightening one can't deny them and without evidence but in doubt and given what's at stake we'd better give our whole attention to it if the builders took the time to warn us it was probably because the loophole was available otherwise it would have been useless to do it  [Music] [Laughter] [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  you", "aVWJMcOptR8": "many people struggle with food and other consumer goods because they're simply using them wrong just because everyone else always eats a food or uses a consumer good a certain way doesn't mean it's the

an easy way to solve this problem here's how you can debone the wing with ease hold your chicken wing like a game controller and twist the ends back and forth until you feel the cartilage break then pull the second bone out the end this leaves one bone in the wing you then put the chicken wing in your mouth and pull it off the other bone leaving you with only chicken to chew this is the best way because you get to eat all the meat at once without the risk of encountering a bone when you chew number eight hard-boiled eggs for many people the hardest part of cooking hard-boiled eggs is peeling the shell off if you're struggling with this or avoiding making hard-boiled eggs altogether so you don't have to deal with it chances are you're doing it wrong the best solution is to add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water before you begin which raises the pH of the water boil the eggs for about 12 with two inches of water above the eggs when you're done cooking and I've cooked the eggs crack both ends on the counter and peel off some of the shell so you have a hole at the top and bottom of the egg now comes the fun part all you have to do is blow on one end of the egg and the shell should come right off they may be hard-boiled but they don't have to be hard peeled number seven oranges oranges are a good source of vitamin C and folate but they can be a hassle to peel here's an easy way

toothbrush but this is actually too much toothpaste a pea-sized amount is plenty another common mistake people make with toothpaste is rinsing their mouth immediately after brushing this isn't

help you with cleaning something other than your pearly whites you can use it to clean your car's headlights or to get persistent strong smells like garlic or onions off your hands number five ink and toner if you print things even occasionally you probably groan every time you get one of those to replace ink messages on your computer screen however replacing the cartridge right away isn't the most cost effective solution frequently these messages pop up when your ink has just reached a certain low level but there is still some left with ink cartridges simply take out the cartridge and use an unbent paper clip to pop the reset button on the cartridge then continue printing until you're printing gets light or totally non-existent then will you have to replace the cartridge with the larger toner cartridges take them out and shake them up then put them back in often you can get dozens more pages out of a cartridge by doing this number four leftover pizza mm-hmm leftover pizza is good in so many ways some people like eating it cold while others prefer to reheat it but if you're using a microwave or even a traditional oven you may not be getting the best tastiest flavor and texture from yesterday's pizza so what's the best way to reheat it fold your pizza slices up and put them in a waffle iron this keeps the crust crispy and even remounts the cheese plus you get a cool little grid shape on your pizza you can even fill the little squares with that extra sauce or Parmesan cheese you get from the pizza place number three apples an apple a day is supposed to keep the doctor away or so the saying goes I don't know about that but a whole apple a day will leave more room in your trash or recycling bin that's why you gotta eat it all that's right you can eat the whole Apple including the core the whole idea of the core being inedible is just a myth sure apple seeds do release cyanide when digested but unless you finally chew and eat about 200 apple seeds or about 20 apple cores you won't receive a fatal dose oh and you shouldn't peel apples either as the skin contains vitamins the best way to consume your Apple is to rinse it thoroughly start from the bottom and eat the whole thing skin stem and all number two liquid soap if you have to keep buying liquid soap frequently you may feel like you're washing a lot of money down the drain fortunately there's an easy way to save money and still get your hands clean wrap a rubber band around the neck of the pump this lets it go down partway but not all the way so you get a smaller amount of soap with each pump don't worry your hands will get just as clean and you won't have to buy soap as often you can stretch your soap even further by adding water when the pump bottle starts to run low you'll be able to stretch the bubbles a lot farther before you have to buy another refill number one pistachios pistachios are healthy nuts and they have pretty fun commercials too but sometimes getting them open is no fun especially when you're left with the neglected ones that you can't get the shell off thankfully there's an easy solution for this that might save you from going nuts just take another pistachio shell and insert it into the crack you should be able to fit it into most small slits with a bit of pressure and this will allow you to easily push apart the two sides of the shell this works because

pretty good day too didn't they? And South Carolina didn't lose as bad as they were supposed to so it was a pretty good day all the way around. Let's pray. Lord, we thank you. Father as a group we now do what your word says we come boldly before your throne with our petitions. Father you know I can do these talks by myself, but they sure are better when you do them. So we just ask you invade this time and you own this time and you redeem this time with your spirit. In Jesus name, Amen. How many of you grew up like I did: not rich? I grew up in Antioch, Tennessee a suburb of Nashville and it was not the poor end of town but it sure wasn't the rich end of town. Just workin folk, you know what I'm talking about. My dad thought work was a verb, he didn't think it was management theory. So when we went off to college while was going through four years of school we worked 40 to 60 hours a week some of y'all worked when you were in college. How many of y'all worked when you were in college? You know what I'm talking about. And none of you died from it, the ones that died aren't here so... These days they call that child abuse, you ask your kid to work in college you know. Little Jimmy, Little Jimmy needs to study. Little Jimmy's playing beer pong he needs a job. So that's how I grew up and so, Sharon and I, my wife and I we meet, we get married, we start off with nothing. How many of y'all started off with nothing? You remember we ain't got money honey but we got love. Good thing too because we ain't got any money. We were eating off a card table, driving in 1902 Pinto. For you young people that's a car, not a bean. And we got married, set up our first little apartment with two nickels to rub together, and we'd been married about a month and my wife remembers that she's a Baptist. She neglected to tell me this when we were dating. Never came up. But apparently there's a doctrinal thing once your a Baptist your always a Baptist or something I don't know what the deal is, but so she gets up on Sunday morning and says we're going to church and I said we aren't doing anything I'll be here drinking beer and watching football and um course she cried and I'm like I don't understand we never talked about this before and all the sudden you just, you know, you're a super Baptist. What's the deal? But um, so she takes off to church and and then every Sunday she crying go to church and these little heathen or she'd go to these little Baptist churches and they would pray for her heathen husband and um, so then I got into this multi-level thing that I was in for about 10 years one 3 month period. and uh, you know one of those deals where you make your friends are mad you know that deal. and so um anyway so I was gonna get rich me and one of my beer drinking buddies, there's a lot of beer in the story, but um and so we me and this little redneck guy that I was friends with me, two little rednecks trying to figure out how to be how to get rich in this business and so you know we were out there trying to do sales calls and we couldn't get anything to work and we had five questions and we just knew if we can get these five questions answered we could you know be one of those rich people in an MLM and we'd be having a yacht and all this kind of stuff and you know how they do that stuff and so we went to one of their pep rally things you know the big thing in the convention center and they have all the guys that are successful gals are successful get up on the stage and tell you how much money they're making and I'm making $800,000 a minute or whatever you know that stuff right. And they've all got big checks. I never got a big check like that, I wonder if you can get that at the bank or not but you know they've all got this stuff and so we finally at the end of the day the last guy to come up I kid you not his name was Rich. You can't make this up okay and so he was the guy we wanted to see cause he was the big dog right and then when he got up there he was even cooler than we thought and so he owned us you know I mean like credibility city and on top of that his talk it was like he had our five questions as his outline he went right down them man we're like this guy he knows everything this is the smartest guy on the planet and then he goes he gets tto he end of his talking he goes and there's one more thing, and we went no there's not we got them it's five you know and he goes no there's one more thing if you don't know God, you're going to struggle in business. And my buddy and I went \"Say what?!\" And he said when you put on the character of Christ it changes your character, it causes you to want to serve rather than to take, and you're more worthy of trust you're more trustworthy and servants have a tendency to win in business more than and so if you don't know God you're going to struggle in business he does this whole talk about God. And my buddy and I are going I never heard anything like that before in my life. So you know we go back, two little redneck guys, we go back to the like the Hampton Inn or whatever wherever we were staying and we get out the Gideon's Bible and it's Old King James. So it's like Shakespeare and Jesus, right? These and thous and thou and this and I'm like there's no possible way these two guys are gonna figure this out, right. So we sit there and look at it for a few minutes and like I have no idea. We closed it. But I did go home I told my wife I said we're going to church and she said who are you and what have you done with my husband? And so we visited a couple churches and one guys asleep in one of them and I'm like well if there's a Jesus you shouldn't be asleep about it so um you ought to be like excited. I like going to churches like this where we're having fun y'all know what I'm talking about? I mean sometimes you're going these places and they look like they're weaned on a pickle you know I mean its life is bad you know and so anyway this place they you know want people raising their hands like they knew the answer to a question or something and you know and one woman's up there swaying and I'm like I told Sharon we were sitting on the back and tell us if they get out snakes were leaving. And uh, so pretty soon you know we're walking through the backdoor the place and meet the pastor and his wife was one of those sweet sweet ladies and she just give everybody a hug that was there and you know week after week month after month we kept going and that woman literally hugged us into the kingdom. And we met Jesus there and it changed the trajectory of my life. It changed everything and I started we of course left that whole multi-level thing I told you just for three months and so we started buying and selling real estate um I grew up in the real estate business momma and daddy were in the real estate business So I knew the real estate business and I'm start doing flip this house before there's cable TV to tell you how right and so you know we're buying and selling houses and we got rich. By the time I was 26 years old I had four million dollars worth of real estate little over a million dollar net worth and twenty-five was my best year in that business i made $250,000 cash taxable income that year, that's twenty thousand dollars a month. I don't know what neighborhood you grew up in the neighborhood I grew up and we call that rich. And it was fun too. I had that car I always wanted, you got that car you always wanted some day when I make it I'll get that car you know that one for me it was a Jaguar I needed a Jaguar because nobody in the neighborhood I grew up in could spell Jaguar right, and so I got me a Jaguar man you know I'm riding along and within 90 days baby I was a Jaguar right you know right right oh man I was having fun and Sharon and I we went to Hawaii and we liked it so we went back. She likes little sparkly things we got her some. They weren't big enough so we got her some more. It was fun. Sometimes I hear these people say \"All those rich people are miserable.\" Uh-huh. Now I'm not theologically or philosophically shallow enough to tell you money will make you happy. Money will not make you happy. You get more money it will, it will make you more of what you are right now. If you are miserable and you get money, you will be lots of miserable. If you're a jerk and you get money, big jerk. And and it will mess with your family too to the extent there's crazy in your family, and we all got crazy in our family right? You know, if you don't think you got crazy in your family, it's you. Okay. So everybody's got something, right? And you put a little money on the crazy woohooo crazy gets crazy! Y'all know what I'm talking about? Is this real? So your money is not gonna solve your problems it's going to make them bigger. It's also gonna make your opportunities bigger if you're a generous person your generosity will go into overdrive. You'll be outrageously generous. To the and you get a lot of money we'll call you a philanthropist. Cool word that means you give a lot of it away and you have a blast doing it. You found the most fun you'll ever have with money is when you find that. So you know it was it was fun you guys but I did stupid stuff. How many of y'all ever done somethin stupid? How many of you didn't raise your hand and have a problem with lying? What do you think this is a rhetorical question? I mean seriously? I borrowed too much money, and our bank got sold to another bank out-of-state. I know that never happens around here. And a guy looked down sitting in another state and said there's a 26 year old kid in Nashville owes us a million two hundred thousand and he's flipping houses, we need to limit this relationship. Which is banker talk for ruin his life. And they called our notes. We weren't late, but they were 90 day notes so they had the option of doing that. They just said we don\\'t want to play anymore and I went, \"What?!\" That started a crash that took took two and a half years to unfold and we lost everything we owned. We were sued, we were, we were sued so many times. And they were all right I mean I made $250,000 one year, the next year my taxable income was 6,000. I spent the whole year selling stuff trying to pay my bills and trying to honor those things that I signed and I couldn't do it. Cause stupid will catch you and tackle you and I had signed up for stupid on steroids. I've done I mean I got a PhD in D.U.M.B. y'all. I mean. We were sued so much that the little guy with the Sheriff's Department that brings those little pink lawsuit papers we're like on a first-name basis with the old boy. Sharon's making him cookies, you know come on Harold. I mean, it's not his fault bless his heart, what a job you know oh man and-and-and. We had a brand-new baby and a toddler, and our marriage is hanging on by a thread. Y'all I was so scared I didn't know what to do. I remember standing in the shower with it so hot in my face I could just barely stand there and I would just stand there and cry. I was so scared. 28 years old I got babies, my poor wife. She thought she married Sir Galahad turns out it was Goober. I mean I had missed it up y'all, I drove  NASCAR into the wall engines up in the stands I mean it's it was a blow-up. I mean we didn't get a divorce I mean number one cause of divorce in North America today money fights and money problems y'all know you have a good money fight but if your a hillbilly and you have a good money fight it's real fight. I mean we didn't get a divorce shall we held on to each other but sometimes it's to get a better grip you know what I'm saying and I mean she's from the hills of East Tennessee frying pan throwing there is an Olympic event. You know it's like man and finally we hit bottom and we were bankrupt. I was doing one of these new shows the other day I do these Fox and Friends and Good Morning America stuff and one of those news anchors is like \"You know this is a cool story you start with nothing you become a millionaire you lost everything know your multi-millionaire how did you bounce back?\" I went dude when you fall that far you really don\\'t bounce. It was more of a splat. I said I'd like to tell you bounce back but I didn't I set around whined and blamed everybody else. You ever do something stupid and blame everybody somebody else? Yeah. Turns out McDonalds does serve hot coffee, you know. It's like, man. We live in a, we live in a culture of victims don't we it's unbelievable and so victims of our own stupidity all of us it's unbelievable. And so man I sat around whined. But, I tell you this: you know I met God as I told you on the way up but I got to know him on the way down. And you I mean we were ground into powder there was nothing left. We had a I surrender all moment and it wasn't about this Baptist altar call baby I mean we surrendered. White flag. You're in charge. What do you want us to do? Because I didn't know how to be a husband. I didn't know how to be a dad. I didn't know how to handle money, obviously. I had a degree in finance, but I got to thinking about it who was it taught me to borrow money this was my finance professor in college who was broke. Know what's wrong with that picture? It's like a shop teacher with missing fingers. So you know I mean so we get this thing out and it turns out my Heavenly Father even in spite of my stupidity is crazy about me. Even in spite of my black heart he's crazy about me. Even in spite of my darkness and the worst Dave that there is he knows him, he still loves him. He's crazy about me. And he's got a plan and it's not to bring me harm. But to bring me hope. And so I dove in here hard. And I'm like okay how do you be married? Submit yourselves one to another. Oh no I gotta dry dishes. Now don\\'t spare the rod, my kid\\'s like \"What\\'s that Dad?\" Come here baby I\\'ll show you. 2,500 scriptures on how to handle money and possessions. And I started reading people like Ron Blue and Larry Burkett and Howard Dayton who were the first guys in the Christian space in the modern era to talk about what the Bible says about money and I was amazed and I started living Sharon and I started living by those principles and they started working. Now I won't tell you it was instant, it was not instant. If you're looking for instant if you want get-rich-quick, God is not in the microwave business he's a crockpot guy. It's gonna take t-i-m-e time, time. But man when you start living your life this way this is a compass it shows you which ways North and you're not lost anymore. I don't always like what it says but it's usually because i'm wrong, hello. I don't know if I agree with what, with God? [laughing] Yeah right. I had a spiritual moment when I realized God was smarter than me you know. Ok i'm probably going to do it this way because it's working. All these years later it does work and not only did Sharon and I get back on our feet gradually and slowly and start building wealth again, because you know we live in a cause-and-effect world what you plant you will harvest you will reap what you sow, right? So if you plant stupid you will get a crop of desperate. I've done it and you know if you plant corn don't be looking for beans to come up. Don't be shocked by, cause what you put into your life is what you're going to get out. God is real clear, it's all through Scripture, it's a cause-effect the whole thing you know the cause effect the theorem of cause and effect was you know a Christian physicist that discovered the Christian worldview and so you start to understand that that's how the universe works and our lives are the same way and yet we live them randomly. And we go I wonder how that happened? Well you know you planted it six months ago and it grew up and smacked you in the back of the head and that's what happens in our lives isn't it? This is real. So, we start teaching a little Sunday School class had about 30 people in there. And then we looked up there's about 500 in there. And we took a little book and printed it and nobody would buy it and I was selling it out of the trunk of my car in a video store, bookstores wouldn't carry it. And finally some bookstores started carrying it, and then publishers wanted to publish it, and then all these you know 12 million books later here we are, you know. We start teaching a little class called Financial Peace University and with a bad suit and an overhead projector and now all these years later four-and-a-half million families have gone through it and forty thousand churches. I mean God really knows how to take lemons and make lemonade, doesn't He? He knows how to take something and turn it around. So if your life's in a mess I'm here to tell you I got mess down. I know what mess looks like and we serve a God who cleans up messes and seals broken hearts and touches wounds and and turns things around. And if you're too cool for school you're smart oh He'll get to you. He'll help you He'll help you course-correct and knock the hair off your head I'll tell you that but He'll course-correct you. Because He loves you He's crazy about you. So we found that there's five things that if you do these five things with money over a period of time like 10 or 15 years you will build a level of wealth one hundred percent of the time. And now I said a level of wealth I don't know what level because I can't predict car wrecks and cancer, I can't predict tragedy and I don't know what your income will be. But if you're working and you do these five things, you will build a level of wealth one hundred percent of the time. And this is not some prosperity thing and it's not mystical magical when I cover these five things, they're all common sense. But common sense is so rare now it's like having a superpower. So when you plug God's common sense and it changes everything. So let's look at the five the first one is get on a budget. A written plan. Jesus said for which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost lest to get halfway up and is unable to finish and all who see him begin to mock him and say this man began to build and was unable to finish. Another Christian they can't pay their bills. I added that last part. You have to do a budget. On paper. On purpose. Before the month begins, every month. If you work for a company called you incorporated and you manage money for you incorporated the way you manage money for you now would you fire you, don't answer that. And you know we misbehave with money the Bible says he who is impulsive exalts folly, folly is the verb of a fool in action he who is impulsive is a fool in action. Been there done that. Arrow right here. And fools you don't want to be a biblical fool. This is not a greeting like \"Hey fool\" no this is like an idiot. You don't want to be that kind of fool. And so we're disorganized, we don't have a plan, nothing's written down, and we have the unmitigated gall to pray to our Heavenly Father the maker of Heaven and Earth and say Lord I'm misbehaving, I'm horrible, and I'm incompetent, but send me more money. To which he looks at us and says, \"No.\" It\\'s in the Bible. Parable of the talents. Master gives three servants an amount of money to manage. Comes back later, two of them managed it well, one of them didn't. The one that didn't he not only didn't give him more, he took the money away from him who managed poorly and gave it to the one that had the most. Who had managed at the best. And then there's that wealth inequality scripture. Hahaha. That says right after that those who are faithful in the little things will be given more to manage. And so my son who's 15 years old many years ago decides he wants a brand-new Corvette when he turns 16. To which I looked at him and I said I'm a loving Heavenly Father, except I'm not heavenly, I'm a loving father. No, you cannot have a new Corvette. Although that sounds like a blessing to you my son It's 465 horsepower, it has a fiberglass body, it will go from zero to 60 in 3.1 seconds, you are incompetent as a driver I've seen you drive you will kill yourself. And until you prove your competence we're not even going to talk about something that ridiculous. So right now what you will get is an old Chevette with a tired gerbil under the hood. Because I remember when I was 16 my first car by the time I got rid of it it had been hit on all eight sides. Be faithful in the little things, decide. The interesting thing about each one of these principles is, you can just decide today to do them. Had a guy working for me and he was not doing his process right and I sat down and I said this is what you need to do and he goes well I it's not the way I do it and I said change. And he said well I'm not like you and I said change. You can decide today to be good at this, or leave. Change. Change. You can decide when you go home, you can decide to do a budget today. Get out a yellow pad or go free budget online every dollar com you can decide today. I'm gonna start managing money well today. Today. You can decide. Because you're going to keep getting what you've been getting if you keep doing what you've been doing, you know this right? Sowing and reaping. And the second one is you need to get out of debt. Now we know this one. You knew Dave Ramsey was going to talk about getting out of debt. Because you know the Bible says the borrower is slave to the lender. It's real. Now the Bible does not say that debt is a Salvation issue. You can have a MasterCard and go to heaven. The Bible does not say debt is a sin. I can't find that in there. But I have studied this for 30-plus years and I cannot find a single scripture anywhere that God used debt to bless his people or a single scripture anywhere that says anything positive about debt. It always says you're a fool, it's a curse, you're a slave, and then we continue to engage in it and in our intellectual minds we somehow figured out how we are smarter than God. While all through the Bible it basically says debt is stupid. And those that engage in stupid things are, well, stupid. And I've been stupid I told you that so I'm not calling you names. Here's the deal the borrower is slave to the lender. You don't think this is so? Think about this: your most powerful wealth building tool is your income. Let me show you what slavery looks like. This week they came out with new data that shows that the average car payment in America today according to National Auto Dealers association is 499 dollars. That's dangerously close to 500. You take 500 bucks a month and invest it from age 30 to age 70 in a decent growth stock mutual fund, You'll have 5.6 million dollars. That's what a car payment costs you. So who'd you make rich? General Motors? Ford? Lexus? I don't know who was it? You made somebody rich. It wasn't you. And you driving along in something you can't afford scratching your head, wondering why your kids college fund isn't funded. Because we're giving it all to somebody else. And they have nicer furniture in their building, have you noticed? Something's going on here guys. You know and some people in here got a student loan's been around so long you think it's a pet. You got Master card in your life. I mean it's hard to be a slave if you don't have a Master so you might as well. We've discovered bondage. And American distress. And just keeps going and going and have done it to y'all, I'm not picking on anybody I'm just saying here's the deal think about this what if you had no payments? Can't even get my head around that. Well you're always gonna have a car payment, you ever hear people say that? Little man can't get ahead, you're always going to have a car payment so drive something nice, YOLO. Right? Which by the way is addressed in Proverbs. Says fool right after that. See this is how we talk when we're losing. You know we can't get ahead I sure hope we can elect a president who will fix my life. Not gonna happen. Neither one of them got the goods I'll just tell you. You're in charge of your life and you and Jesus I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me are the only shot you got it's the only one is gonna work and that's what changes. Don't be listening to these people little man can't get ahead you talk to these people you think their spirit animal is Eeyore. It's unbelievable. So how do you get out of debt? Well you have to decide to not borrow any more that's first step, isn't it? I have we had plastic surgery at our house, we had a plastectomy. Decided we're not borrowing money anymore. MasterCard Capital One. What's in your wallet? Money. You're weird Dave. You're right, and I'm not broke anymore either. I decided I'm not living like this. I haven't had a credit card in 30 years. You don't have a credit card?! I don't have a credit card. That's my wallet. Got green President's faces. And it's got four pieces of, [applause] thank you, it's got four pieces of plastic in here. Two debit cards, one on my business, one on my personal account, which will do everything your stupid credit card will do. I travel more than any two of you put together shut up it works ok. Dave you're not getting the airline miles yeah I've met a lot of millionaires and none of them said Dave I made it all on my airline miles, I haven't heard that one so. So I got four pieces of plastic in here these two debit cards my driver's license in my handgun carry permit. I said that in California about got arrested. It's good to be back in America. Um They just don't speak Southern over there it's not good for me. And the third thing once you're out of debt then, you need to be careful to foster high quality relationships. What's that got to do with money? Everything. There's a huge correlation for those that build wealth and who they hang around with. Because you become who you hang around with have you noticed that? You do! I mean I was in Boston thursday night doing an event you know those people all have an accent? You become who you hang around with you don't let your kids hang around with little juvenile delinquents right? If little Johnny down the streets a weed head you don't let your kid run with little Johnny because you know you're gonna have a weed head in your house right? You know we know this. So you know they come home with that mouth on them and you're going where'd you learn that? That'll get you knocked into next week in this house I mean what or do you think you could do you get away with that? I'll take you out and make another one looks just like you you know I mean you know. It's cause they're hanging out a little Johnny right you know what happens we're the same way y'all. We're the same way. You talk like the people you hang around with you, you read the books they talk about, you know if you don't read and all your friends watch The Bachelor well here's a clue okay here's what's going on if this is all you know about is reality TV that's not a reality probably we need to change our diet you know and you don't read a book and so Charlie tremendous Jones said five years from today you'll be the same person you are today except for the books you read the people you meet. I mean don't be deceived evil company corrupts good habits and you know this the studies have shown that over a 10-year period of time that your income will approximate will become within ten to twenty percent of the average of your 10 closest friends income. Because you have the same habits they've got the same diet into your self that they've got if you want to learn scripture hang out with people that know scripture and are memorizing scripture you want to have a filthy mouth hang out with people with a filthy mouth you'll have it you can't stop yourself from doing it you will become who you hang around with and all the studies show that we have a tendency now that's not to say I'm some kind of snob and I don't have any friends aren't rich friends not that at all I have lots of friends but my closest hangs are people I want to be like that's my closest ones now I'll talk to anybody but like when our daughters were you know our daughters are growing up they're grown and married two wonderful men now but you know they're in high school and they're wanting to go on a date we didn't do missionary dating you don't get the date little Johnny the weed head and lead him to Jesus that's not gonna work okay we're not doing this little johnny can go to camp and get saved again you know we'll work on this right and so no uh-huh you come up in our house pick up one of our daughters honk your horn you better be delivering pizza alright so coming in talking to the old man you know be cleaning my gun when you get home you know the song right and so I mean this is kind of thing i'm teaching dad all the boys and youth group are scared of you good good keeps away two things you don't want baby doll you don't want jerks and you don't want wusses and if I can keep both those away and then I teach you how to keep them away you can pick good. And guess what they both picked good they both picked good they're married studs man i got some son-in-law unbelievable love Jesus love their wife love their kids I mean fight for their family I got man my sons in law are awesome it was an accident started praying for my sons-in-law when my daughters were born and praying still praying for my son's wife because he hadn't found her but he'll get around to it and you know but the you see what I'm saying y'all and you become who you hang around with and you need to make these choices very very carefully the third thing or the fourth thing is you need to save and invest. In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil wise people save money that's what this means oil is a sign of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament it was used to anoint kings and it was used to keep the oil burning in the Holy of Holies and so it was used in the marketplace like we use green president's faces as a medium of exchange if you had a carafe of oil you were ready to do business it was a sign of wealth there were two classes of people poor people and rich people most of the people were poor people this is the Mediterranean we're talking they ate hummus and olives no meat a little bit of bread maybe maybe a fish if they got some meat but that was it rich people ate what we eat every day spices good meat Charleston food scene you know what I'm saying right cooking it up right you know what I'm saying that that's fine food stores of choice food and oil food choice food and oil are symbols of wealth so let's read that again in the house of the wise are stores of money wise people save money why well start with we say for an emergency right grandma said she said save for a what rainy day visual aid it's gonna rain it's gonna rain you're gonna have a car wreck you're gonna lose your job something's gonna happen you're gonna need some money Dave you need to be positive I'm positive it's gonna rain something's gonna come up this one I don't understand unexpected pregnancy say what? ok but people come up with all kinds of things that are emergencies right and something's gonna happen and then you need to save an invest so you retire with dignity you know I'm gonna spend everything i make and hope the government which is well known for its ability to handle money will take care of me dumb idea they can't find I mean that they don't i'm not even sure some of them have opposable thumbs up there you know I'm saying it's just ridiculous and we're counting on them and some whacked-out kind of way to come be that they're not coming there is no white horse there is no Calvary your it you and me and Jesus ok you are in charge of your destiny and that's great news it's great news and so I'm all worried about the election and I'm not worried about the election because I've made money under both parties turns out it wasn't up to them in either case I've lost money under both parties none of them sent me a check they all just want money they're extracting like a tick extracting blood all the time that's all they do this is the deal so in the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil by the way the rest of that one says and a foolish man devours all he has if you spend everything you make the Bible just called you a fool again I've been a fool call me a fool too and I decided to change the last one is this God loves a cheerful Giver he loves a cheerful Giver and this is all about generosity oh yes it's about the tithe the tithe to your local church you're an evangelical Christian yes tithe to your local church absolutely that's a baseline that's a starting point but this is all about cheerfulness it's about your generosity is not just a transfer of funds generosity is a spirit where you decide to be a generous person generous people are more attractive they smile they are not grouchy it's not all about them they're the ones that open the door they're the ones when the grocery bag has the bottom dropped and your groceries are rolling all over the parking lot they're the ones out there helping you pick it up these are the people that when they go out to eat after church they leave a tip you cheap Christians servers don't want even waht to work on sunday because of us ridiculous well us i'm not I leave big tips big tips because it's a form of generosity when they didn't give me good service oh shut up carrying a tray that weighs more than you. Figure it out. They parked your car in the rain and the heat shut up give him some money. They park your hundred thirty thousand dollar car and you give them three dollars what are you a nut that's Ferris Bueller parking the car there take care of that man I get my twenty-dollar bill my car still sitting there when I come out it's amazing besides that the guys working his way through college or something right then and he says better than I deserve that's his code for I'm getting out of debt if they say that you gotta give them a double tip so I gave him 40 my wife's like I'm gonna park your car and no you're not you're not you're not working your way out of college you've already put up with me for 30 years so it's alright generosity is a spirit it changes everything in your life and God loves when we are cheerful givers because we're made over in His image and he's a giver he gave His only begotten Son. He's a giver. We can't call ourselves in His image until we change our posture in our spirit about this but it's awful tough to give if you're broke if you're in debt and you haven't saved any money and you don't have a plan and you're not hanging out with other people who are givers and some change you get to decide today it'll change your life when scripture intersects your life the truth of God intersects your life it moves from your head and travels 18 inches into your heart it changes your behavior and changes the trajectory of your life it will change your family tree you will change everyone with your last name that follows you if you do these things it's that powerful because there's this great plus sign on the scope of history and it's the cross and it's an opportunity that his mercies are new every morning I get the opportunity to do it again you have the opportunity to thank you Jesus for your grace in spite of all the bad things that I've done and I am in spite of all of that I'm so much better than I was but I'm still not even close thank goodness poor Sharon's not married to the same guy she married all these years later he's a lot better husband he's a lot better daddy he's a lot better leader than he was when he was 32 years old open this company he's a lot better at money than he was he keeps getting better and learning and growing and learning and growing still not there still not there but I'm a lot better than I was and it's been a wild ride y'all it's the most it's the most fun journey you can if you don't know this that guy named jesus oh my goodness you're missing out on the roller coaster ride of your life it's so thrilling you will throw your hands up and go woohoo and you oh man it just it's a it's unbelievable that the sorrows are deeper and the joys are higher it changes everything it changes everything and when you move this money piece around it gives you the tools to be that in the marketplace and to be that for your family and to get this monkey off your back and get that elephant out of the room because he's got to go God we thank you for this day we thank you for these folks thank you for these pastors generations of pastoring this church and what just wonderful men and women are here thank you for letting me be a part of this family this weekend and God we just pray blessings and mercy and grace and healing on the families that are sitting here and and Father some people are sitting here that are still got their arms crossed and Father that's between you and them be gentle with them don't hit em any harder than you have to get their attention love em Lord love em well in Jesus name amen", "hVShA7g4Joc": "I'm very excited (Laughter) Well I'm excited not just to be at TEDx Sandego But touch on my favorite subject (The secret to motivating your children) What I mean is that we do our best to motivate them But what we do mostly is that we scare them \"If you don't do this, you'll get a big obstacle.\" Or we bribe them \"well, if you do this, you will get a prize or money\" This may work, but in the short term But there are long-term repercussions and consequences that we do not realize When we treat them this way So today I want to ask you a question How many of you love his relationship with his children better? Raise your hands Of course, all of you! Now a more difficult question How many of you believe that he knows exactly how to motivate his children? Don't worry and don't be upset, I don't see anyone's hands! Don't take this personally I spent more than twenty years teaching this Less than 2% of parents have the exact answer to this question The good news is At the end of this conversation, you will all know in one word exactly How do you motivate your children So let me start by telling you this real story I live in Mexico City and we were at a party It was a birthday party for a ten-year-old girl My girlfriend has four girls who just didn't behave badly But terribly (Laughter) I got to the point that my girlfriend was very tired so I went to the four girls \"You four come here, either you will behave well or we will leave\" And let me tell you that the best part of the party is Pinata. (The famous pinata) is a model full of good things There is no child who wants to leave before Pinata. So the first girl looked at her mother and said: \"My mom, you are right. I have been telling my sisters to act properly But they didn't give me any attention, what can I do? \" Mother: \u201cI'm doing well.\u201d The second girl looked at her mother And she started crying \"I'm so sorry, Mom.\" \"I hate to be disappointed.\" \"But watch if I don't do what my sisters say, they'll think I'm weak.\" \"And I always listen to you, they won't love me.\" \"But I also don't want you not to love me.\" (crying) (Laughter) Depression completely, I went to the corner of his depression Most likely you need treatment after that The third girl looked at her mother: \"My mother is the most beautiful and wonderful mother\" (Laughter) \"Keep enjoying what you're doing. I will definitely do well.\" \"I have a great time.\" I waited five minutes, guess what I did ?! She went back to completing what she was doing The last girl looked at her mother and said: \"Really? Okay, let's leave now.\" (Laughter) what happened? The same family, and education, they all grew up in one place, Why was their reaction different? All of you will probably say \"for sure, because they are different.\" As long as they are clearly different, we usually give the same instructions Different people expect the same result? This is what we will talk about today What I did was get the four girls from Mexico City. (Laughter) They will tell you a little bit about themselves And the most important part is what motivated each of them In several words or in one word Let me give you the first girl By the way, this is mine (Laughter) Let me give you the first girl Her name is (Donna) because she is in control \"Hello, I am a child who loves to control, yes that is, I know that and I don't care I like to get things done quickly, very quickly. \"I am very independent, I love things quickly and directly, I have a strong willpower.\" \"What I mean, is that since I was a child, if I had been on the car for four hours\" \"And I didn't like the car seat, I was crying.\" \"And stop crying until the four hours are over.\" I mean, I get what I want, I'm not asking for it, but I'm asking for it. I mean, this is how life should be, right? \"Let's get what we want, let's insist.\" \"I am very adventurous and strong\" What do you think motivates me? \"Well, challenges? I'd love to be right.\" \"I know they'll say the most important thing is to be happy.\" \"I don't know who said that.\" I mean, logically. Being right is more important than being happy. \"Winning and dominance are very important.\" \"But if you can remember one word, remember this: I need strength.\" I love to feel strong. So next time you are dealing with me. \"If you take my strength from me, you will come out the worst in me\" \"So if I was at his party and my mom told me: \"If I misbehave, I'll take you away.\" \"Really? We'll see, we'll see who will win.\" So the question here, what should the mother have been saying? Well, the answer is Before we get any answer, ask yourselves what motivates Donna? Power So why not tell (Donna) \"Hello (Donna) Can you please do me?\" \"Look, your sisters follow you, I hope they follow me more.\" \"I need your help\" \"I know I ask a lot, because you are only a ten-year-old child.\" \"What I am asking you to do, I must ask the adults.\" So I hope you help me with that. \"Can you help me to be a good model for your sisters?\" \"Can you do that?\" Do you think she will refuse that ?! That is very convenient We got the first result And now I want to introduce Sally to you. Before I introduce you to Sally, this is Daughter. So I became an expert on this topic (Laughter) Hi, I'm Sally, the social girl. \"I am a happy girl, I love fun, I love doing happy things \"And I like to communicate with people and talk to them and know them\" \"Is there anything in life other than knowing a lot of friends?\" \"And that we have a lot of them?\" \"For me, helping others and having a great time is really cool.\" At the party, you should ask yourselves what motivates us? Well, as social people, we need to communicate with people Let's make friends and help others Our secret is: communication and fun My mom should have told me: What if she said \"Hey, look at these trees, aren't they a great place to hide?\" \"Why not organize a great hide-and-seek game?\" \"Do you think I will refuse that?\" \"Do you think I will return to do what I was doing?\" \"When I can play the hide-and-seek game\" Look how smooth it is, and it gets natural When we get motivated to do what we were born for? This is our social girl Let me introduce you (in VI) to my social sister It gave me an experience to deal with social people If you hear laughter, this is my mom (Laughter) Third, I want to introduce Patty to you. \"good afternoon\" (Laughter) My name is (Patty). I love help and stability and my family. \"I love to be close to my family, I miss them when I am away from them.\" \"I don't like pressure, and I hate argument.\" \"I'm really nervous of that.\" \"I love that people coexist with each other, love each other, share and care for each other.\" \"What motivates me so much?\" Harmony, safety, kindness, acceptance and other help \"My secret is safety\" If I feel safe, I'll go to the end of the world \"But if I feel threatened, I make absolutely no effort.\" \"I could freeze.\" \"So, what was my mom supposed to say?\" She could come to me in a loving way and say: (Patty) I know you want to please your sisters, I understand And I know you are upset because you want to please me But remember, life is not just to please others Know that you are in the depths of your heart, you know what is right Trust your heart and not the people around you, but trust yourself No matter what happens, I am always by your side and love you (Deep breath) This is very good Remember, if you have children like me Always through patience, love and understanding Please don't have to press, don't do that This is my girlfriend (Valentina), my daughter (Patty) who taught me The personality style is nice and has a wonderful human heart Last but not least Hello, my name is Anna. I am a responsible child. \"since I was born\" I follow the rules, because for this purpose I have been established, and I hope everyone will follow I'm very tidy, organize things wonderfully Therefore, I am a good girl and my grades are good You can say we are perfect children The problem is that we need to highlight a few things Because we take a lot of responsibility, seriousness a lot Therefore, we always have stomach pain When we get older, if you know people like me, we will have gastroenteritis And a lot of stomach pain (Laughter) We are very aware So what motivates us is arrangement, construction and mental challenges Our secret is purity Step by step, specific instructions and we'll get our best From my daughters (Anna) her reaction was the best Because she said \"I know my mom\" We can give her instructions How to help her sisters to do wonderful things In conclusion, let me introduce my sister Finn My sister analyst, when I grew up It helped me understand the importance of hygiene Beside the ballast, right? (Laughter) To get to the conclusion, I hope that when you talk to your children, you will remember what motivates them Is it power? Communication and fun? Is it safe? Purity? I invite you to create a chain reaction For all parents to turn control into motivation thank you (clap)", "H02YcexnEqc": "", "Doyqp5Ue6XY": "okay so I just started the rinsing process and we have already found another piece of surface gold I never get sick of seeing this another piece of surface gold just staring at me right in the face  there is no Wi-Fi out here but I promise you you will find a better connection good morning or good afternoon everybody welcome to the channel if you are new to it my name is Pauly your host here today we are exploring my brand new claim now I notice there's a lot of bedrock on this claim so I think the best thing to do for our first day is to really just do some crevice thing now my first day I just main first day bringing you guys along I was here just the other day working on this crevice here but I could not remove this but now I actually have a tool that will actually move this big piece of bedrock so first thing we're gonna do is just finish this crevice that I got started the other day and then when we're done this and we're satisfied with it we're gonna move on and see what else we can find  okay so I got this little chunk out now for the rest all right just removed all the overburden bedrock in the center of this crevice now it's just a matter of scooping it all out see what kind of gold we get and that will determine whether we stick to this line or we move on so right as I turn off the camera I noticed our first piece of exposed candy that's a good sign that there's gold around now I obviously know that there's gold here I mean this is why I'm coming back to the spot but it's just best to clean out a spot when you start working it so here we are let's continue I just coming up that piece I saw or not  first little pan microdots that you probably can't see on to the next  all right second pan and we're looking much better we have one little chunky piece that you could probably see and a whole bunch of little micros however there are too little wiry looking pieces in there which I do like so let's stay on this trend and hopefully continue to find more candy we are slowly making progress I still have a little bit more to move right here and once that's done I'll get this all wet hopefully find more exposed cracks that I can actually break open and get to the real bottom of the bedrock and then hopefully we'll be able to use my little sucker tool over there and suck out everything yes yes look at all that breaking bedrock gold will hide in Breaking Bad Rock looking good so I just did another pan and of course I wasn't filming it but check this out Oh Oh what do we have here yes look at that we have a nice piece of gold I would consider that a picker and a bunch of little bits of gold and we're not even at the very bottom yet so next thing to do is obviously just finish cleaning out all this dirtiness and then now we're gonna fill it full of water suck it out and then we'll see what we get  so there is a lot more material than I thought there would be so what I'm going to do is pan this down till there's only a little bit of material left and then I'm going to go back get more dirt and then add to that pan and just so keep repeating that process until we have one pan left and then hopefully we will do one reveal of maybe a lot of gold who knows  next pan oh geez  ok so it's been about 15 minutes and as you can see there's still more material to pan out and I've done about five pans and I couldn't resist it I did a little peek and check that out two pieces of visible gold so we know we're doing the right thing now it's just a matter of continuing this process I think I have one maybe two more pans left then I'll soak it rinse it suck it out and then we'll do hopefully an even better reveal  okay so I just started the rinsing process and we've already found another piece of surface gold I never get sick of seeing this another piece of surface gold just staring at me right in the face again it you when you see this you just never get sick of it that is really cool okay let's pick it up with some tweezers because it's a lot more fun to do it this way my other camera set up okay oh nice hopefully my other camera is focusing on this hoop that is a nice little flat piece of gold and a stick with it sweet so before I forget I'm gonna put that piece of gold and the snuffle and I'm just going to quickly rinse a little more just to see if we're not missing anything else  I love doing that I don't see anything all right we'll get to scraping and then second now before I continue this crevice I just wanted to quickly take this opportunity to announce something some of you out there have been asking me if there's a way to further support pioneer Pauley and there wasn't for the longest time I just don't like to accept anything to be honest but now there is I set up a temporary line of Pioneer poly merchandise which includes the logo that I usually wear it but I didn't didn't wear it today and then some other random stuff that you may find funny so now you can further support the channel and plus you can get something out of it for you or even a friend okay because I'm impatient I'm just going to pan this out right now which is about seven or eight pans of concentrated material and then we'll use a sucker tool to finish it all  Plus dick  all right almost really  hey I can see ya okay can I turn you around okay okay okay let's see yeah it's hard to do this with one hand we do have gold showing up I'm so bad at this yay okay I got to do a better job one sec all right just getting rid of a little bit more material to make this one hand pan man guy do a better job oh my gosh there we go so all over the place but there you have it some candy that's not tea bag seven or eight pans cool now let's suck out the rest here's a better shot for you guys I thought I'd try a little bit harder we have a little piece of wire in there to show that sweet okay time to sucker out  so I cleaned out this crevice the best I could with my sucker tube now I can't really get the very very very very very bottom of this crevice because the sucker tube just doesn't allow it doesn't go deep enough so I used my it's not for bottle to kind of suck up the areas that I missed filled up the bucket a little bit better and now it's time to cross her fingers and see what we get  there's not a lot of material in there but hopefully will be a lot of gold  and your nuggets trapped in this crossfire no no one  all right we're getting close  a little closer no gold yet hope some tiny bits okay alright that is awesome okay I'm gonna grab the grab the camera so this is kind of awkward because I'm kind of hold a pan over my mic so doesn't get wet but there is clearly gold there that is really cool I love seeing these little bits that you can kind of pick up well I can pick that one up that's cool so I'm noticing all the fine gold is disappearing the deeper I go which is a good sign because that means you're going to the bigger gold I was trying to be educational but the deeper you go the more closer you are to the bedrock the better gold you will find so with that kind of color it's gonna be really hard just to leave this so for more reassurance I dumped out my snuffer bottle and yeah with that kind of color I'm not just gonna walk away from this I'm now obligated to dig as deep as I can because who knows you you could find a nugget just crammed in the very bottom I am noticing a little bit more cracks in here too so I'm just gonna stick to this and hopefully find more all right so here we go again I broke up more bedrock that's all the material that I was able to remove sucked up a bit more and yeah we're gonna go pan this but my buddy Jimbo over there just found his first picker so I just congratulated him on social media wonderful alright let's pan this out I'm gonna be very quick with this I hate that I'm gonna be very quick with this because it's starting to rain again and I just want to put my camera away  why bedrock lot of sharp bloodthirsty bedrock well there's a little bit of gold but a couple specs in there okay I'll do a better clean up for you guys okay so not as good as I thought it would be but that's where the flower gold was okay so we're calling it a day today we've been here for about eight hours now and it's starting to rain pretty hard so let's hurry up go home check out the gold and do a little dance  so that wasn't a bad day at all I was honestly hoping to find a big nugget in there but you can't get them every time but maybe coming up when we scuba dive that waterfall from my last video we will find the mother lode anyways this is a loot that we found today yes no complaints here I left the city got in touch with nature and returned with some jewelry now here's a photo of Jimbo's take for the day he is quite happy and I'm happy he left me with an unfinished crevasse to work next time so let's just weigh the gold and talk about how much time I wasted I'd like to start off by weighing that one biggest piece that I have in there point one eight grams all right that's not too bad now for the rest of this stuff  come on five ounces point 72 grams so less than 50 bucks anyways that is it for this video if you enjoyed it please let me know by leaving a like just like comment or

better perceive our universe and understand the answers to questions we never believed possible to answer seem to be developing every single day as research scientists work to provide us with new insights and revelations to our universe that break the boundaries of what we ever thought was possible these findings will often spawn new theories and Enlightenment's that will cause even the most stoic of people the need to sit back and collect their thoughts in order to come to terms with theories that are so mind-blowing they are often groundbreaking in their own right so today we will be visiting five theories about our very own universe that will absolutely blow your mind  we exist inside a black hole the Big Bang has been a scientific discovery that has led countless physicists and research scientists scratching their heads since its first appearance when scientists pointed their sensitive measuring devices towards the sky and picked up on the large quantities of background radiation of the universe that helped to paint an enlightening picture as to the original moments in time that our universe began more questions began popping into their heads than could be answered the most significant question seemed to be the most recursive if the Big Bang created the universe then what created the Big Bang this was a question that would go unanswered for many decades and many others attempting to abandon they thought altogether how can we see what happened before anything ever even happened this thought would soon change after mathematicians would make a strange comparison between the Big Bang and an unlikely celestial body that was still regarded as nothing more than theory  black holes now the theory behind black holes was more than just shrouded in mystery and it was not until a man by the recognizable name of Albert Einstein helped humanity to realize that space and time are interwoven and connected in something we refer to as the fabric of space-time interestingly enough the mathematical theory of mass then being able to stretch and distort this fabric similar to that of a rock resting on a cloth led to an innovative idea relative to the limits of this distortion it was in the math that scientists believed that if the mass of an object grew to a certain size this would cause the fabric of space-time to stretch and the mass although finite to be compressed into a zero dimensional point with no volume creating a singularity or as we commonly refer to as a black hole with a gravitational force so great that light itself couldn't escape it of course initially many scientists believed that an infinite density was impossible and that such an occurrence in the math was an obvious flaw that worked to prove the legitimacy of general relativity and that black holes could not possibly exist of course this would come to change in time as better technology has allowed us to observe the effects of gravitational distortion and the large supermassive black hole located at the center of our galaxy but an interesting comparison was made between the nature of black holes and the nature of the Big Bang in the meantime it became obvious to quantum physicists that the math completely added up that the Big Bang appeared to be the inverse perspective of the black hole leading many physicists to believe that the creation of our universe very well could have been the creation of a black hole and that existence and the stretching of space-time as we know in reference to the expansion of our universe could mainly be us existing inside of a singularity could it be possible then that we are merely a product of an outside aging universe and that the original creation of our universe was from this event further evidence is provided when plotting out the 4th dimensional graphing of the time line of our universe that shows a growing expanse from a singularity stretching out similar to an infinite density could stretch the fabric of space-time leading many more scientists to find this theory to be a legitimate answer to the question of the Big Bang  an infinite loop the world of infinite in mathematics have led to a tremendous amount of insights when discussing aspects of conceptual math none more so than the advancements made by Georg Cantor and fellow great mathematicians this had however led to many complications in the world of real world applications relative to the concepts of infinite a sphere in this regard could be considered an object with infinite points on its surface and when the math is worked out correctly one could in perfect mathematical theory create two perfect spheres with the same mass size and density of the original sphere this is referred to as the Banach tarsi paradox and though many scientists had initially regarded the concepts of this application as impossible in the real world the math was right it was not until many decades later that numerous researchers had begun noticing strange theories coming to light the CERN Institute during its testing of particle collisions and sub atomic particles breaking down began noticing a creation of more particles than initially started with in fact a paper had recently been published believing that not only was the Banach tarski paradox applicable in the real world but that many of the calculation errors and research at CERN helped to prove that this phenomenon was already naturally occurring if this research is correct it could mean that the traditionally held theories of the laws of conservation of energy could be entirely incorrect and that new particles could be cloned from existing particles naturally this alongside the existing mind-blowing theory that we exist inside a black hole could very well mean that every time a new black hole is created a universe imperfect copy of our own could be created as well this could very well mean that we are stuck in what appears to be an infinite loop as the universe forms and dies countless times and falls into a black hole and restarts all over again of course since the very laws of the universe our unchanging this would mean that all of the factors relative to creation would stay the same and ultimately create a universe that will play out exactly as our own could it be that you have seen this very video over a trillion times already regarding new theories it could very well be possible  multiverse theory one startling revelation made by quantum physicists that has converted even the most optimistic individuals into nihilists is the concept of the multiverse Theory when pondering the mathematical implications and probability of the universe forming as well as other theories in regard to dimensional mathematics physicists began positing a thought experiment forward why did our universe form with these specific rules with these specific numbers and laws of mathematics scientists believe that the odds of this occurring are so astronomical that is far from probable that every variation of every possible universe exists to allow such occurrences what is even more interesting is that researchers believe they have evidence of the multiverse theory occurring in the natural world given the complete probabilistic determination of quantum mechanics and its properties such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the formation of virtual particles this could very well mean that every possible variation of every universe and every decision ever made could more than exist and could potentially one day be explored philosophically this idea could lead to new outlooks of nihilism and absurdism that may lead people to discuss the meaningful implications of decisions if every possible decision exists infinitely throughout the multiverse making nothing unique meaningful or even significant in any possible way  last Thursday ISM continuing this idea in regards to a thought experiment put forth originally as a joke but now proven to be a legitimate point of debate last Thursday ISM explores further the absurdist crisis in regards to the multiverse theory and it's mathematics it states that everything that currently exists in the universe and that the universe itself was merely created last Thursday one could attempt to argue that there is inherent proof of time existing before this point and that the universe has indeed been around a lot longer than that but any evidence provided is not objective proof and is rather subjective interpretation if you have a video recording of a time before last Thursday one could argue that the device the data and everything merely popped into existence to give the illusion of the universe having been around much longer than it actually has this could be a counter argument for any point raised against the philosophies of last Thursday ISM which could include video evidence sensitive measuring equipments natural phenomenon occurring actions and even your own memories what is all the more mind-blowing about this theory is that it mathematically works given the concepts provided in the multiverse theory of every universe of every possible variation popping into existence it could very well be the case that our instance of space and time was merely created last Thursday and any other evidence to argue against the fact could merely have been popped into existence as well this concept ultimately argues that only the here and now is real and that only you could ever know that you exist this ultimately begs the question is anything we have ever experienced actually real or the product of a universe that just popped into existence last Thursday [Music]  given the mind-blowing theories we are quite certain that your mind is teeming with

Queenie Lee I recently completed an unsanctioned, unsupervised psychological experiment on my children, (Laughter) the premise of which was $10,000 in cash on the kitchen table and a sign next to it that said 'Don't touch the money yet!', and before I dive into it, you should know that we are a game-playing family. We play ball games, board games, dice games, card games, all sorts of games, but the games that my children love to play most are games like Monopoly, and when they play Monopoly, they play marathon games of Monopoly that last hours and hours over days of play. Each of my kids has a unique strategy and personality when they play Monopoly. My daughter, who is 11, she is always the dog. She plays entirely for Chance and Community Chest cards; (Laughter) you can say that she uses the 'luck' strategy. My 9-year-old son is always the car - a very strategic player. He buys all of the Railroads and all of the Utilities and then proceeds to put houses and hotels on the most expensive properties - very savvy. And then his younger brother, who is seven, he buys everything that he lands on with no exception, which is fitting because he is the wheelbarrow. Now, before I tell you how my experiment unfolded, I have to share an observation that led me to the creation of it. One Monopoly marathon, Saturday morning, I was playing with my kids and noticed that they were all playing just outside of the rules of the game. So they were doing things like buying each other out of jail and lending each other money to buy properties, and I found myself going, 'Guys, this is not how this game is played!' to which they'd say, 'Dad, it's fine! We just want her on the board with us', or, 'He can pay me back at the end of the game, when he's flush with cash', and I'm thinking again, 'What am I teaching these kids?' So, I started watching how they were playing - listening to their banter, getting a feel for how they were making decisions - and I had this thought: 'What if they're playing this way because the money isn't real?' It's a concept I've been reading a lot about, lately, 'Financial abstraction', the notion that when money becomes more and more of an idea, less tangible and therefore more abstract, it changes the way we interact with it on a regular basis, and there's anecdotal evidence of abstraction everywhere around us. All you have to do is listen carefully to people who say, 'I loaned my child or grandchild the phone, and a month later, all these errant in-app charges showed up on my bill.' In 2014, Apple reimbursed customers for in-app purchases that were unapproved, mostly by children, to the tune of $32.5 million. This is in a US FTC settlement. In the documentation, it said it was just too easy for kids to make an in-app purchase. The Imagineers at Disney were charged with making the parks 'frictionless' - is what they called it - so they invested a billion dollars in a MagicBand. It's a wearable device that functions as your room key, your park ticket, and your ID and wallet when you're on park property. So if your child wants a set of ears and a dessert in the Magic Kingdom, 'bibbidi-bobbidi-boo' - (Laughter) your vacation just cost a whole lot more, magically. Magically. Lastly, I had a conversation with some teenagers who told me that $100,000 a year really wasn't that much money. I said, 'Really? Why do you think that?' They said, 'Well, we both have $500,000 in our ATM machines on Grand Theft Auto', (Laughter) which is a very popular and somewhat sketchy video game. So as I'm playing with my kids and I'm watching them play, listening to them talk, I thought, 'What if the money were real on the table? Would they play differently?' And so I calculated quickly on the box, 'How much would it take in capital, in currency, to play a physical game of Monopoly with my kids so that they actually tangibly got to feel the money in their hands?' And I estimated, for four or five players, it's about $10,000. So one Friday, I stopped at the bank, I got all the denominations of bills on a Monopoly board with the exception of a $500 bill - hard to get - and on Sunday, I rounded the family up for a high-stakes game of Monopoly, (Laughter) where the winner takes all. All of $20, by the way. All of $20. You have never seen kids' eyes light up the way mine did when I handed each of them $1,500 in starter capital, and you have never seen anyone's eyes light up like my wife's when I took it back on Monday. (Laughter) All of it. Our marathon game only lasted two and a half hours - far shorter and more strategic than most of the games they normally play. True to my hypothesis, two of my three kids actually played differently; my daughter still played the 'luck' card. She was the first one bankrupted, (Laughter) and she happily retired to the living room to read a book. My youngest son, the wheelbarrow, did not buy everything he landed on; instead, he carefully calculated how many rolls away he was from one of his brother's properties and how much he would owe his brother if he landed on said property, and made his decisions based on that. In effect, having real money on the table and a cash prize at the end made him more conservative. And my middle son - very strategic - still bought all of the Railroads, still bought all of the Utilities, but did not buy Boardwalk and Park Place or Mayfair and Park Lane, but instead, he put hotels immediately on Oriental and Baltic Avenue, or Coventry and Leicester Square on the UK version. When I asked him why, in his own words, he said, 'Dad, they're just more affordable properties.' (Laughter) At which point, I cried a tear of pride. (Laughter) So he got it! In the end, my son finished with 28 properties, more cash than he'd ever seen and held in his entire life, and he now knows the meaning of the phrase 'making it rain'. (Laughter) Look how happy he is, (Laughter) and how annoyed his brother and sister are. In the confines of my experiment, there is an idea worth spreading, and it is this: I believe kids today are being raised in a world where money is no longer real; it's actually an illusion, but it has very real consequences. Peter Drucker, famed leadership guru, said banking and finance industries today are less about money and more about information, and yet young people today don't get that information; they don't get the experiences of money, early on. Three researchers from the Centre for Creative Leadership, in a study done two decades ago that's been replicated many, many times, they interviewed over 200 executives in a report called 'Key events in executives' lives'. In this report, they found that of the 200 top-level executives who were the top of their game, all of them had similar characteristics. One of them was that early on in their career, they had been thrust into a leadership role that required them to make decisions that had serious consequences. They also had a mentor in place that helped them appreciate the lessons they were supposed to learn from those experiences. The study created a leadership framework that said, in essence, that someone with potential, if given the opportunity to engage in strategically relevant experiences and given the ability to learn the lessons from those experiences, would have a higher likelihood of success in their career in a leadership capacity. Now if you took that study framework and my $10,000 experiment and looked at it through the kaleidoscope, you would get a statement like this: if kids are given financially-relevant experiences in their life and someone is there to help them learn the lessons from those experiences, they have a higher likelihood of achieving financial success later in life, and in my humble opinion, they need to have them early, and they need to have them often. We under this not-so-subtle societal shift in the way that we pay each other, today. It's estimated there are trillions of dollars circling the globe in our global economy every single day, yet only four percent of that money is actually in coin or currency. The rest is all digital, data packets, ones and zeroes, and today's digital-native youth - they don't see people paying with cash or cheques. In fact, if ever you're in a line, and someone in front pulls out their chequebook to pay, you are liable to say to yourself, 'Really, a chequebook? This is going to take forever.' You're laughing because it's true. The currency of today is digital. Many of these kids equate spending with credit and debit cards, with Google Wallet and Paypal and Zap. All of these are what they equate spending to, and by the way, I am not pooh-poohing the technological advancements in payment technology today - far from it. I think tokenisation and randomisation and biometrics are the wave of the future. The first time that I used Apple Pay, it was like showing the caveman fire. It was amazing. But what snapped me back to reality was hearing my son behind me say, 'I sure wish I had a phone so I could buy stuff.' (Laughter) You see, money, to a young person, is somewhat abstract, anyway, and when we further the abstraction by waving a MagicBand or putting our phone over a sensor and giving the thumbprint, all it does is further the abstraction. It's a recipe for financial disaster later in life to the uneducated because, to a young person, they see money as limitless because they have no concept of the backend until it comes around to bite them in the back end. I've seen this firsthand in my work with university students - young people who borrow and spend untold amounts of money, having no concept or understanding of the increase in payments, the decrease in lifestyle, and the challenges they'll face later on. In the UK and the US, student debt is ballooning problem. In the US, we're at $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, second only to mortgage debt in the US. One in three students is delinquent. One in five is in default. It's a huge problem, and the reason that this is concerning for all of us as a global economy is this: Dun & Bradstreet found that people spend 12 to 18 percent more when using credit cards over cash. They have yet to do a study how much more we'll spend with a MagicBand or a phone, but I can imagine it would be 15 to 20 percent, or 18 to 25 percent, and all you need to do is read the headlines in the newspapers and magazines across the world today. Places like The Guardian, The Washington Post, Fortune, Forbes - these are the headlines we're seeing: 'New consumer debt reaching a seven-year high' in the UK, 'Consumer debt hitting an all-time high' in the US, 'Choking on credit card debt', 'The credit card debt crisis: the next economic domino'. It's what happens when people overspend and get in over their head with money. Unfortunately, The Money Charity says that in the UK right now, one person every five minutes and three seconds is either declared insolvent or bankrupt. To put this into perspective, since I started speaking today, two people in this country have declared bankruptcy. In the UK, Demos.org says that Americans aged 25 to 34 have the second highest rate of bankruptcy. 25-year-olds. Everyone's question should be, 'Why? Why is this happening?', and in my simplistic view, it is this: because the money they're spending isn't real - it's an abstraction. So to stem this tide with the next generation, we have to bring them up to understand that they are living in a world where they have to make very real money decisions, in a world money is largely an illusion but has very, very real consequences. Because I want your children and mine to be super successful financially, consider any of the following: If you are going to spend money on children, give them a set amount of money and let them spend it. Let them tangibly feel the money go through their hands. Let them succeed or fail with minor consequences so that later in life, when they're making the major decisions, they understand there are major consequences that go along. For older kids, it's this: set a budgeted amount for school clothes, supplies and what-have-you, give them that amount, and when they are done spending it, it's done. And here's the key; they get to spend it with your subtle guidance, your subtle mentorship, your subtle supervision, and whether you call it an allowance, you call it commission for chores or you call it a weekly stipend, every single child, from the age of five on up, needs to be given some tangible amount of money on a weekly basis so that they understand how to function in a cashless society someday. Better to teach the young the habit of saving when they have a little bit of money to save than try to teach savings when they have no money because they're in over their head. I met an American named Jos\u00c3\u00a9. He was a 20-year-old student at an American university. He was the child of two Cuban-born parents. At the age of 15, his parents told him, 'Jos\u00c3\u00a9, we will give you food, we will give you shelter and we will give you $50 a month, but the rest is up to you.' I asked him, 'What was that like?' He said, 'Clothing, toiletries, school supplies, entertainment, gas - it was all on me. I resented my parents for a year. But you know what? I realised it was the single best thing they could have ever done for me.' When I met Jos\u00c3\u00a9 at 20, he was on a full-ride scholarship at the university he attended. He had $20,000 saved in a savings account from working part-time in high school, and this kid exuded financial prowess and unmistakable leadership potential. At the heart of my message today is this: it does not take a $10,000 board game and it doesn't take cutting kids off financially to make a difference. The first step is, honestly, quite easy. It's about educating the next generation to make decisions in a world where money is largely an illusion but has very, very real consequences, and the reason it's so important for all of us, as a global society, to do this is this next generation coming up will inherit the global economy that we are handing to them, and we will precariously place it on their shoulders. We owe it to them to set them up for financial success. Thank you. (Applause) Thanks. (Applause)", "AxhObEpZcp0": "People have done well so far discovering the earth by climbing mountains and to cross continents and place our flags everywhere in the name of science But a part of the world that is still mysterious consists of more than 70% of the surface: the ocean. Yes, we are often in danger. And drilled in it for oil. And have made reality shows about fishing in it. But, from glowing oceans to huge deep-sea creatures, and underwater ecosystems with thousands of undiscovered, actually extraterrestrial beings - we still have a lot to learn about it. Probably more than other places on earth, the ocean is full of fascinating things that we just don't know. Not yet. Number 1: how is the ocean bottom? In fact, we still don't know exactly what the ocean floor looks like in most places. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that 95% of the ocean floor is unseen stays by people. As a result, we have a better picture of the surfaces of other planets than we have of most of the seabed. In 2014, scientists created a map of the seabed with data from satellites with special sensors called radar altimeters. These instruments could precisely measure the distance from the satellite to the surface of the ocean below. Every big mountain or gorge in the ocean has a little bit of gravity effect on the ocean surface, which causes bumps and indentations. These variations are too subtle to see with the naked eye, but they can be measured through these ultra-precise satellite altimeters - and tell, after adjusting for the effect of drifting and the tide, scientists what's on the seabed. This map contains the entire ocean floor, which is fantastic, and we are all happy that it exists, but it only has a resolution of 5 kilometers, which is quite low. In comparison, the surfaces of Mars, Venus and the moon have been mapped with resolutions from 100 meters or less. So, if we want to know what's going on down there and really want to discover the ocean, track it down life, specific mineral formations, or wrecks, we need a better map. Number 2: what's under the seabed? OK, you probably think you know what's under it: brick. That's right. But not just stone. In 2015, scientists reported that they were 2.5 kilometers below the seabed had bored along the coast of Japan, and discovered living microbes there. There were only 10 to 10,000 microorganisms in a cubic centimeter of sediment what they studied, compared to meards that you normally find in the same amount of soil from you garden. But still: there is life down there, even in the intense heat and pressure many kilometers below where the ocean ends. And the genomes of these submarine microbes showed that they were more similar the kind that you find in woodland, then the one in the seabed. So it is possible that these microbes are descended from the terrestrial of 20 million years ago, who adjusted when their habitat was buried under the ocean. So, who knows what other life forms exist deep in the seabed, or what can they tell us about what life on earth looked like? Number 3: Brine water. We have all seen lakes and rivers on land, but also lakes ... underwater? It sounds unreal that it might come from an episode of Spongebob, but they really do exist - parts of seawater that have a different composition than the surrounding ocean: because they are super salty. They are known as brine water, and they seem to have originated when layers of salt evaporated oceans were buried millions of years ago under layers of sediment. Seawater can reach these deposits and mix with the salt, which forms a dense brine flows from the seabed, sometimes filled with oil or methane gas. Some brine waters, as found deep in the Gulf of Mexico, are 4 times as salty like the ocean water around it. And the brine is so dense that dive boats can even float on it, such as one boat on a lake. All this salt makes brine water fatal for larger animals. But colonies of halophilic - or salt-loving - microorganisms can flourish there, often in much higher concentrations than in the normal seawater around it. Some brine waters are surrounded by mussels with symbiotic bacteria in their gills use the methane in the brine to generate energy for the mussels. But there's a lot we don't know about these weird underwater salt lakes - like how brine waters are so different from each other - and why some have mussels and others not - and even how many there are! Number 4: Lights from the sea Lights from the sea is a phenomenon involving thousands of square kilometers light up white blue from the ocean surface. It only takes so short, and so few are recorded, that these rising seas were seen as a myth invented by crazy sailors ... ... until 2005 - when a group of researchers were viewing satellite photos from the Indian Ocean from 1995. These photos showed an area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u203915,000 square kilometers, as large as Connecticut, that glowed 3 nights. It was the first scientific evidence of the phenomenon, but the glowing waters are still misunderstood. Some suggested that the lighting is caused by a multitude of small dinoflagellates called Noctiluca scintillans known as \"sea spark\" because they light up if they are disturbed. These protists are the cause of the scenic glitter waves along the shores of some sharing in the world. But the 2005 study found that it was \"unlikely or impossible\" that it was short-lived Glowing dinoflagellates is what scientists had seen from space. The current theory is that the Lights of the sea are caused by massive colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that grow on top of an algal bloom. But we are not yet sure how or why these short-lived masses of bacteria collect, glow, and disappear. Number 5: the 52 hertz whale. You would think we know a lot about whales. I mean, they are big, and we have their skeletons, and we can observe their migration patterns. But what we still have to learn about are their songs - why some whales they make how an animal without vocal cords .. or lips .. can make song-like sounds. And then there is the question - what produces the 52 hertz song, and why? This whale song was first noticed on 7-12-1992 in the northeastern Pacific ocean. It sounded like a blue whale, but blue whale calls are usually between 15 and 20 hertz in pitch. So, blue whales in the Pacific ocean normally sound like this: [blue whale sound] But the song of this whale, played at the same speed, sounded like this: [52 hertz song] This high tone seems to belong specifically to 1 animal - a whale that became known as 52 Blue. This raised many questions, and we first need to know more about whales for some questions to be able to answer. Like, why does this one whale sound different? And can others hear it? And if they can hear it, do they understand? Some people got the idea that 52 Blue is a lonely whale calling to others who do not hear or do not answer. But several scientists have rejected this idea, and think other whales understand his call even though they cannot make the call themselves. In addition, 52 Blue seems to be migrating separately from other whales. But his migration patterns are similar to those of blue whales - scientists have been following the North Pacific Ocean for years from Alaska to Mexico. So some researchers think it has a malformation that makes it sing differently, or maybe it's a cross between a blue whale and another species. Whether it is a lonely whale or not, 52 Blue is a stranger that people seem to love. Number 6: Whip Ocean sounds have their own study area. \"NOAA\" has the last one observed the ocean sounds for decades. Instead of microphones used to record sound in the air, NOAA uses hydrophones to record underwater sounds. These hydrophones are often used to listen to the surrounding sounds of the ocean how people disrupt it, and to listen to things like earthquakes and whale shouts. And sometimes they record things that are hard to explain - at least for a while. For example in 1997, there was something known as the \"Bloop\", an extremely hard, low-frequency sound that was recorded by hydrophones that were 5000 km apart. Oceanographers recently decided that it was due to an ice quake - the breaking and collapse of glaciers in the ocean, in this case off the coast of Antarctica But there is still a mysterious sound of the ocean, it is known as the \"Upsweep\". Recorded in August 1991, it sounds like a repeating \"boop\" at the end goes up - a bit like the \"red alarm\" sound you hear on spaceships in sci-fi movies. But instead of trying to describe it, I can also play it for you: [Boop sound] This sound has been heard regularly in the Pacific Ocean since 1991, and seems to be seasonal, it is more common in spring and fall. Researchers have followed the sound to a part of the Pacific that is much volcanic and seismic activity, which appear to be important indications. But according to the NOAA \"the origin of the sound is not yet clear\". Number 7: why are deep-sea creatures so large? From the Kraken to sea dragons, all of our favorite mythical sea creatures are huge. And in fact, many of the deep-sea creatures are also unusually large in real life. This phenomenon is called \"deep sea giant\". But what makes it come ... you guessed it ... is unknown. In the deep sea, and especially near the polar oceans, some animals seem to grow very big - such as colossal squids, giant woodlice beds and Japanese spider crabs. Scientists don't know exactly why, but they have some ideas. For example, there is the Bergmann rule, which suggests that temperature can have an effect on giantism. This may be because larger animals have relatively less surface area than volume they lose less heat based on their mass and stay warmer in cold climates. And there is Klieber's law, which says more massive animals in general lower metabolism - and therefore need less quality food to survive. There are also other theories that suggest that gigantism helps withstand great pressure from the deep sea. But we don't really have a good biological reason why these giant animals exist. So, the ocean is full of mysteries, perhaps because it is so huge and dark and deep. But so that you know that we are not hyping you - we are not saying these 7 topics things that Science Cannot Explain. You should see it as reminders of how much we still have to learn about the ocean. If our technology improves and our access to the ocean gets more depth, we will being able to see and hear more than ever before. So over time, these puzzles will be solved and new animals discovered, and our understanding of our planet and life on it will be so much deeper.

I understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago when my wife and I became new parents. It was an amazing moment. It was exhilarating and elating, but it was also scary and terrifying. It got particularly terrifying when we got home from the hospital. We were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding. We wanted to call our paediatrician, but we also didn't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy neurotic parent, so we worried and we waited. When we got to the doctor's office the next day, she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated. Our son is fine now, and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her. But in that moment, I should have spoken up, but I didn't. But sometimes we speak up when we shouldn't. I learned that over ten years ago when I let my twin brother down. My twin brother is a documentary filmmaker, and for one of his first films, he got an offer from a distribution company. He was excited and he was inclined to accept the offer, but as a negotiations researcher, I insisted he make a counteroffer, and I helped him craft the perfect one. It was perfect; it was perfectly insulting. The company was so offended they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing. I've ask people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up: when they can assert themselves, when they can push their interest, when they can express an opinion, when they can make an ambitious ask. The range of stories are varied and diverse but they also make up a universal tapestry. \"Can I correct my boss when they make a mistake?\" \"Can I confront my co-worker who keeps stepping on my toes?\" \"Can I challenge my friend\\'s insensitive joke?\" \"Can I tell the person I love the most my deepest insecurities?\" Through these experiences, I've come to recognize that each of us have something called \"a range of acceptable behavior.\" Sometimes, we're too strong; we push ourselves too much. That's what happened with my brother. Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior. But sometimes we're too weak. That's what happened with my wife and I. This range of acceptable behaviors, when we stay within our range, we're rewarded, and we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways: we get dismissed, or demeaned, or even ostracized, or we lose that raise, or that promotion, or that deal. Now, the first thing we need to know is: \"What is my range?\" But the key thing is, our range isn't fixed. It's actually pretty dynamic. It expands and it narrows based on the context. There's one thing that determines that range more than anything else. That's your power. Your power determines your range. What is power? Power comes in lots of forms. In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives. So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power. The company had lots of alternatives; they had power. Or sometimes being new to a country like an immigrant, or new to an organization, or new to an experience like my wife and I as new parents. Sometimes it's at work, or someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate. Sometimes it's in relationships where one person is more invested than the other person. The key thing is, when we have lots of power, our range is very wide. We have a lot of leeway in how to behave. But when we lack power, our range narrows. We have very little leeway. The problem is when our range narrows, that produces something called \"the low-power double bind.\" The low-power double bind happens when if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished. Now, many of you have heard the phrase \"the double bind\" and connected it with one thing, and that's gender. The gender double bind is: women who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished. The key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so. But what my research has shown over the last two decades is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind; it's really a low-power double bind. What looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise. Oftentimes, we see a difference between a man and a woman or men and women, and we think biological cause, there's something fundamentally different about the sexes. But in study after study, I found that a better explanation for many sex differences is really \"power.\" So it's the low-power double bind, and the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range and we lack power; we have a narrow range and our double bind is very large. So, we need to find ways to expand our range. Over the last couple of decades, my colleagues and I have found two things really matter. The first, you seem powerful in your own eyes. The second, you seem powerful in the eyes of others. When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful, and I expand my own range. When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range. So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior. I'm going to give you a set of tools today. Now, speaking up is risky. But these tools will lower your risk of speaking up. The first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations. An important finding: on average, women make less ambitious offers, and gets worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table. But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as man and are just as ambitious. That's when they advocate for others. When they advocate for others, they discover their own range, and expand it in their own mind. They become more assertive. This is sometimes called the \"mama bear effect.\" Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice. But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves. How do we do that? One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called \"perspective-taking.\" Perspective-taking is really simple. It's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person. It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range. When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me what I really want. But here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do. Let's do a little experiment. I want you all to hold your hand just like this, your finger, put it up. I want you to draw a capital letter \"E\" on your forehead as quickly as possible. Okay. It turns out that we can draw this \"E\" in one of two ways and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking. I\\'m going to show you two pictures of someone with \"E\" on their forehead. My former student Erica Hall. You can see over here, that\\'s the correct \"E\". I drew the \"E\" so it looks like an \"E\" to another person. That\\'s the perspective-taking \"E,\" because it looks like an \"E\" from someone else\\'s vantage point. But this \"E\" over here is the self-focused \"E.\" We often get self-focused and we particularly get self-focused in a crisis. I want to tell you about a particular crisis. A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California. He says, \"Give me $2,000, or I\\'m blowing the bank up with a bomb.\" The bank manager didn't give him the money. She took a step back; she took his perspective. She noticed something really important. He asked for a specific amount of money. So she said, \"Why did you ask for $2,000?\" He said, \"My friend is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately. She said, \"Oh, you don\\'t want to rob the bank. You want to take out a loan.\" (Laughter) \"Come back to my office and we can have you fill out the paperwork.\" (Laughter) Now, her quick perspective-taking diffused a volatile situation. When we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable. Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable. That is to signal flexibility. Imagine you're a car salesperson and you want to sell someone a car. You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options. Let's say, option A: $24,000 for this car, and a five-year warranty. Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty. My research shows that when you give people a choice among options, it lowers their defences, and they're more likely to accept your offer. This doesn't just work with salespeople; it works with parents. When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything. But then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea. \"What if I gave my daughter a choice?\" \"This shirt or that shirt?\" \"Okay, that shirt.\" \"This pant or that pant?\" \"Okay, that pant.\" That worked brilliantly. She got dressed quickly, and without resistance. When I've asked the question around the world, when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: \"When I have social support in my audience.\" \"When I have allies.\" So, we want to get allies on our side. How do we do that? One of the ways is to be a \"mama bear.\" When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes and in the eyes of others but we also earn strong allies. Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice. When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them and we're expressing humility. This really works to solve another double bind. That's the self-promotion double bind. The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, no one notices, and if we do, we're not likable. But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent in their eyes, but also be likable. This is so powerful. It even works when you see it coming. There've been multiple times in my life where I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice. There are three things about this: First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice; Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice; And three, it still works! I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them, because they asked for advice. Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up is when we have expertise. Expertise gives us credibility. When we have high power, we already have credibility. We only need good evidence. We lack power, we don't have the credibility, we need excellent evidence. One of the ways that we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion. I want everyone in the next few days to go up to a friend of theirs, and just say to them, \"I want you to describe a passion of yours to me.\" I've had people do this all over the world, and I asked them, \"What did you notice about the other person when they described their passion?\" The answers are always the same. \"Their eyes lit up and got big.\" \"They smiled, a big beaming smile.\" \"They use their hands all over; I had to duck because their hands were coming at me.\" \"They talk quickly with a higher pitch.\" (Laughter) And, \"They leaned in as if telling me a secret.\" Then I said to them, \"What happened to you as you listen to their passion?\" They said. \"My eyes lit up. I smiled; I leaned in.\" When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage in our own eyes to speak up, but we also get the permission from others to speak up. Tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak. Both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears. But Lizzy Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women. I want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother's wedding. Here's a picture of us. My dad was a psychologist like me, but his real love and his real passion was cinema, like my brother. He wrote a speech for my brother's wedding about the roles we play in the human comedy. He said, \"The lighter your touch, the better you become at improving and enriching your performance. Those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow, change, and expand the self. Play it well, and your days will be mostly joyful.\" What my dad was saying is that we've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world. But he was also saying the essence of this talk. Those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving. So, when a scene calls for it, be a ferocious mama bear, and a humble advice seeker. Have excellent evidence and strong allies. Be a passionate perspective taker. If you use those tools - and each and every one of you can use these tools - you'll expand your range of acceptable behavior and your days will be mostly joyful. Thank you.

still a little dirty from my son's little antics with the you know the the big top cupcake scene yeah you know how that turned out anyway I still have some some cupcake cream in my eye so that hat is drying I had to wash it but we are back with another episode it's time to start getting back into some some lessons that's right we've done product reviews we've gone on field trips we've done we've done specialty holiday events right now I want to start teaching you guys some some tips and tricks okay so every so often I'm gonna do an episode that's gonna teach you something whether it's parboiling or whether it's butterflying or whether it's just things that you see on cooking shows that you're like what are they talking about alright here's a little trick right now for those of you who eat steak or any kind of a cut of beef or any meat whatsoever I guess this would work on I've only tried it on steak so far okay it's called the poor man's filet mignon and what that does it's a way of taking a really and I'm gonna be just honest a really tough cheap piece of garbage steak okay and making it tender and amazing falls apart I mean you could probably pull it apart with your fingers instead of a knife and a fork so we're gonna show you this it's really cool my brother called me one day goes Jack Jack here I sending a link check this out online there's this cool method of tenderizing your meat before you cook it and it only takes about between one to two hours depending how thick your meat is it could be as little as 15 minutes so let's uh let's show you how I went to the store and I bought the cheapest piece of garbage they had on sale yeah so cheap all right it was a dollar ninety-nine a pound it's all I could find there was ninety nine cents a pound I would've brought that home but it's called what is a select beef cross rib roast I don't know what that is I don't know bones in it anyway let me show you how to do this we're gonna do a side-by-side comparison I had the butcher take a thick piece and slice it right in the middle so we have two pieces of the same mistake all right so there's no question about this test if one comes out more tender than the other they're from the same steak okay all right so let's take a look all right to clean pans we're gonna open up these steaks but one and eat don't forget to wash your hands you haven't washed your hands now's a good time to go wash your hands all right  okay once again I took one piece of meat and I had the butcher slice it right down the middle okay so there would be the same cut of meat ah beautiful I love beef as you can tell it just looks good so many things you can do with it you can cook it a million different ways this is not a good cut of beef okay I'm just telling that right now okay next thing you're gonna do is you're going to take sea salt or kosher salt and that's a very coarse salt and we're gonna take that we're gonna cover one of them completely with sea salt all right so let's do that right now okay so we're gonna do this now the rule is this find out how thick your steak is ours it's about an inch and a half okay so you're gonna have to leave this on an inch is an hour so an inch and a half would be an hour and a half once again every inch is an hour you leave this salt on if it's half an inch then you do half an hour quarter of an inch quarter of an hour all right don't be afraid to put too much on because we're gonna wash this right off when we're done but this is going to do something to the meat it's really interesting there we go I got the whole thing covered a little bit more down here all right there we go I don't know why this works I'm sure something you do and you can write me in and tell me but what's gonna happen is it's gonna pull the moisture out of this meat and it's also going to do something to the protein molecules it's gonna break them down and what's gonna happen is this simple piece of meat as you can see it's pretty it's pretty tough see how it doesn't there's no openings okay you can pull it apart okay this is gonna open up the meat it does something for the protein molecules I don't know the science to it I just know it works and I'm just gonna show you guys right now so we're gonna let this set for let's break out my measuring tape that is about you know what that's about a an inch and a quarter so we're gonna do an hour and 15 minutes okay I'll be back in an hour and 15 minutes to show you exactly one pock mouth notice there's no moisture or water in there just the salt no moisture or water in this one all right let's check this out in an hour and 15 minutes you're watching the cooking with Jack show we'll be right back right after this message hey how you doing jack sky Lonnie here just want to tell you about my line of sauces they're called the best sauces you'll ever taste that's right it's called the best barbecue sauce you'll ever taste here's the best hot barbecue sauce over taste the best teriyaki sauce you'll ever taste and the best gourmet seasoning you'll ever taste all of them come with a money-back guarantee and if you live in the United States of America I give you free shipping I'm pleased to announce that my friends in the great white north in Canada I have now set up an order page for Canadian orders I don't do free shipping but now Canadians can order the sauces too go check it out go to the best sauces com I'll see you there and now back to the cooking with Jack show it's been an hour and 15 minutes and you can see that all the salt has has really become moist it's pulling it's drawing all the water out of it you can also see if you'd if we turn this let me move this one over a little bit if you turn this you could see like the salt a lot of moisture down in there collecting and you can see where the water is coming out of the steak it's just it's just coming right out of the bottom so it's doing something to this meat so we're going to take both of these and get them prepared for cooking all right first thing you do is rinse the entire day of salt there we go get all the salt off it and look but you notices see all those openings look at all those groove openings it's starting to kind of kind of pull apart a little bit here it's really penetrated the mean get a good rinse now you can see it's it's right kind of very loose feeling I'll show you at the other at the table okay let's look up difference in the meat okay take a look at how this this has been not treated how it kind of just looks straight out of the butcher counter okay and look at this this is a lot more falling apart you can already see the grooves look at the separation you see that separation right there the separation right in there all these grooves that are created it just seems to be falling apart in my hands it's not quite as firm yeah we turn it the right way there we go there you go okay seems to have opened up the meat it's really interesting so there you go now we take these out we're gonna grill these now once this is clean of salt season both of these is however you want I'm gonna season them up then take them out to the grill bring them right back and then we're gonna do a taste test see if this opened up and got more tender than this one okay you just came off the grill I want to show you some similarities and some differences okay now I noticed while cooking these these were cooked on over their own flame each one had a flame underneath it on the barbecue they were cooked identically the same position same amount of time I pulled them off but the weird thing is the untreated one looks like it curled up a little bit right on this end and I don't we can see it but it kind of curled up and it kind of looked like it cooked overcooked or got well done but look at this one right here this one's interesting because this still I like my steak rare this looks rare and this looks well-done they look completely different if they look like they were quickly different completely different times so one more thing I want to do before I want to lift these up and which one has more juice before we cut into it okay okay this one definitely has more juice than this one but we're gonna cut into these bad boys right now let me bring over a plate this is the one season with the salt this is one not seasoned with the salt I'm gonna cut right into him we're gonna see exactly how they cooked oh yeah nice and rare okay that's beautiful let's take a look at this one same spot same thing you'd they're both beautiful let's take a look now and see let's see if one's more tender than the other I'm gonna try and rip this tear this meat open with my fingers it's pretty easy little nervy I like that was a little tougher than I thought but you can do it now let's go over here and look at this same spot that goes right through Wow that was beautiful that was a lot easier now I think if you left the salt on a little bit longer you would even have a better a better tenderizing procedure all right so here's the deal um take a piece of meat here Wow I know what I'm having for dinner there's one piece there don't want the same size here so we try this right now we let the meat set it should be perfect this is the untreated good seasoning Wow lots of pepper forgive me mmm I love black pepper okay it's really got a lot of flavor but it immediately toughen up almost all the juices out of it and it's now becoming harder to show now the treater one mmm this is more like a New York steak I think we've upgraded to a New York steak right here mmm it's breaking up real easy it definitely makes a difference I've done this before but I had to share with you guys mmm delicious I'm gonna get a little a1 I'm gonna sit down with these steaks and we're gonna have a conversation go you guys try it out write me send me pictures tell me I'm not lying please all right I'll see you on the next cooking with Jack take care [Music] [Applause]", "1hYYdmjuDac": "10 Fascinating Attempts at Creating Perpetual Motion 10. Boyle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Self-Flowing Flask One of the simplest ideas for a perpetual motion machine comes from the 17th century Irish chemist and physicist Robert Boyle. His design is simply to have a tank of water with a hose on the bottom that runs water from the tank directly back into the same tank. Of course, this system doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work because gravity doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work that way. For water to leave the tank, it needs to flow to a container that is lower than the original one. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe us, you can test this with materials around your home or you can easily buy some at a dollar store. But what if there was a chemical fluid that could be used that constantly reacted and pushed the liquid through the hose? For example, in the video above, the YouTuber tries beer (good choice!) and it at least pushes liquid through the hose. The problem is that the cycle would stop when the beer stops carbonating. However, again, finding a chemical that never stops reacting is just as impossible as creating any other type of perpetual motion machine. 9. Monopole Magnet Magnets have two poles, north and south, and opposite poles pull magnets together while the same poles push them apart. But there are also hypothetical monopole magnet particles that would only have one pole. In 2014, researchers created synthetic monopole magnet particles, 85 years after they were first theorized. Despite them only recently being discovered, some YouTubers claim to have built or bought one, and there are some magnets that are claimed to be monopole on Alibaba. Of course, we have to say, buyer beware. If we could construct monopole magnets, they could possibly lead to free energy. In the video for this entry, a man creates a supposed free energy machine using a few dollars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of material from a hardware store and a monopole magnet he bought on eBay. He hammers two nails into a board, and cuts tiny slits in the nails to hold the wire that is formed into a ring. In between the two nails and under the ring, he places the magnet, which causes the coiled wire to spin, creating energy. The biggest problem with this type of machine, besides the lack of scientific evidence that monopole magnets are real, is that there is too much friction on the materials so they would have to be replaced, meaning this would never be a true perpetual motion machine. 8. Rolling Ball Wheel This attempt at a perpetual motion machine was designed by German mathematician, scientist, and physicist Jacob Leupold and the design was published in his Theatrum Machinarum Generale Vol. 1 in 1724. The machine uses an overbalancing wheel and rolling balls. The idea is that the balls will always be rolling, which shifts the weight of the wheel, and gravity simply takes over. Sadly, while it may sound like this might work in theory, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t because it needs external help to keep moving. 7. Water Mill and Pump It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believed designs for the water mill and pump perpetual motion machine, and variations of it, have been around since the 1600s, and quite possibly earlier than that. The idea is that water falls from the top of the machine, which makes the water mill turn, and that ultimately powers the pump that brings the water back to the top, creating a cycle of energy. The problem is that there is too much friction involved with the design and it actually doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work outside of computer models. So, back the old drawing board, we suppose? Geez, you expect better out of your 17th century scientific theorists. 6. Paul Scheerbart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Weight-Driven Cogwheel German born Paul Scheerbart wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a mathematician or an engineer like many of the other inventors on this list. Instead, he was a writer known for his work in the fantastic genre. Despite a lack of formal training, Scheerbart spent two and a half years trying to build a perpetual motion machine in the laundry room of his house. His machine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which looks strangely familiar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was finally revealed in 1910 in his book The Perpetual Motion Machine: The Story of an Invention. The system uses one giant wheel and two sets of smaller rollers and a weight. The problem with his design, like many other perpetual motion machines, is that the main cogwheel needs external power to keep its momentum. That being said, it is still the best perpetual motion machine designed by a fiction writer. 5. Magnets and Gravity A physical constant on Earth is gravity, which is bad news if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a terrible yet dedicated tightrope walker, but it is good news in terms of creating perpetual motion machines because it is a constant source of force. An attempt at a perpetual motion machine that utilizes that force is the perpetual wheel that was patented in 1823. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly simple set up: a large wheel is turned by a small iron ball that is being pulled towards the magnet. While the video above may look like this is feasible, the wheel does not actually spin like that without external help; also, after some time, magnets become demagnetized, meaning it is not an unlimited source of energy. 4. Force of Gravity Perpetual Motion Machine This so-called perpetual motion machine uses two vertical rods. The rod at the center is straight, but the second one is tilted. Then there are three horizontal bars that run across the two vertical bars, connecting both vertical rods. Finally, there is a weight that is attached to the center rod. This means that the counter-clockwise torque and clockwise torque are equal, and since the torques are the same, the vertical rod pushes more on the bottom arm than it does on the top arm. Since the top and bottom rods are the same distance from the vertical axles, there is more torque pushing one way than the other, allowing the system to spin. A writer at Wired analyzed this specific video and believes there are hidden motors in the machine. If there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then he believes the spin is caused by angular momentum and torque. That means it would spin for a while, but not perpetually. 3. Neodymium Magnets The strongest batteries commercially available are neodymium magnets, which were developed by General Motors in 1982. This design takes advantage of these batteries and creates momentum by placing magnets with the same poles against each other on a wheel. When two magnets with the same pole meet, they push each other apart and in this case, it spins the wheel. A bonus with this design is that it is frictionless, which is an especially big bonus over other proposed perpetual motion machines because friction leads to entropy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the machine will eventually slow down. The main reason this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a true perpetual motion machine is because the magnets will eventually stop working and will need to be replaced. 2. Perepiteia Thane Heins is a Canadian college dropout who has been working on a perpetual motion machine called Perepiteia since 1985. Heins is so dedicated to the machine that he says that he lost his wife and custody over his two children over it. So, you know, his priorities may be slightly skewed. Nevertheless, Heins says he is so dedicated because he claims that the machine has the ability to generate a large amount of power from a little electrical input, thought to be impossible. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting is that the tests show that the generator somehow turns magnetic friction into a magnetic boost, which causes the motor to accelerate, creating a positive feedback loop. If the tests are correct, that would mean that Perepiteia breaks the first law of thermodynamics. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a light bulb that powers itself using energy from its own light. In 2008, Heins showed Perepiteia to MIT professor Markus Zahn, who is an expert in electromagnetic and electronic systems. Zahn said Perepiteia originally stumped him and the machine was definitely worth looking into. But, he later clarified it was not a perpetual motion machine because it needed to be plugged into the wall. Yet Zahn says that the machine still could be an important discovery that could improve motors. Although there are many skeptics, Heins is hoping that his invention will lead to electrical cars that power themselves through accelerating and braking. 1. Finsrud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Perpetuum Mobile A lot of these proposed machines are fairly simplistic and use a minimal amount of parts. On the other end of the spectrum is a supposed perpetual motion machine by Norwegian sculptor and mathematician Reidar Finsrud. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a complicated system that uses a wheel, magnets, and pendulums. Its system ensures the wheel is always dipping, so the ball, which is pulled by magnets, is always rolling around the track. Supposedly during testing done over the course of three days, the ball maintained a constant speed measured to 1/25 of a second. An engineer who studied the machine said it could maintain 80-90 percent efficiency, while most devices, like a combustion engine, only have 30-50 percent efficiency. Finsrud claims that his machine has an efficiency rate of over 100 percent, and therefore it creates free energy. Finsrud believes that his machine, if built to the proper scale, could provide free energy to the world. He is also worried his machine might be too revolutionary, so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forced to keep it locked in a safe in his basement. So while it may not be a true perpetual motion machine, it is an impressive feat of engineering.", "UygnXqoKrC4": "the message you are about to hear was written and recorded on a record in 1956 by Earl Nightingale this message is the answer to the question that he had been searching for from the time he was about nine years old Earl Nightingale had been born and economically depressed times as a child because they were so poor Earl desperately wanted to know why some people grew up to enjoy prosperity while others like his family struggled merely to survive unable to find answers to his questions from grownups girl began reading everything he could believing that someone somewhere had the answer many years passed and when Earl was 35 years old he wrote and recorded this message it was to be played one Saturday morning to a small group of salesmen during his absence when Earl returned he learned that the message had made such a positive impact on the men they wanted copies to share with their friends and family Earl arranged with Columbia Records to duplicate the record to meet the many requests much to Earl's surprise in very little time without any real advertising or

in 1989 i have continually looked for new effective ways to continue to share Earle's many messages of inspiration with the world the personal development industry is so vast today and yet people around the world attribute the strangest secret as being the one message that has most positively affected their lives brill revised the strangest secret several times over the past 40 years as times changed because of these changes I believe you will appreciate the historic value of this original recording as you listen you will notice how the statistics reflect those of the mid-1950s you'll also hear Earl mention the other side of the record but 40 years later the message is as true and valuable as it was then now I invite you to sit back relax and enjoy the original the strangest secret by Earl Nightingale  I'd like to tell you about the strangest secret in the world not long ago Albert Schweitzer the great doctor and Nobel Prize winner was being interviewed in London and a reporter asked him doctor what's wrong with men today the great doctor was silent a moment and then he said men simply don't think and it's about this that I want to talk with you we live today in a golden age this is an era that man has looked forward dreamed of and worked toward for thousands of years but since it's here we pretty well take it for granted we in America are particularly fortunate to live in the richest land that ever existed on the face of the earth a land of abundant opportunity for everyone but do you know what happens let's take a hundred men who start even at the age of 25 do you have any idea what will happen to those men by the time they're 65 these 100 men who all start even at the age of 25 believe they're going to be successful if you ask any one of these men if he wanted to be a success he'd tell you that he did and you'd notice that he was eager toward life that there was a certain sparkle to his eye and erectus to his carriage and life seemed like a pretty interesting adventure to him but by the time they're 65 one will be rich four will be financially independent five will still be working fifty four will be broke now think a moment out of the 100 only five make the grade why do so many fail what has happened to these Sparkle that was there when they were 25 what's become of the dreams the hopes the plans and why is there such a large disparity between what these men intended to do and what they actually accomplished when we say about five percent achieve success we have to define success and here's the definition success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal if a man is working toward a predetermined goal and knows where he's going that man is a success if he's not doing that he's a failure success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal Rallo may the distinguished psychiatrist wrote a wonderful book called and search for himself and in this book he says the opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice it is conformity and there you have the trouble today its conformity people acting like everyone else without knowing why without knowing where they're going now think of it in America right now there are over 14 million people 65 years of age and over and about 13 million of these 14 million are broke they're dependent on someone else for life's necessities now we learn to read by the time we're 7 we learn to make a living by the time we're 25 usually by that time we're not only making a living we're supporting a family and yet by the time we're 65 we haven't learned how to become financially independent in the richest land that has ever been known why we can form and the trouble is that we're acting like the wrong percentage group the ninety five percent who don't succeed now why do these people conform well they don't know really these people believe that their lives are shaped by circumstances by things that happen to them by exterior forces their outer directed people a survey was made one time that covered a lot of men working man and these men were asked this question why do you work why do you get up in the morning 19 out of 20 had no idea if you ask them they'll say everyone goes to work in the morning and that's the reason they do it because everyone else is doing it now let's get back to our definition of success who succeeds the only man who succeeds is the man who is progressively realizing a worthy ideal he's the man who says I'm going to become this and then begins to work toward that goal I'll tell you who the successful people are as success is the school teacher who's teaching school because that's what she wanted to do the success is the woman who's a wife and mother because she wanted to become a wife and mother and is doing a good job of it the success is the man who runs the corner gas station because that's what he wanted to do the success is the successful salesman who wants to become a top-notch salesman and grow and build with his organization a success is anyone who is doing deliberately a predetermined job because that's what he decided to do deliberately but only one out of 20 does that that's why today there isn't really any competition unless we make it for ourselves instead of competing all we have to do is create now for 20 years I looked for the key which would determine what would happen to a human being was there a key I wanted to know which would make the future of promise that we could foretell to a large extent was there a key that would guarantee a person's becoming successful if he only knew about it and knew how to use it well there is such a key and I've found it have you ever wondered why so many men worked so hard and honestly without ever achieving anything in particular and others don't seem to work hard and yet seem to get everything they have the magic touch you've heard them say that about someone everything he touches turns to gold and have you ever noticed that a man who becomes successful tends to continue to become successful and on the other hand have you noticed how a man who is a failure tends to continue to fail it's because of goals some of us have them some don't people with goals succeed because they know where they're going now think of a ship leaving a harbor and think of it with the complete voyage mapped out and planned the captain and crew know exactly where it's going and how long it will take it has a definite goal 9999 times out of 10,000 it will get to where it started out to get now let's take another ship just like the first only let's not put a crew on it or a captain at the helm let's give it no aiming point no goal no destination we just start the engines and let it go I think you'll agree with me that if it gets out of the harbor at all it will either sink or wind up on some deserted beach a derelict it can't go anyplace because it has no destination and no guidance it's the same with a human being take the salesman for example there is no other person in the world today with the future of a good salesman selling is the world's highest-paid profession if we're good at it and if we know where we're going every company needs top-notch salesmen and they reward those men the sky is the limit for them but how many can you find someone once said the human race is fixed not to prevent the strong from winning but to prevent a weak from Lou the American economy today can be likened to a convoy in time of war the entire economy is slowed down to protect its weakest link just as the convoy had to go at the speed that would permit its slowest vessel to remain in formation that's why it's so easy to make a living today it takes no particular brains or talent to make a living and support a family today so we have a plateau of so-called security if that's what a person is looking for but we do have to decide how high above this plateau we want to aim for now let's get back to the strangest secret in the world the story that I wanted to tell you today why do men with goals succeed in life and men without them fail well let me tell you something which if you really understand it will alter your life immediately if you understand completely what I'm going to tell you from this moment on your life will never be the same again you'll suddenly find that good luck just seems to be attracted to you the things you want just seem to fall in line and from now on you won't have the problems the worries the knowing lump of anxiety that perhaps you've experienced before doubt fear well they'll be things of the past here's the key to success and the key to failure we become what we think about now let me say that again we become what we think about throughout all history the great wise men and teachers philosophers and prophets have disagreed with one another on many different things it is only on this one point that they are incomplete and unanimous agreement listen to what Marcus Aurelius the great Roman Emperor said he said a man's life is what his thoughts make of it Disraeli said this everything comes if a man will only wait I have brought myself by long meditation to the conviction of a human being with a settled purpose must accomplish it and that nothing can resist a will that will stake even existence for its fulfillment Ralph Waldo Emerson said this a man is what he thinks about all day long William James said the greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their by altering their attitudes of mind and he also said we need only in cold blood act as if the thing in question were real and it will become infallibly real by growing into such a connection with our life that it will become real it will become so knit with habit and emotion that our interest in it will be those which characterized belief he also said this if you only care enough for a result you will almost certainly attain it if you wish to be rich you will be rich if you wish to be learned you will be learning if you wish to be good you will be good only you must then really wish these things and wish them exclusively and not wish at the same time a hundred other incompatible things just as strongly in the Bible you read in mark 9:23 if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth dr. norman vincent peale said this this is one of the greatest laws in the universe fervently do i wish i had discovered it as a very young man it dawned upon me much later in life and i found it to be one of the greatest if not my greatest discovery outside of my relationship to God and the great law briefly and simply stated is that if you think in negative terms you'll get negative results if you think in positive terms you will achieve positive results that is the simple fact which is at the basis of an astonishing law of prosperity and success in three words believe and succeed William Shakespeare put it this way our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt George Bernard Shaw said people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are I don't believe in circumstances the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can't find them make them well it's pretty apparent isn't it and every person who discovered this for a while believed that he was the first one to work it out we become we think about now it stands to reason that a person who's thinking about a concrete and worthwhile gold is going to reach it because that's what he's thinking about and we become what we think about conversely the man who has no goal who doesn't know where he's going and whose thoughts must therefore be thoughts of confusion and anxiety and fear and worry becomes what he thinks about his life becomes one of frustration fear anxiety and worry and if he thinks about nothing he becomes nothing now how does it work why do we become what we think about well I'll tell you how it works as far as we know now to do this I want to tell you about a situation that parallels the human mind suppose a farmer has some land and it's good fertile land now the land gives the farmer a choice he may plant in that land whatever he chooses the land doesn't care it's up to the farmer to make the decision now remember we're comparing the human mind with the land because of the mind like the lamb doesn't care what you plant in it it will return what you planned but it doesn't care what you plant now let's say that the farmer has two seeds in his hand one is a seed of corn the other is nightshade a deadly poison he digs two little holes in the earth and he plants both seeds one corn the other nightshade he covers up the holes waters and takes care of the land and what will happen invariably the land will return what is planted as it's written in the Bible as you sow so shall you reap remember the land doesn't care it will return poison and just as wonderful abundance as it will corn so up come the two plants one corn one poison now the human mind is far more fertile far more incredible and mysterious than the land but it works the same way it doesn't care what we plant success/failure a concrete worthwhile goal or confusion misunderstanding fear anxiety and so on but what we plant it will return to us you see the human mind is the last great unexplored continent on the earth it contains riches beyond our wildest dreams it will return anything we want to plant now you might say but if that's true why don't people use their minds more well I think they've figured out an answer to that to our mind comes a standard equipment at birth it's free and things that are given to us for nothing we place little value on things that we pay money for we value the paradox is that exactly the reverse is true everything that's really worthwhile in life came to us free our mind our soul our body our hopes our dreams our ambitions our intelligence our love of family and children and friends all these priceless possessions are free but the things that cost us money are actually very cheap and can be replaced at any time a good man can be completely wiped out and make another fortune he can do that several times even if our home burns down we can rebuild it but the things we got for nothing we can never replace the human mind isn't used merely because we take it for granted familiarity breeds contempt it can do any kind of job we assign to it but generally speaking we use it for little jobs instead of big important ones universities have proved that most of us are operating on about 10 percent of our abilities decide now what is it you want plant your goal in your mind it's the most important decision you ever make in your entire life do you want to be an outstanding salesman a better worker at your particular job do you want to go places in your company in your community all you've got to do is plant that seed in your mind care for it work steadily toward your goal and it will become a reality it not only will there's no way that it cannot you see that is a law like the laws of Sir Isaac Newton the laws of gravity if you get on top of a building and jump off you'll always go down you'll never go up and it's the same with all the other laws of nature they always work they're inflexible think about your goal in a relaxed positive way picture yourself in your mind's eye as having already achieved this goal see yourself doing the things you will be doing when you've reached your goal ours has been called the phenobarbital age the age of ulcers and nervous breakdowns at a time when medical research has raised us to a new plateau of good health and longevity far too many of us worry ourselves into an early grave trying to cope with things in our own little personal ways without learning a few great laws that will take care of everything for us these things we bring on ourselves through our habitual way of thinking every one of us is the sum total of his own thoughts he is where he is because that exactly where he really wants to be whether he'll admit that or not each of us must live off the fruit of his thoughts in the future because what you think today and tomorrow next month the next year will mold your life and determine your future you're guided by your mind I remember one time I was driving through Arizona and I saw one of those giant earthmoving machines roaring along the road at about 35 miles an hour with what looked like 20 tons of dirt in it a tremendous incredible machine and there was a little man perched way up on top with the wheel in his hands guiding it and as I drove along I was struck by the similarity of that machine to the human mind just suppose you're sitting at the controls of such a vast source of energy are you going to sit back and fold your arms and let it run itself into a ditch or are you going to keep both hands firmly on the wheel and control and direct this power to a specific worthwhile purpose it's up to you you're in the driver's seat you see the very law that gives us success is a two-edged sword we must control our thinking the same rule that can lead a man to a life of success wealth happiness and all the things he's ever dreamed of for himself and his family that very same law can lead him into the gutter it's all in how he uses it for good or for bad this is the strangest secret in the world now why do I say it's strange and why do I call it a secret actually it isn't a secret at all it was first promulgated by some of the earliest wise man and it appears again and again throughout the Bible but very few people have learned it understand it that's why it's strange and why for some equally strange reason it virtually remains a secret I believe that you could go out and walk down the Main Street of your town and ask one man after another what the secret of success is you probably wouldn't one into one man in a month who could tell you now this information is enormous ly valuable to us if we really understand it and apply it it's valuable to us not only for our own lives but the lives of those around us our family employees associates and friends life should be an exciting adventure it should never be a bore a man should live fully be alive he should be glad to get out of bed in the morning he should be doing a job he likes to do because he does it well one time I heard Grove Patterson make a speech the editor-in-chief of the Toledo daily Blade and as he concluded his speech he said something that I've never forgotten he said something like this my years in the newspaper business have convinced me of several things among them that people are basically good and that we came from someplace and were going someplace so we should make our time here an exciting adventure the architect of the universe didn't build a stairway leading nowhere and the greatest teacher of all the carpenter from the plains of Galilee gave us the secret time and time again as she believed so shall it be done unto you  you  on side number one of this record I've explained the strangest secret in the world and how it works now on this side I want to explain how you can prove to yourself the enormous returns possible in your own life by putting this secret to a practical test I want you to make a test that will last 30 days now it isn't going to be easy if you'll give it a good try it will completely change your life for the better back in the 17th century Sir Isaac Newton the English mathematician and natural philosopher gave us some natural laws of physics which apply as much to human beings as they do to the movement of bodies in the universe now one of these laws is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction simply stated as it applies to you and me it means we can achieve nothing without paying the price the results of your 30-day experiment will be in direct proportion to the effort you put forth to be a doctor you must pay the price of long years of difficult study to be successful in selling and remember that each of us succeeds to the extent of his ability to sell selling our families on our ideas selling education in schools selling our children on the advantages of living the good and honest life selling our associates and employees on the importance of being exceptional people too of course the profession of selling itself but to be successful in selling our way to the good life we must be willing to pay the price now what is that price well it's many things first it's understanding emotionally as well as intellectually that we literally become what we think about that we must control our thoughts if we're to control our lives it's understanding fully that as you sow so shall you reap secondly it's cutting away all the fetters from the mind and permitting it to soar as it was divinely designed to do it's the realization that your limitations are self-imposed and that the opportunities for you today are enormous beyond belief it's rising above narrow-minded pettiness and Prejudice thirdly to use all your courage to force yourself to think positively on your own problem to set a definite and clearly defined goal for yourself to let your marvelous mind think about your goal from all possible angles to let your imagination speculate freely upon many different possible solutions to refuse to believe there are any circumstances sufficiently strong to defeat you in the accomplishment of your purpose to act promptly and decisively when your course is clear and to keep constantly aware of the fact that you are at this moment standing in the middle of your own acre of diamonds as Russell Conwell used to point out fourth save at least 10% of what you earn it's also remembering that no matter what your present job it has enormous possibilities if you're willing to pay the price now let's just go over the important points in the price each of us must pay to achieve the wonderful life that can be ours it is of course worth any price one you will become what you think about to remember the word imagination let your mind soar three courage concentrate on your goal every day for save 10% of what you earn and action ideas are worthless unless we act on them now I'll try to apply in the 30-day test I want you to make now keep in mind that you have nothing to lose by making this test and everything you could possibly want to gain there are two things that may be said of everyone each of us wants something and each of us is afraid of something I want you to write on a card what it is you want more than anything else it may be more money perhaps you'd like to double your income or make a specific amount of money it may be a beautiful home it may be success at your job it may be a particular position in life it could be a more harmonious family each of us wants something right down on your card specifically what it is that you want make sure it's a single goal and clearly defined you needn't show it to anyone but carry it with you so that you can look at it several times a day think about it in a cheerful relaxed positive way each morning when you get up and immediately you have something to work for something to get out of bed for something to live for look at it every chance you get during the day and just before going to bed at night as you look at it remember that you must become what you think about and since you're thinking about your goal you realize that soon it will be yours in fact it's yours really the moment you write it down and begin to think about it look at the abundance all around you as you go about your daily business you have as much right to this abundance as any other living creature it's yours for the asking now we come to the difficult part difficult because it means the formation of what is probably a brand new habit and new habits are not easily formed once formed however it'll follow you for the rest of your life stop thinking about what it is you fear each time a fearful or negative thought comes into your consciousness replace it with a mental picture of your positive and worthwhile goal there will come times when you will feel like giving up it's easier for a human being to think negatively than positively that's why only 5% is successful you must begin now to place yourself in that group for 30 days you must take control of your mind it will think only about what you permitted to think each day for this 30 day test do more than you have to do in addition to maintaining a cheerful positive outlook give of yourself more than you've ever done before do this knowing that your returns in life must be in direct proportion to what you give the moment you decide on the goal to work toward you're immediately a successful person you're then in that rare and successful category of people who know where they're going out of every hundred people you belong to the top five don't concern yourself too much with how you're going to achieve your goal leave that completely to a Power greater than yourself all you have to do is know where you're going the answers will come to you of their own accord remember these words from the Sermon on the Mount and remember them well keep them constantly before you this month of your test ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened it's as marvelous and as simple as that in fact it's so simple that in our seemingly complicated world it's difficult for an adult to understand that all he needs is a purpose and faith for 30 days do your best if you're a Salesman go at it as you've never done before and not in hectic fashion but with the calm cheerful assurance that time well spent we'll give you the abundance in return you deserve and want if you're a homemaker devote your 30 day test to complete giving of yourself without thinking about receiving anything in return and you'll be amazed at the difference it makes in your life no matter what your job do it as you've never done it before for 30 days and if you've kept your goal before you every day you'll wonder and marvel at this new light you found Dorothea brand outstanding editor and writer discovered it for herself and tells about it in her fine book wake up and live her entire philosophy is reduced to the words act as though it were impossible to fail she made her own test with sincerity and faith and her entire life was changed one of overwhelming success now you wait your test for 30 full days don't start your test until you've made up your mind to stick with it you see by being persistent you're demonstrating faith persistence is simply another word for faith if you didn't have faith you would never persist if you should fail during your first 30 days by that I mean suddenly find yourself overwhelmed by negative thoughts you've got to start over again from that point and go 30 more days  gradually your new habit will form until you find yourself one of that wonderful minority to whom virtually nothing is impossible don't forget the card it's vitally important as you begin this new way of living on one side of the card write your goal whatever it may be on the other side write the words we've quoted from the Sermon on the Mount ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you in your spare time during your test period read books that will help you inspirational books like the Bible dorothea brands wake up and live the magic of believing by clogged Bristol think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and other books that instruct and inspire nothing great was ever accomplished without inspiration see that during these crucial first 30 days your own inspiration is kept at a peak above all don't worry worry brings fear and fear is crippling the only thing that can cause you to worry during your test is trying to do it all yourself know that all you have to do is hold your goal before you everything else will take care of itself remember also to keep calm and cheerful calm and cheerful don't let petty things annoy or get you off course now the sense making this test is difficult some may say well why should I bother well look at the alternative no one wants to be a failure no one really wants to be a mediocre individual no one wants a life constantly filled with worry fear and frustration therefore remember that you must reap that which you sow if you sow negative thoughts your life will be filled with negative things if you sow positive thoughts your life will be cheerful successful and positive now gradually you will have a tendency to forget what you've heard on this record play it often keep reminding yourself of what you must do to form this new habit gather your whole family about and listen to what's been said here at regular intervals in all most men will tell you that they want to make money without understanding the law the only people who make money work in the mint the rest of us must earn money this is what causes those who keep looking for something for nothing or a free ride to fail in life the only way to earn money is by providing people with services or products which are needed and useful we exchange our product or service for the other man's money therefore the law is that our financial return will be in direct proportion to our service success is not the result of making money making money is the result of success and success is in direct proportion to our service most people have this law backwards they believe that you're successful if you earn a lot of money the truth is that you can only earn money after you're successful it's like the story of the man who sat in front of the stove and said to it give me heat and then I'll add the wood how many men and women do you know or do you suppose there are today who take the same attitude toward life there are millions we've got to put the fuel in before we can expect heat likewise we've got to be of service first before we can expect money don't concern yourself with the money be of service build work dream create do this and you'll find there's no limit to the prosperity and abundance that will come to you prosperity is founded upon a law of mutual exchange any person who contributes to prosperity must prosper in turn himself sometimes the return will not come from those you serve but it must come to you from someplace for that is the law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction as you go daily through your 30-day test period remember that your success will always be measured by the quality and quantity of service you render and money is a yardstick for measuring this service no man can get rich himself unless he enriches others there are no exceptions to a law you can drive down any Street in America and from your car estimate the service that's being rendered by the people living on that street had you ever thought of this yardstick before it's interesting some like ministers and priests and other devoted people measure their returns in the realm of the spiritual but again their returns are equal to their service once this law is fully understood any thinking person can tell his own fortune if he wants more he must be of more service to those from whom he receives his return if he wants less he has only to reduce this service this is the price you must pay for what you want if you believe you can enrich yourself by deluding others you can only end by deluding yourself just as surely as you breathe you'll get back what you put out don't ever make the mistake of thinking you can avert this it's impossible the prisons and the streets were the lonely walk are filled with people who tried to make new laws just for themselves we may avoid the laws of man but there are greater laws that cannot be broken an outstanding medical doctor recently pointed out six steps that will help you realize success 1 set yourself a definite goal to quit running yourself down 3 stop thinking of all the reasons why you cannot be successful and instead think of all the reasons why you can for trace your attitudes back through your childhood and try to discover where you first got the idea you couldn't be a success if that's the way you've been thinking 5 change the image you have of yourself by writing out a description of the person you would like to be and 6 act the part of the successful person you have decided to become the doctor who wrote those words is a noted West Coast psychiatrist David Herold Fink MD do what all the experts since the dawn of recorded history have told you you must do pay the price by becoming the person you want to become it's not nearly as difficult as living unsuccessfully make your 30-day test then repeat it then repeat it again each time it will become more a part of you until you'll wonder how you could ever have lived any other way live this new way and the floodgates of abundance will open and pour over you more riches than you may have dreamed existed money yes lots of it but what's more important you'll have peace you'll be in that wonderful minority who lead calm cheerful successful lives start today you have nothing to lose but you have a life to win", "YD2EZxI54p8": "I I welcome this opportunity to chat with everybody and thank you for taking time out of your evening and giving the old man your ear here is really what what is transpired you know if you look back when you bought a home you went to the bank and you filled out some paperwork and one of the pieces of paper that you signed was your mortgage and it was notarized and it was recorded with peat birth deeds as Register of Deeds or clerk of County Clerk or whatever okay and the other piece of paper that you set filled out and signed was a promise and let's say you borrowed $400,000 well you signed a piece of paper will you promise to pay that man across the table or his representative four hundred thousand dollars over a period of 30 years or 20 years or whatever the term was but you signed that piece of paper and it was not notarized but it was like signing a blank cheque but it was a promise of pay which made it a negotiable instrument now when you press when you gave sign that paper you thought that the bank was going to give you $400,000 that's what you thought well when you sign that piece of paper what did they give you they give you anything yet you just signed the document and that piece of paper became an asset for that Bank it was now an asset that they owned you no longer owned it yours was a promise to pay so that asset was now $400,000 of bears and here's what they did with it they didn't give you any money yet but they took that asset and they created a bond just like you would bail your nephew out of jail they created a bond and that bond went they took it to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve gave them approximately ten times the amount of your promise to pay now let's say you promised to pay with four hundred thousand the Federal Reserve create or gave them a credit of about four million bucks now how much money have they put up they have put up absolutely zero they leveraged leveraged and the technical word for it is monetized but they leveraged your promise to pay to create four million bucks and they still had your promise to pay they kept it they just created a bond they then took your promise to pay to another party and we'll call that party a wholesaler and that wholesaler took it to what we call an aggregator or trustee and it was then sold to a trust and 95 percent of the Trust's are in New York so with sold on Wall Street well where did the money come from for this note where did it come from well the trust filed before you even applied for that note the trust filed what we call an 8k filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we'll call it the Rosato trust and they told the Securities and Exchange Commission that they were going to sell investment certificates and they were what we call mortgage-backed securities or they were called CDOs collateralized collateralized debt obligations whatever fancy to and they called it that note was that was the security for these folks to induce certificate holders or investors let's just say the folks that are listening to this phone call let's say they represent the school teachers in their area so the school teachers pension plan invested ten million dollars each into this trust that was backed by your promise to pay so they were they were given let's say 6% return on their investment but you were paying maybe 7% so the trust was earning money okay now those certificates okay that were purchased by the investors okay that money went back to the bank that you signed that promise to pay with and that's where the funds came from for you to buy your house Wow Wow listen to this for a minute that piece of paper that was never notarized traveled all around the world gathering a lot a lot of money it created four million dollars for the bank and credit on your signature it also induced a lot of school teachers pension plans or firefighters pension plans to invest into that trust they got an investment certificate and the funds came backwards to the bank and the bank then threw the title company they provided the four hundred thousand dollars to purchase the house good deal very good deal for who for the bank they got four million in credits and did a nickel out now the trustee for this trust he is provided what we call a pooling and services agreement that's his management book as his rules that's what he has to follow to comply with the SEC rules so in a pooling and services agreement there's a clause in there that says if you failed to pay your mortgage they they entered into an insurance contract so if that mortgage wasn't paid the insurance company would pay it but the money wouldn't go to you it would go to the trust only we call that a credit default swap and the insurance company is listen to this a PI G now when you got in trouble and you know you lost your job or your overtime or for whatever reason you tried to contact the bank and you got the runaround you ended up talking to this person that person submit these papers oh we lost them submit them again and all that practicals with it but you were told we can't help you until you're 90 days late everybody's heard that well guess what happened on day 91 on day 91 the insurance policy that the trustee entered into with AIG triggered a payoff and the trust received the full amount of the note regardless of how much you paid on your mortgage they got the full amount of the note so the note was insurer for 400,000 to trust got 400,000 but here's a mystery here and I'll explain it as easy as I can the Federal Reserve allowed the trust to leverage that $400,000 note 30 times so they created 30 different levels now your four thousand dollar note is purchased by other lenders along we go now let's go back to the default the AIG paid off the note when it was 91 days late so at this point who has lost any money nobody except AIG or insurers like that Sol Smith Salomon Barnum Brothers and all that stuff now someone attempts to foreclose let's say the lender that you've got know from they're going to foreclose on you or the trust is going to foreclose on you or let's say it's Wells Fargo acting as trustee for Bear Stearns trust well they're trying to steal the house because nobody has any skin in the game they've all been paid commissions and there they've been very successful in stealing houses what happened here well I sat in the fort minor's courtroom many times and I watched folks average folks lose their house in five minutes because they didn't have an idea of what to do didn't know where to go for an answer and didn't have any money now in this foreclosure arena  call it a football field in this field of litigation the only players are the consumers who have enough money to pay an attorney and what is he doing he's delaying decline so that you maybe save a couple of months of rent or mortgage payments but at the end of the game end of the day when you pull the shade down journalize up he wins a dismissal without prejudice which means the bank that is foreclosing who doesn't have any skin in the game will come back again in a month and try to pork try to foreclose him murrs are technically is Mortgage Electronic Registration system  they were formed by the banks and the met banks became members and MERS at the closing table is named as the nominee lender they take they take possession of the mortgage electronically not the hard copy but electronically MERS their theory is and was that by they being the nominee lender and having possession of the mortgage electronically they believe that the note followed the mortgage and there are some judges who don't understand this who agreed with that however the US Supreme Court in 1872 said if the note and the mortgage are separated because one secures the other if they're separated they're both null and void and to simplify it if you were going to buy my car you're not going to give me the check until I give you the title the keys to the car are one thing but the title is another thing now MERS took possession of the mortgage but they could not take possession of the note because the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that they are not a lender with that being said your loan was bifurcated that's a legal word bifurcated right at the closing but you didn't know that now that means you're tied chain of title was broken so fast forwarding ahead we simply said and this workbook that I created and I'm the only layman that I know of and I've been told us that's ever been approved by the Florida Bar to teach attorneys about this subject as subsequent we've been approved by the Georgia bar the Wisconsin bars and Nevada bar and other states to follow so that's quite an accomplishment for a little white hair old man to be able to be certified to teach attorneys what you need is a securitisation audit which follows the paper trail from the time you closed until it enters into the trust and a Bloomberg financial report that pulls out all of the financial information about the trust when you have that information and it's accompanied with an affidavit sworn under the penalty of perjury you know evidence you now have admissible evidence to the court that the note was paid off when the insurance or credit default swap was triggered well if the note was paid off who is damaged who is damaged nobody the only logical people with a claim to that house only logical people would be the insurance company that paid out the claim but now here's it is the end of my story tonight and then now open it up for questions if you have your vehicle insured by let's say Geico and you total it the Geico will write you a check for the value of the vehicle but who owns the salvage rights think about that for a minute write your question down think about it the salvage rights are owned by Geico they then part it out sell it whatever so they can minimize their losses well in the foreclosure arena the insurance company is Geico and if they paid off the certificate holders then they would have a claim to the house logical except except they insured unsecured notes remember at the closing table MERS became the nominee lender it separated the note from the mortgage the US Supreme Court says that they're separated they're both null and void well Geico insured unsecured notes because the notes that were not accompanied by the mortgage or vice versa therefore they had no claim on the wreck or the house who now so it's actually the dog dripping or a versa double dipping and triple dependent absolutely and today Geico has a big-time lawsuit against Bank of America because Geico kinda guy called my god when you get my age you can invent Wars AIG has a major lawsuit against Bank of America because Bank of America defrauded them on the quality of the loans the loans were rated triple-a by sub Standard & Poor's or Moody's or whatever when in fact they slid into that pile of loans they slid the slid in some toxic lonesome some marginal loans and Geico ended up paying based on misrepresentation Wow what a harness nest you here's what you do and I did this with Regions Bank I walked into the bank and I said to the girl I want to talk to the president the bank has dirty diapers and they really smell while he's in conference I said there's no problem I'll just drop the diapers right here in less than 30 seconds he comes out of his office and he said I overheard the conversation what's the problem I see you've got dirty diapers there's fraud in this in these loans now what do you want to do you want to litigate or you want to negotiate as they called his legal department and I said here's the proof you people have already been paid what do you want to do and it stopped all the activity in court because you had proof and that's the value of the securitisation audit and the bloomberg financial report so if I were a real estate investor I would not rely on any modification because you're dealing with someone who doesn't own the note remember remember earlier in the conversation a lawyer here in Cape Coral and the real estate broker they were partners they paid the bank one hundred and fifty six thousand dollars and Randy I think you saw the article and the bank didn't hold it so if I'm an investor how the hell do I know who owns the owns the note so the only way I can find out who owns the note so I can sit across the table and cut a deal is to flush them out of the woodwork and how do you flush them out you sue them Wow this will make a lot of enthusiasm okay the ability to walk into the bank and say to the bat to the president of Bank you have dirty diapers do you want to litigate or you do you want to negotiate and they always would rather negotiate and then it's a question of how much money they will take based on today's value so if a home had a mortgage of 400,000 is worth two hundred thousand today banks are negotiating today's value now can the individual homeowner negotiate no no because of the banks of alleged pay me in the first place", "49FFwqAVxlg": "", "Z-2tlEkHdQc": "", "IRVdiHu1VCc": "Translator: Mirah AlFalasi Auditor: Mahmoud Aghiorly Dirty job crew and I'm called up To a small town in Colorado, called Craig. It is only a few dozen square miles away, it is in the Rocky Mountains. The work was on the question of a sheep farm. And my role in the show is for those of you who haven't seen it - it's rather simple. I am a beginner, and I work with people who don't actually have a job. My responsibilities are just keeping up And make a friendship account of what it's like to have these people, For a day in their life. We work for those who ask us for it - like sheep grazing. .. Great. We go to Greg and stay in a hotel I realize the next day that castration It will be an important part of this business so. Usually, I don't do any research at all. However, this is a sensitive topic, and I work for Discovery Channel, And we want to accurately depict everything we do, And we definitely want to do that with a lot of respect for the animals. Therefore, the Humane Society called the animal And I say \"Look, I\\'m going to castrate some lambs, Can you tell me the deal? \" And they said \"Yes, it\\'s simple and clear.\" It's a straightforward method - they mainly use the elastic band, like this one, but a little bit smaller. That's actually one about playing cards I got yesterday, And there was some kind of familiarity. And I said, \"Well, what exactly is the process?\" And they said: \"Tape it tightly to the tail. And then another tape is applied tightly to the scrotum. The blood flows slowly and slowly, After a week, the said members will be cut off. \" \"Great! I got it.\" Well, I'm going to call the SPCA to confirm this - they confirm that. I also called PETA just for fun and they don't like it, but they confirm that. Well, that's basically how we do it. On the second day she went out. And I was given a horse to go get lambs And we take them to the barn that we built, We are moving in the business of animal husbandry. Melanie is Albert's wife. Albert is the shepherd. Melanie picks up the lamb - with her hands - One hand on both legs is right, and likewise on the left. The lamb goes on to the mail, and opens it. OK. Great. Albert goes, and I follow Albert, and the crew around me. I always watch the process of doing it the first time before I try to do it. Be a trainee, you know, you do. Albert puts his hand in his pocket to pull, you know, to show the black rubber band But what came out was a knife instead. And I said this is not a rubber band, you know. He had pounced it and opened it in the way that the sun caught That was just coming from Rocky Mountain - was - It was awesome. In space in about two seconds, Albert was holding the knife Between the cartilage of the tail, next to the background of the tail, Very quickly the tail went and was in the bucket that caught it. In a second thumb and big index finger hardened well, He had a scrotum, holding it firmly in his fist, And pull it towards it, and then, Take the knife and put it on a tip. Now you think you know what will happen, Michael, you don't know? Okay. He grabs it, he puts it to the tip of his shoulder, Then he grabs the scrotum and pushes it up, Then his head drops to the top, ignoring my view, And what I hear is the sound of slurping, The noise that appears to have been snatched from a sticky wall is being extracted And I'm not even joking. Can we play the video? No, I'm joking-- we can't-- Laughter I think it is better to talk through pictures. So, I'm doing something I've never done anything about filming dirty jobs, ever. I say, \"Time out. Stop.\" You guys know the show, and we use the first shot, and we don't use the second shot. No writing, no programming, no nonsense. We do not fool around, do not train, We shoot and succeed in photography! I told him: \"Stop this madness. I mean, you know - Laughter This is crazy. We cannot do this. And Albert said, \"Why?\" And I said, \"I don\\'t know what just happened, But there are members of this bucket, and this is not the way we should do it. \" And he said, \"Well, that\\'s how we do it.\" And I said, \"Why do you do it this way?\" Please let me explain before, I said, \"I want to do it the right way, with rubber.\" He says, \"Like the Humane Society?\" And I said, \"Yes, like the Humane Society. Let's do something that doesn't make pregnancy bleed - We are on five continents, my friend. Today we appear twice on Discovery Channel - we cannot do this. \" And he says, \"Okay.\" He goes to the box and pulls a bag of little rubber bands. Melanie picks up another load, puts it on the table, The rubber band will be on the tail, and the second strap will be on the scrotum. The lamb falls on the ground, and the pregnancy takes two steps, falls, Wake up, shake a little, He takes other steps, and falls again. I said, and this is not a good sign for this pregnancy at all. He wakes up, walks to the corner and trembles It falls from fatigue. And I look at pregnancy and say, \"Albert, for how long? When will he wake up?\" When will he wake up? \" And he said, \"In a day.\" I said, \"One day! How long will it take to happen?\" \"In a week.\" Meanwhile, the pregnancy had to do the little procedure He, you know, is jumping, the bleeding has stopped. He bites the grass, dances with joy. It flew away How wrong I was, in that second. And I remembered how wrong I was, quite often. Laughter I mentioned in particular that what is ridiculous is me on that day Because I had to do what Albert did And there are like 100 of these lambs in the barn, And suddenly everything started to sound like German porn, And I am amazed Melanie picks up the load, You put it on the table, and you open it. Albert D gave me the knife. Enter and the tail comes out. And I enter again, and grab the scrotum, he starts glimpsing me Albert instructs, \"Push it up.\" I do. \"I pay more for that.\" I do. Members are starting to appear and they look like thumbs, coming towards you. He says, \"Bite him. Just bite it. \" I heard it, and heard all the words. Laughter Like, how-- how did you get here? How do you-- you know-- I mean-- How did you get here? Laughter It's just-- it's one of those moments when the brain explodes on its own Suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rocky Mountains, All I can think of is Aristotle's definition of tragedy. As you know, Aristotle says tragedy The moment the hero comes face to face with his own identity. Laughter And I said, \"What is this compound analogy? I don\\'t like what I\\'m thinking about right now. \" And I can't get this thought out of my head, And I can't forget the scene and take it out of my sight, And I did what I had to do. I went and took them. I took them like this, And I grabbed my face again. And I'm standing there The testes are on my chin Laughter And now I can't get it - I can't shake the metaphor. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still poetic in Aristotle, I was thinking - suddenly, two phrases come crashing into my head I have not heard these phrases since I was studying with my classical teacher and he was digging them in my head. They are anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis and peripeteia. It is a word of Greek anagnorisis Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge anagnorisis What our network does, Are dirty jobs. I even neck my neck I live in anagnorises every single day. Great. The other word is, peripeteia And this is a moment in the big tragedies, you know - Euripides and Sophocles - The moment that Oedipus was his moment, Where he suddenly realized that chick He slept with the children with his mother. OK. This is peripety And peripeteia. And this analogy in my head - Anagnorisis and peripetia got my chin up. Laughter I have to tell you, this device is great. When you begin to search for Peripetia You find it everywhere. I mean, Bruce Willis in \"Sixth Sense,\" right? The movie goes on all the way to help the little boy who sees dead people And then Boom --- oh, I'm dead - peripetia. You know? He will shock the audience if he knows him the right way. New to Matrix, you know? Oh, I live on a computer program - and that's weird. These discoveries lead to sudden realization. And they had more than 200 dirty jobs, and they were with me the whole time, But these - and these discoveries took me away and I was not ready for them. And as I stood there, I look happily at the pregnancy I just desecrated-- But it looked okay. Looking at the little poor thing that you did that right, But I was shocked If I am wrong about that Whether I'm mistaken often, literally, What other misconceptions will I be able to comment on? Now look, I'm not a scientist in social anthropology But I have a friend who works in this field. And I'm talking to him. Laughter He says, \"Mike. See I don't know if your brain is interested in this type of thing or not, Do you realize I have filmed scenes in every country? I used to work in mining, I worked in fishing, She has worked steel and has worked in all major industries. You stand side by side with these guys We have that politicians have been unable to do even once every four years, right? \" I can still see Hillary doing the rye shots Dodging down her chin, with steel workers. I mean, these are the people that I work with every day. And if you have something to say about their ideas, and collectively, It may be time to think about it. Because, group, you know, four years. You know, that in my head, the members are on my chin, And thoughts revolve After filming, the dirty jobs didn't change, In terms of supply, But it has changed for me, personally. And now, when I talk about the show, And I'm no longer just a novel that I've heard 190 times. But I also start to talk about some other things that I misunderstood, And some other concepts from work That you just did on a sacred assumption, And no longer. People with dirty tasks are happier than you think. As a group, they are the happiest people I know. And I don\\'t want to start minimizing, \"Look for the union label,\" And all crap happy worker. I tell you that these people whose work is balanced you cannot imagine. Roadkill pickers-uppers whistle while they work, I swear to God, I worked with them. They've got this kind of amazing symmetry for their lives. And I see that again and again. So I started to wonder what would happen If we challenge some in these cows. Follow your passion - We have been talking about it here for the past 36 hours. Follow your passion - what could possibly be wrong with that? Probably the worst advice I ever got. Laughter You know, follow and fulfill your dreams, don't you? I mean, that's all I heard when they grew up. I didn't know what to do with my life, But I was told if you follow your passion, it will work. And I can give you 30 examples, right now-- Bob Combs, the pig breeder in Las Vegas That collects leftovers from casinos And give it to the pigs. Why? Because there is so much protein in things that we don't eat And pigs grow twice as fast as normal, He is a rich pig breeder, And it's good for the environment, He spends his days doing incredible services, It smells bad, but the Lord keeps it safe. It is a great livelihood. Ask him, \"Were you following your passion here?\" I will laugh at you. The man deserves - he got a roughly $ 60 million offer for his farm The offer was rejected .. It was outside Las Vegas He did not follow his affection. Stop .. and watch the show owners come out in front of it Then complete his path on the opposite path I hear this story over and over again. Furend, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, died. Who woke up one day and realized that it was his cows Deserves more than her milk, If it can be used to make these pots of biodegradable flowers Now he sold it to Wal-Mart. Follow his passion - men - come on. I started to look with a look of passion, And I began to see competence versus potency, As Tim talked about earlier, this is the big difference. I started to look at teamwork and design, And basically all these trivialities are called success Who hang out with art of Northsea administration around the world right now. those things -- Suddenly it turned upside down. Safety - Safety first It is that I will return to you, you know, the Safety and Health and Beta, and the Humane Society. What if the Safety and Health Organization is wrong? I mean, this is a novelty, what I'm about to say, But what if safety really came in third place, not first? Is this appropriate? Laughter No, I mean really. What I mean by saying is that my safety has more value about these crazy jobs As much as the people I work with, But they are the ones who are doing it the right way, They are not there to talk about safety first And they know that other things come first-- The completion of the project comes first, Do and complete the project. And I will not forget, in the Bering Sea, on a crab boat With bloody hunting players, which I work in season one. We are about 100 kilometers off the coast of Russia And 50 feet for the seas, big waves, and green water coming into the wheelhouse, right? This is one of the greatest dangerous environments I've ever seen, I came back with the man, and I flew these fish So, when I'm 40 feet above deck, Which is like looking at the top of the shoe, You know, he does that in the ocean. Seriously not mentioned. I'm going down, I'm going to the wheelhouse And I say, with a degree of skepticism, Captain, Safety and Health Organization. And he says, \"Safety and Health? - The Ocean.\" He points out there Laughter But at that moment, what he said could not be repeated in the lower part of 48. It cannot be repeated in that factory or any construction site. But he looked at me, and he said \"Japanese - He's my age, by the way, calling me my son, and I like that-- As he says, \"Son, I\\'m the captain of a fishing boat. My responsibility is to bring you home while you are alive. It is my responsibility to return to the home with more wealth. \" Laughter You want to get home alive, it's up to you. For the rest of that day, safety comes first. I like -- The idea that we create this lie - This is a feeling of contentment When we talk about someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility And being our responsibility, and vice versa. However, in a lot of things. I can talk at length about the few differences we made On ourselves and an endless list of ways that we mistakenly understood But what is the purpose of all this Have a theory, and I will share with you now In the remaining thirty minutes and thirty seconds. And this is what happens - I have declared war on business, As a community, for all of us. It is a civil war. It is the cold war. Really. We haven't started doing that We have not wrapped our drinkers in the Machiavellian way, But we did. This war was waged on at least four fronts, And definitely in Hollywood. The way we portray the working people on TV, It's funny. If there is a plumber .. he weighs 300 pounds .. and he talks a lot of bad words .. to admit this We see it all the time. This is what plumbers look like, isn't it? We turn them into heroes, or we take them to the platform This is what TV does. We are trying hard that dirty jobs are not, This is the first reason I am doing this and I am not cheating. This war was waged on Madison Street. I mean, a lot of commercials that come from there - On the path to a message, what is really said? Your life would be better if you had worked a little less If you don't have a job to do, if you can go home earlier, If you retired early, that's all. That's all there is, over and over, over and over again. Washington - I can't even begin to talk about deals and policies affecting this place Reality of the bottom line of available jobs Because I really don't know. And I recently learned on this front in war. And this, my group, Silicon Valley I mean how many people have an iPhone? How many people have BlackBerry? We are connected to these devices I will never protest This gives a bad impression of the technology revolution. Wailing Jebed, not suitable for this audience Laughter I will not suggest renewal and imitation Without a waste of time. Nobody celebrates fake things They also celebrate the dirty job crew because they know how it is done. And people who use the iPhone have in common, Common systems, over and over again. All of it - and that is what makes this device both Genius innovation So, we have these new tools, you know. We have tools today that do not look like a scoop and a pick. They look like the things we run around with. So the collective effect of all Therefore, this marginalization went to many and many job opportunities. And I realized, perhaps too late in this game - And I hope it isn't, because I don't know if I can do more than 200 of these things But we will do as much as possible. And for me, the most important thing is to realize the importance of things Face situations face to face And in fact I got things wrong, It is not just about members. I got it wrong most of the way So, we think-- who we are, I mean I - The thing that I'm doing is talking about a PR campaign for work, Manual work, and skilled labor. Someone should be there To talk about forgotten benefits I mean grandfather's property. Much of the property we grew up with But you know we lost some of it. Barak wants to create two and a half million jobs. Infrastructure is a huge deal structure. This war on work, which I believe exists, has losses Like other wars. First the infrastructure Second, low rates of enrollment in commercial schools. Every year the number of electricians decreases, Carpenters, plumbers, Welders, and pipeline mechanics, And steam. The infrastructure jobs that everyone talks about creating are a phrase About these people. Who have been decreasing, over and over again. Meanwhile, we got two trillion dollars, at a minimum, According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, We need to spend in order to invent the infrastructure Which is currently ranked fourth. So, if I run anything, not like that, I would simply say that the jobs we wish to accomplish Which we hope to create It will not last if it is not the jobs that people want. I know the goal of this conference Is to celebrate the things near and dear to us, But I also know that the clean and dirty ones are not opposite. They are two sides of the same coin. Just like innovation and imitation, And like risk and responsibility, And like peripetia and anagnorisis Like the poor sheep, which I hope will not be shivering anymore, And like my past time. It was great talking to you And back to work, please? clap", "1XDpa2HLXV0": "Translator: Lan (Theresa) Peng Proofreader: Sunny \u00e9\u203a\u00a8 \u00e5\u00bf\u0192 Li Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: \"If a person wants to be born sometime That will not be a revolutionary period; New and old things are juxtaposed, Being compared When everyone's energy is searched by fear and hope; When glorious old days can be Compensated by the rich possibilities of the new era, This era, like all times, is a very good era. If we know what to do. It reminds me of something that happened to me 17 years ago. I live in Sydney, Australia and I just started a new job. I was invited to a national sales conference, Because I was the general manager of operations, Then I found out that the National Sales Conference happened to be It's when my wife is about to have children. So, I am very worried. I went home and told her, \"Look, the first child will never be born on time. (laughter) So I left for one night and I'm going to Cairns, Australia. I will be there one night-I have a speech- Then I will come back and everything will be fine, Anyway, as the doctor told us, \"You won\\'t have children in the next two weeks.\" I went there and I bargained for the bonus plan for that year, So, I talked to my new boss. He is a Swiss gentleman named Rodo. Rodo has a very, very heavy Swiss accent, And he often smokes. We start this difficult negotiation, During the negotiation process, At 11:45 that night, when we were sitting in the bar, My phone is ringing. Is my wife. . . I said, \"Is everything OK?\" She said, \"My amniotic fluid has broken.\" I thought, \"Oh, no.\" I'm in Keynes. I can't in such a short time Head south to Sydney, Because doctors say that usually from amniotic fluid to child birth, It usually takes four hours. So, I went to my boss and I knew he had a plane- I said, \"Is there any way to help me fly to Sydney tonight, Because my wife is about to have a baby. \" While smoking, he said, (Inhale) \"Give me ten minutes.\" (laughter) \"I will prepare a flight plan and then we will leave.\" So I ran back to my room and took everything on the bed, Throw into a suitcase- I remember there was a remote control, It was actually thrown into the suitcase- I ran downstairs and stood at the elevator waiting for him, After about 20 minutes, He finally walked out of the elevator slowly, looked at me, and said, \"Can you believe it? I couldn\\'t find the key to the plane just now.\" (laughter) So we ran, We got into a taxi and went to the airport. I saw the airport lights- Realize this is Douglas Airport- The plane actually has buttons to listen to the radio. So you press the button and the light comes on, he said, \"I need you to check the wings, I need you to check the oil, Check the condensation system \"and I said, \"I don\\'t know anything about these. Are you kidding me?\" So I was really scared. People who work with me know when I'm scared or stressed, My heart rate really drops, my blood pressure really drops, My reaction was just the opposite. In all my companies, my management team knows this, So when things get really tricky and bad, it causes me to react in the opposite way, They usually buy me a pillow, Because I will fall asleep. (laughter) So we got into the plane, took off, and then I started thinking, \"I must catch up with the child, I must catch up with the child,\" Then I fell asleep completely. (laughter) And I'm in the cockpit, I'm the first officer! We are on the sky. Suddenly, our plane started bouncing. I woke up, I looked at the dashboard, It was always on before, Now it's completely blank. He said to me, \"Robert, can you see the coastline?\" I said, \"I don\\'t see it, the clouds are too thick.\" He said-he was talking, there was a lot of noise around, it was a turboprop He said, \"Are you sure you don\\'t see the coastline?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" Then he said, \"To add some drama ... (laughter) None of our navigation and gauges worked. Can you see the coastline? \" (laughter) So, they actually had to close Sydney International Airport to find us. We have departed for New Zealand- That's why he asked the coastline. Our oil is only enough to go to Sydney, And now I really, \"I must see my daughter born,\" And now what I am thinking is \"I must do it.\" (laughter) Finally, we arrived in Sydney and we landed the plane. I flew to the hospital. We landed at 3:07 and took 30 minutes to go to Berkhansan Hospital. I rush as fast as I can. I got there, I hurried through the door of the delivery room, When I first entered the room where my wife was giving birth to our daughter, The doctor and nurse said, \"He\\'s here!\" I saw my daughter's head, just came out, A minute later, she was born. (applause) Now, of course, I hold her, at that moment, It was the moment when I felt the most awe in my whole life. I remember thinking, \"This is a wonderful moment.\" However, my thoughts are occupied by fear and hope. Will I be a good father? Those with children know this feeling. Am I capable of this responsibility? Will she be the daughter I long for? Will I be the father she longs to be? Often, we are caught by fear. Alexander the Great once said, \"Human beings are not immortal. Every moment not ruled by fear makes humanity immortal. \" Human immortality does not live forever because this desire comes from fear! Every moment not ruled by fear makes humanity immortal. \" When you overcome your own fear, your thoughts last forever. But how do you do it? Because we all start thinking from the perspective of lack. Others consider it from a rich perspective. Harvard Business School, Ask them when they graduate, \"When you graduate, what do you want more, in terms of salary?\" In the first case, all currencies are the same. You earn 160,000 after graduation. The average number of other students during the same period was 150,000. In the second case, you make 200,000, The other students earned an average of 220,000. What do you think they would choose? 87% will choose the first one! Now, you think these are the smartest kids in the world. (laughter) right? You will think they are smart They went to Harvard, they learned a lot about money, However, they chose the one that made less money. Because they are more concerned with \"there are no They pay more attention to \"you win and I lose\", and the opposite remains true. In fact, richness changes everything. Richness comes from self-confidence; Poverty comes from fear. Break your own way of thinking Will change your life and change your world. Not all the moments in our lives are what we deserve. We get what we expect. The researchers went to the first grade class, they tested all the students, Do an IQ test. In that IQ test, they asked everyone- They told the teacher, \"You can\\'t talk about it with students or parents. We will observe you for a year, You have to sign a non-disclosure agreement, About who got the highest score. \" 30 students took the test, Five have reached genius level: an IQ score above 140. 5 students. So during the second school year, they monitored the class. They monitored the teacher. At the end of the year, they came back to test all the students, See if there are any changes or differences in the results. Who do you think got the highest score? 5 gifted students! No fuss. It's just that it's not the real situation and purpose of the research. The truth is that they lied to that teacher. None of the students were tested for talent a year ago. She's at the subconscious level-expectations for those 5 students, She did obey the rules- The five students got the highest score. Two ways to overcome fear- And this is from my own personal life experience, So this is Robert's philosophy. One is: Thanksgiving. I found that at the same time, it was impossible to be afraid and grateful. If I let my thoughts stop for a while and feel grateful. Even in despair and trouble, It makes my life different. I personally find that the next way to overcome fear, Is to make a decision intentionally. Everything that happened to you, Can be the best thing, Or the worst thing. It depends on your own opinion. About 18 months ago, I was played hard 2 years before that, I left a very good job, I left because I was hired by Huaping Investment, That's a big private equity fund company, Become CEO of Bausch & Lomb Surgery. The intention was to spin off the business, Make it an independent business and try to make a profit from it. It has always been a bad business; The performance at that time was not good at all. During the next year, we changed our business metrics. It worked. We did very well. After a year and a half, I am ready. \"Really good ... The company works very well, Employees are also very willing to recommend, All our customers have very high \"willing to recommend\" scores. it\\'s time. \\'\" Because we started doing so well, expecting very good growth, The parent company decided that they did not want to spin off the business, They can sell the entire company to another party, And get greater value. My hopes are shattered, and I am going to collapse. That night, I flew home from New York and was very broken; I actually vomited on the plane. The next morning, I woke up, I remember I was thinking, \"Today may be the worst day of my life, or it may be the best day. That depends on me. \" I decided it should be the best day. Later that day, I had an idea, Create a medical company that is not involved in all areas of healthcare. The first company that didn't take a penny from the government. I didn't realize how ambitious this was an idea. A year and a half later, it was Friday, just like yesterday. I visited the Bausch & Lomb building. Bausch & Lomb was acquired by Valeant for $ 9 billion. I toured the Bausch & Lomb building and made a bet on it- Within 18 months. What can your mind do in 18 months? What if you don't have any fear? Nelson Mandela spent 29 years in prison as a political prisoner, He did nothing wrong, but only expressed his views and philosophical ideas. Every day, when they let him rock, He recalled a poem by William Ernest Henry. \"The night droops over me, and the poles are like a dark cellar I thank the unknown God for giving me an undefeated heart. Even if the environment is dangerous and critical, I will not shrink back or cry, Under the threat of timing, I don't give in. Beyond such grief and indignation, the haze of terror is approaching, I will be fearless after all. Even though the passageway is extremely narrow, despite the endless severe punishment, I am the master of my destiny, I am the commander of my soul \" Each of us is the master of our own destiny. We can use gratitude instead of fear. We can overcome fear with firm choices. Our perception drives reality. In life, you ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always get what you deserve, But you can almost always get what you expect. 17 years ago, the moment I held my daughter, I decided, Every day, I have to tell her that I love her. She will become a beautiful woman. She will be the best daughter I can imagine. Her name is Madeleine. And she would be smart, Able, courteous, kind, practical. She really became such a person. Life has been unfolding to us. We can decide how to treat it. Let us all be sure that we are the masters of our destiny, Is the commander of our own soul. Thank you. (applause)", "pul9r0jfbug": "The universe is a strange place by its very nature. Mysterious questions abound over dark matter, dark energy, how it all came to be and so on. But at the same time, as our astronomical instrumentation has improved, in modern times we have been able to study the universe in unprecedented detail. As that process has unfolded, the universe has rewarded us with both understanding, but also new mysteries, many of which have not been solved. In the course of making this channel, I\u2019ve run across and covered many such astronomical mysteries, some of them now solved, some of them not. But there has always been a core group that offer possibilities so weird, that they continue to baffle scientists to this day. So here are 10 Unsettling Astronomical Incidents and Phenomena. Number 10 The Nature of Pulsars When pulsars were first discovered in the 1960\u2019s the possibility that they were alien beacons had to be seriously considered after it was shown that they were not a product of earth interference. They were, after all, highly unnatural looking pulses of electromagnetic radiation that repeated with such regularity that some of them rivaled the accuracy of atomic clocks. In the years since, we\u2019ve learned that they are just an unusual case of nature emitting a regular signal by way of a rapidly rotating neutron star. This would seemingly lay the idea of alien involvement with pulsars to rest. Except, it actually doesn\u2019t. In 2017, Clement Vidal authored a paper that reopened the question of an alien technological origin for pulars, or at least a certain class of them that could have been natural objects tweaked by aliens for communications. He pointed out that there were five reasons that aliens were originally taken off the table as an explanation. The first was the truly titanic amounts of energy involved, it seemed unlikely to some that a civilization would use that kind of energy. Trouble is, we\u2019ve never seen an alien civilization and really have no idea what they would be capable of energy wise, and we do still talk about galaxy spanning Kardashev type III civilizations that would command far more energy than a pulsar. The other four reasons are equally problematic. One was that they are not unique. In other words, how likely would it be that two seperate civilizations would broadcast the same way at similar frequencies. Well, our earth civilizations do that, and SETI does spend a lot of time looking for aliens at the frequency 1420 Mhz because there are inherent scientific advantages to do so that alien scientists would also know about. Perhaps that could be the case with pulsars. Another reason was that pulsars generally do not emanate from planetary systems, but who says aliens have to stick to a planet? Also, they are not narrowband, kicking out broadband transmissions wastes energy and technology generally sticks to narrowband as a result. But if pulsars started out as natural objects, that are being tweaked for communications by exocivilizations, then broadband may just be a natural leftover artifact. But the fifth argument is the most solid. We have perfectly good natural explanations for pulsars that fit the bill. There really isn\u2019t a reason or need to evoke aliens when something appears explained and natural. But that doesn\u2019t eliminate the pesky possibility that pulsars could be tweaked by an exocivilization as a natural carrier for communications and that, maybe, we should look for that, especially in light that some of them are extremely accurate in their pulses, to the point that they could be used for something like a navigational beacon. That near absolute regularity present in some pulsars does still look a bit odd, decades after they were first detected. Number 9 Fast Radio Bursts This particular phenomenon is a relatively new one, having only been discovered in 2007. They come as a very quick bursts of radio waves that arrive in such a way that scientists know that while extremely powerful, they must come from very small sources that are very likely outside our galaxy, limiting what could be causing them. Further limiting what they might be is that at least one has been seen to repeat, seemingly ruling out any sort of cataclysmic event, such as a black hole merger. Most hypotheses currently on the table involve neutron stars or magnetars in some sort of odd situation, but it\u2019s also hypothetically possible that they could be of alien origin. In 2017, Manasvi Lingham and Abraham Loeb released a paper, link below, explaining that it\u2019s possible that the origin of at least some of them could be leakage from alien light sails, because the frequencies at which FRBs are detected happen to also be optimum frequencies for use with light sails. More, given that the FRBs have been shown to originate from very small sources, they point out that the emitter for a light sail would need to be about twice the diameter of Earth, well within the constraints on what could be producing FRBs. Number 8 The Dyson Sphere Candidates Sometimes ideas within the realm of futurism can be so speculative that, if realized, are probably going to prove impractical. One such concept is the Dyson Sphere, though it should more accurately be called a Stapledon Sphere, after the sci fi author that envisioned them in the 1930\u2019s, as opposed to Dyson\u2019s actual vision of a swarm of energy collectors. To actually encase a star within a solid shell would be a megastructure undertaking of truly titanic proportions that would involve things like completely disassembling planets for raw materials. And, it\u2019s not entirely clear how such a thing would be engineered, constructed and maintained. Surprisingly however, out of all the hypothetical alien megastructures that we have yet envisioned, the Dyson Sphere remains the only one for which we have detected candidates, though they probably aren\u2019t very good ones and are likely really due to natural phenomena. The detections stem from a search of infrared data from the IRAS satellite done by scientists at FermiLab. The idea is that Dyson Spheres absorbing energy from their star would re-emit that energy in the infrared in a specific, detectable way. They found 17 candidates that fit, though they were very ambiguous and probably have natural explanations, though efforts to figure out what they are are ongoing, and another project to search for them using the GAIA spacecraft has already yielded a further two eyebrow raisers, TYC 7169-1532-1 and TYC 6111-1162-1 though again they are really ambiguous. Nothing definitive, but in coming years if civilizations do indeed encase their stars in Dyson Spheres, it seems likely we\u2019ll spot it. Number 7 The Phantom Planet Unlike most of the phenomena on this list, this one could well be explained within the next few years, as several groups of scientists are actively looking for it. The motion of objects in the outer solar system is peculiar, as though they were disturbed by a large object in the outer solar system. In fact, yet another object showing orbital peculiarities consistent with this was found recently, bolstering the case that another planet exists in this solar system much further out than the orbit of Neptune. One possibility is that it\u2019s the solar system\u2019s missing super earth. Our star system is unusual because we lack a super earth, seemingly one of the more common types of planets in the Milky Way. This hypothetical planet may have formed closer into the solar system, but might have been pushed out early in the solar system\u2019s history. Another possibility is that it may not be from this solar system at all, and may be a captured object the sun acquired at some point in its history, in which case it would truly be an alien interloper in our star system, and would offer a chance at studying an actual former exoplanet that formed somewhere else. While it\u2019s not universally accepted that Planet 9 must be out there, there is also an arguement that the data is skewed and it may not exist at all, whatever the case, as hints of this phantom planet\u2019s existence continue to surface, it seems very possible that within a few years we may well have another known planet to explore. Number 6 TYC 8241 2652 This entry is truly bizarre because not only is there no ready explanation for it having happened, but also no ready explanation for how fast it happened. In 1983 the star TYC 8241 2652 was observed in the infra-red to have a debris disk. That in itself is nothing unusual, dust disks are a normal part of planetary formation, and indeed earth itself formed from one. And over time, a very long time in geologic terms, these disks tend to clear out as stable planetary systems develop. When TYC 8241 2652 was observed in 2010, the dust disk had completely disappeared, not in millions of years, but in the time since a previous observation in 2008. Whatever caused the dust\u2019s disappearance did it under two years. Numerous natural explanations were suggested for just how that could happen, only to fall flat and the cause for the disappearance remains a mystery, and has been seen in no other star system with debris disks since. Number 5 234 Detections of Something Strange Occasionally, a scientific paper will come out that\u2019s seemingly worthy of attention and then instantly go into obscurity. That\u2019s essentially what happened with a paper by Ermanno Borra and E. Trottier in 2016. It related to an earlier paper by Borra where he predicted that certain types of pulses could be produced by current technology and be detected a thousand light years away, and vice versa. Borra then searched existing data for anything that might look like those kinds of signals. He found 234 of them. Now, the media at the time sensationalized the story and in some cases badly reported it as though aliens had been found. This was not the case, and the scientists themselves made no claims that this was an actual detection of alien civilizations, merely that that was a possibility and that further follow-up work should be done. And that\u2019s where it sits today, but one thing still stands out. Nearly all of the detections where coming from stars of spectral types believed to be suitable for life. 1220-91-1 Number 4 The Wow! Signal This bizarre signal in some ways gets even more bizarre as time goes on simply because an alien origin for it cannot be ruled out, even though the signal was detected over four decades ago. In 1977 (check) astronomer Jerry Ehman using the Big Ear radio telescope at the Ohio State University picked up a signal. This signal was noteworthy for several reasons. The first is that it was very close to 1420 Megahertz, which is the frequency at which hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, emits radio waves. This frequency is of note to SETI scientists, in fact it\u2019s set aside and not broadcasted on specifically for this reason, because any alien civilization that possesses science and radio transmitters would know of this frequency. As a result, it might be a universal frequency to broadcast a contact signal. The second is that the Wow! Signal was strong. Very strong, which is why Dr. Ehman famously wrote wow on the printout. The third strange thing about this signal is that it was narrowband, which is in itself very odd. Nature tends to emit radio signals broadband, whereas technology tends towards narrowband. Another odd aspect of Wow is the fact that it was a very brief signal, it was there and then it was not. That seems counterintuitive for a contact signal, and it\u2019s never been picked up since, despite plenty of attempts to do so. Perhaps the strangest aspect of Wow though is that it keeps defying explanation. It\u2019s never been shown to have been earth interference, or a glitch in the equipment that picked it up. To this day, potential explanations continue to be put on the table, only to be shot down. This happened most recently with the hypothesis that Wow! might have been due to emissions originating from comets, and this was widely reported in the press as a case closed explanation. What they didn\u2019t report as widely is that the comet hypothesis was shot down by the scientific community very quickly. If comets emitted that strongly at the hydrogen line, radio astronomers would have noticed that by now and it should be easily observable. It\u2019s not. So, to this day, the Wow signal remains unexplained. Number 3 Strange Signals While the Wow! Signal is the most famous of the unexplained odd radio signals SETI astronomers have picked up, it is not unique. Other examples include a signal picked up just once, and did not repeat, from the direction of the star TYC 1220-91-1. What\u2019s notable about this signal is that it appeared to originate from a nearby star that\u2019s very similar to our sun, and potentially habitable. It was also at a magic frequency mathematically related to the 1420 megahertz hydrogen line. It was also narrowband, and was observed for a full ten seconds. But most noteworthy was that the signal was so strong, about ten times stronger than Wow!. But, since the signal didn\u2019t repeat and couldn\u2019t be verified, it can\u2019t ever be determined if it was simply earth interference. Other unverifiable signals include a 2015 signal from the star HD 164595, another very sun-like star, but this time with a verified planet in orbit around it. But it never repeated, and it happened to be in a military band, and it seems likely that there are satellites downlinking from orbit that scientists may not be aware of. And then there was the signal SHGb02+14a, which was weird even for a signal plausibly of alien origin. Firstly, unlike most, this signal repeated, having been initially observed three different times. And, it was at the 1420 Megahertz frequency, initially. But then it would drift. More, there didn\u2019t seem to be any corresponding star system to where the signal was coming from. And it was very weak, and if it originated on a planet, that planet would have to have been rotating 40 times faster than earth. Number 2 KIC 8462852 Tabby\u2019s Star In 2015 a star was found in the massive amount of data collected by the Kepler spacecraft that was behaving like no other star previously seen. It would experience dips in brightness of up to 22 percent suggesting that something extremely massive was passing in front of the star. Initially, it was uncertain as to what this could be. A cloud of dust wasn\u2019t a good fit because star systems that have dust discs tend to emit infrared radiation brightly. No such radiation was found at KIC 8462852. The star\u2019s main investigator, Dr. Tabetha Boyajian, suggested that it could be cold comets blocking the light. But on further investigation, it was found that the number of comets needed to produce the effect would have been implausible, hundreds of thousands of them. More, another study found that exocomet signatures in the Kepler light curve don\u2019t fit what\u2019s going at Tabby\u2019s star. Given that natural explanation after natural explanation were falling flat with this star, the idea that gigantic alien megastructures could be blocking the light was starting to be considered. Now, even that doesn\u2019t fit as later researched showed that whatever was blocking the light, at least with the most recent dips measured from the ground here on earth, was not opaque, and that dust in some bizarre juxtaposition around the star was the cause. But there\u2019s still the question of the missing infra-red. To date, no one yet knows exactly what\u2019s going on at KIC 8462852. Number 1 Pryzybylski\u2019s Star At the time when the KIC 8462852 story was a media hit, it was often called the strangest star in the universe. And while it certainly was strange, this final star on our list gives it a run for its money. The star is called Pryzybylski\u2019s star after the Polish-American astronomer that first studied it. The star is what\u2019s known as a peculiar star, a class of stars that are chemically unusual in some way when compared to other stars. But even then, this star stands apart because it contains elements that really shouldn\u2019t be there and are more at home in a laboratory on earth than in nature. And it\u2019s not just a handful of odd elements, it\u2019s a lot of them, in sufficient quantities to be detectable at great distance in the star\u2019s spectrum. Elements like praseodymium, ytterbium, technetium and prometheum are present, the last only discovered through the activities of the Manhattan project. Certainly odd, but stars can have odd elements in them. But there\u2019s more, the star is also anomalously low in iron and nickel, abundant elements in the universe, but perhaps strangest of all are the very short-lived actinide elements higher on the periodic table than uranium. Quite a few of these are present, and it\u2019s just weird, but one in particular raises an eyebrow. Plutonium. Plutonium is thought to be produced only in minute quantities in nature, and only under specific circumstances. For this star to have it in abundance is a mystery, though hypotheses have been put forth that you might be able to get to elements higher than uranium if the star were bombarded by a neutron star, or some unknown nuclear process within the star is creating them. But it\u2019s worth mentioning that in 1966 Carl Sagan and Iosef Shklovski hypothesized in their book \u201cIntelligent Life in the Universe\u201d that one way for an alien civilization to announce its presence to others would be to add plutonium to its star. Thanks for listening! I am futurist and science fiction author John Michael Godier currently planning Halloween episodes for both channels, this one and Event Horizon, like to that channel below. Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I\u2019ve been busily filling my house with dried ears of corn and various carved gourds as is the custom here and be sure to check out my books at your favorite online book retailer and subscribe to my channel for regular, in-depth explorations into the interesting, weird and unknown aspects of this amazing universe in which we live.", "e4PTvXtz4GM": "Translator: Taim Noaman Auditor: Hani Eldalees Good evening ladies and gentlemen, My name is Art Benjamin and I am a \"mathematics magician.\" And that means that I collected my love for mathematics - Or as I should say mathematics - And magic to practice what I call \"the magic of mathematics.\" But before I start, I have a quick question for the audience. Did it happen by accident, that any of the audience is here May I bring a calculator with him this afternoon? If you have one, maybe on your phone, or somewhere, You are very comfortable to use it, raise your hands. I need two people to help me here. I see one ... two ... and maybe another one ... three. Bring your three calculators with you, and join me here on stage, And let us applaud these volunteers. Go up here. (clap) Great. Here on this side, please. Gorgeous. Since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators, I only need to make sure it is working properly. Who will start and give us a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Just to tell us one number Audience: 74. Arthur Benjamin: Oh, well. this is good! 74 And another number ... What about another number of two numbers? How about this side? Audience: 39. Arthur Benjamin: Multiply the number 74 by 39 using the calculator. Make sure to get 2,886, otherwise calculators won't work. Did each of you get 2,886 result? Clap for them! (Sighs) (clap) I noticed that some of us took a little while to get the result. this is good. I will give you a short way to do the multiplication faster on the calculator. There is something called \"square number\" What most of you know is that we take a number And we hit him by himself. For example, the square of number 5 would be ... 25. The square of number 6 will be ... 36. The square of number 73 will be ... another thing. Yes. (Laughter) On most of these calculators, there are few shortcut buttons That allows you to get the square of numbers faster The thing that I will try and do is find a square- And you can try that - make sure you can get the square of number 5 and 6, But the thing that I will try to do Is to find the square of three numbers of two numbers in my head, Faster than they can do with their calculators, Even if they use the shortcut method. But I will ask three people in the third format - one, two, three. Each of them tells us a two-digit number And if you try to get the square of the first, second and third number, I will try and race you to get the result. So quickly, a two-digit number, please? Audience: 24. Arthur Benjamin: 24, great, next ... What was that? Audience: 98. Arthur Benjamin: 98 .. another one .. Audience: 26. Arthur Benjamin: Would you please tell me your answers? The first volunteer: 576. Arthur Benjamin: 576. The second volunteer: 9,604 Arthur Benjamin: 9,604 The third volunteer: 676. Arthur Benjamin: 676. Clap for them, please! (clap) Let me go further. I will try to find the square of some three-digit numbers. This time, I won't even write it down. I'm just going to recite it as I was told. Can any of you give me a three-digit number, Can anyone on the stage check the answer? If you answer correctly, raise your thumb. If I make a mistake, let me know and I will try to fix it. Anyone give us a three-digit number? Audience: 576. Arthur Benjamin: 331,776? The second volunteer: Yes. Arthur: Yes? good! How about another three-digit number, sir! A number of three numbers? Audience: 103. Arthur: 103 is 10,609. The method is very easy! Another three-digit number, please? Audience: 125. Arthur: 125 is 15,625, but this is the number 5 raised to the sixth power, so it was very easy. How about another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 985. Arthur: 985 is 970,225. Yes, thumb up, if correct. Another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 926. Arthur: 926 is 857,476? Thank you very much. (clap) (Sighs) (clap) Let me go further. I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time, I will not overcome you in solving this question, But I will try to get the correct answer. To make this a little more random, What if we used the fourth format, four people. Each of you calls for a single number ranging from zero to nine, Which is going to be a four-digit number and what I'm going to squared. One, five, seven, seven. 1, 5, 7, 7, this is going to take a little bit of time, so bear with me - three millions - (Sighs) (Laughter) 486,929? Both? Well, don't tell me. The number was 1, 5, 7, 7. Oh, wait! Three million - so good so far? Oh, is it where you got it wrong? I never make mistakes, wait. Oh. Two million, is everything all right? Volunteer: Yes! Arthur: Thank you very much. (Laughter) It is only one million? That's all I asked for. (clap) Now I will try to square a five-digit number, and I can do that. Unfortunately, most calculators cannot do this. So, since we got as hard as our calculators could do, And although some of you can skip this, I will try to conclude the first part of this presentation, By trying something more difficult. Let's take the first number on the board here: 576. Can each of you enter the number 576 in his calculator? Instead of finding the square number this time, I'd like you to take that number And multiply it by any number four you want. But don't make it too easy like 1000 or 1234, But some four-digit random numbers. So you will get an answer Either a six-digit number or maybe a seven-digit number. How many numbers are there in your answer, six or seven? Seven. six. Is there any possible way for me to know Which six or seven numbers do they have? Say \"No\". Audience: No. Arthur: Good. Then I will try the impossible, or at least the hard. What I would like each of you to do is give me Any six of your seven numbers, Or five numbers from the six-digit number as in your case In any order you want. One number at a time, and I will try to determine the numbers that were excluded. We will start with your six numbers, please say which five of them. The first volunteer: 8, 0, 9, 3, 8. Arthur: 8, 0, 9, 3, 8, did you exclude the number 8? Yes, that's one. You have a seven-digit number. Say six numbers, loud and clear. The second volunteer: 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4. Arthur: Did you exclude the number six? Arthur: That is the second. My chances of getting the three numbers right were purely guesswork You will be one in a thousand: i.e. 10 raised to the third force. Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six numbers. Mix it well this time. The third volunteer: 9, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4. Arthur: Did you exclude the number six? Volunteer: Yes. Arthur: Great, let's applaud these three people. Thank you very much. (clap). For my next number ... (Laughter) I have another question for the audience. Did it happen by accident, that any of the audience here knows On what day of the week were they born? If you think you know your actual birthday, raise your hand. We will start with you. In what year, please? Audience: 1992. Arthur: 1992, and what month? Audience: July. Arthur: What day in July? The third of July. Was it on Friday? Audience: Yes. Arthur: Yes, excellent. another person? Yes sir, with the green shirt. In any year? Audience: 1992 Arthur: 1992, and in what month? Audience: June Arthur: What day? Audience: Thirty Arthur: Tuesday? Audience: Yes. Arthur: Excellent. Another person, what about you? In any year? Audience: 1995. Arthur: Sorry, in what year? Audience: 1995. Arthur: 1995 and in what month? Audience: June. Arthur: What day? Audience: 26. Arthur: 26. Was it Monday? Audience: Yes. Arthur: I see a hand raised from above, a young lady. I'm going to try something different here. If you were sure of your birthday, what year was that? What day of the week was that? Tell me beforehand today. Audience: Tuesday. Arthur: Tuesday. Well, and in what year? Audience: 2002. Arthur: 2002. Was it on May 2nd? Audience: Yes. Arthur: Yes, but this is my daughter's birthday, I know that. (Laughter) I was there for that, on Thursday. However, I have never tried this before. Do we have anyone here who doesn't know which day of the week was born? But does he want to know? Well, let's see. I will tell you. Now, of course, if you don't know what it is, I can give you an answer. And you may believe me. But I don't want you to do that, so I was prepared for this. There is an app for everything these days. So, I'm just going to ask one of you here to take this and ... So tell us the year and then write the year in this blank box. Which year? Audience: 1995. Arthur: 1995. So I write 1995. Great. And in what month? Audience: September? Arthur: September. Click the September button there. Should it give you a calendar? What day of September? Audience: 21. Arthur: 21. I think it was Thursday. Can we be sure? It was on Thursday. good. I will tell you something, You know, since you have this app, Let's try something more difficult. This application can actually reach the year 3000 in the future, It dates back to the year 1600 in the past. But do not go below the year 1600. So we're going to give up the Gregorian calendar and this thing confuses me a little. (Laughter) So, what year do you want? Choose a year between 1600 and 3000. Go. Audience: 2730. Arthur: 2730. So enter 2730 into the app. Which month do you want? Audience: June. Arthur: What day of June? Audience: Thirteenth. Arthur: 13, is it Friday? Audience: Yes. Arthur: Yes, and he will be cloudy that day too if I'm not mistaken. Thank you very much. (clap) In fact, anyone else who wants to know his birthday, To meet me in the lobby, maybe at rest, I would be very happy to tell them. Now, there is only a little time left, so I'd like to do something else for you And that I mentioned earlier when we had the calculators on stage. I will try to square a five-digit number, This requires a calculator with ten numbers or more. Do not hesitate to take out your calculators at this point. But to make my mission more exciting to you as well as to me, I'm going to solve this last dilemma and I'm thinking out loud, So you can actually really hear it What is going on in my mind, While I do a math of this size. Let's create a five-digit number. Why don't we ask sin here in this corridor, The five people across this path, to give each of you one number, And that would be a five-digit number. three. Seven. six. nine. One. 37,691 squared, this is exciting! Let me explain to you how I will solve this issue. I will divide the issue into three parts I'm going to square the number 37,000 In addition, to the square of number 691, In addition to the number 37,000 multiplied by the number 691 multiplied by the number two. Add these numbers together so that you may get the answer. Now, let me explain one more thing. As I do this math, you might hear some words, instead of numbers, Sneak into the account. Let me explain what it is. It is a verbal symbol, a memory utility that I use, It gives me the opportunity to convert numbers into words. I store them as words, and later I retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated, but it is not. I don't want you to think, You will see something here with \"exceptional abilities\". (Laughter) There is definitely some madness to this - Sure, sure. sorry. (Laughter) Latest advice for the jury with calculators. Now who got the answer in the front, raise your hands. Well, that's enough. There is a 50% probability that I will make a mistake in this matter. If I make a mistake, do not tell me what is wrong, Just say, \"You\\'re close or something,\" And I will try and find out which is something that will be very entertaining in itself. However, if you are right, and whatever you do, Do not keep it for yourself. Make sure everyone knows that I got the correct answer, Because it will be the big conclusion, OK? So, without any further delay, Let's Begin. I'm going to start solving the problem from the middle, 39 times 691. Now, let's see - oh my gosh - so it's 700 minus 9 I would benefit from that, 700 times 37 is 25,100. 37 times 9 is 333, subtract the result to get 25,567. 25,000 - Do I think so, yes - 25,567 multiply that to 51,134. - 51,134 OK - 51,000 becomes late tomorrow, late tomorrow is 51134. That sounds right, I will continue. Next, I'm going to square 37 which is 1369, so I can say a billion. Take 369 and add to the light. will you be ??? We add 369 lights to get 420 million. Tomorrow, tomorrow, ok. Next, we will quadruple the number 691, which is 700 times 682, plus the square of the number 9, and the result is 477,481. Mat, if you need, mat, take 477. We add that to tomorrow to get 611,481? Audience: Yes! (clap). Arthur: Yes, good. thank you very much all. I hope you have enjoyed the magic of mathematics. I am Arthur Benjamin. Thank you so much. (clap)", "T0Z73Zbtlyg": "You are watching ColdFusion TV. Hi. Welcome to another ColdFusion video. In previous ColdFusion videos, we've often seen the success stories of some of the largest and most influential companies. But what about the other side? What about the blunders? missed opportunities, and utter disasters that in turn, brought some companies to ruin. Well today, you're in luck, because here are six of such stories. let's get straight into it. Number six: Kodak had the first digital camera back in 1977. Whenever technology changes the landscape of an industry, there are some businesses that adapt and thrive, And others that continue to do the same old thing, until it's too late. For Kodak, who fell behind, due to the advent of the digital camera, the situation was a little different. Kodak actually patented the first digital camera back in 1977. It was one that used magnetic cassette to store images of about 100 kilobytes. However, Over the coming years, Kodak made so much money off of film, That they let the new technology gather dust, not realizing its potential. The company continued to focus on traditional film cameras Even it was clear that the market was moving towards digital. When Kodak finally gone to the digital market, They were selling cameras at a loss and still couldn't make up enough sales to catch up to those competitors, which have seen the potential of digital cameras early on. Currently, Kodak is losing over two hundred million dollars a year. The lesson learned: In the world of business, always keep an eye on the market, and be responsive to future trends. if not, it cost you everything. Number five: Excite could have bought Google for less than one million dollars. The year is 1999, and Excite was the number two search engine, behind Yahoo. Google back then was a nobody. The new kid on the block. It was in this setting, back in '99, That Larry Page, offered to sell Google to Excite for $750,000 according to Excite's CEO at the time, George Bell, The $750,000 deal was 1% of Excite's worth, So financing wasn't an issue. The hiccup came when Larry insisted That if the sale went ahead, Excite was to replace all of its search technology with Google's. George of Excite, thought that this was too much, and refused the offer. Excite was eventually bought by Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com) in 2004. At the time, Ask had less than 2% search market share. Google, currently now known as Alphabet processes a billion search results everyday. They currently have around $147 billion in assets, which is more than 196,000 times what Excite would have payed for them. Ouch. Number four: Blockbuster Video turns down the opportunity to buy Netflix. The mid-80s to late 90s, where when VHS was king. The problem back then, was that VHS tapes would cost upwards of $97 per movie. For this reason, video rental stores, like Blockbuster came in to fill in that gap. They were the perfect solution, and became a regular part of weekend plans for hundreds of millions around the globe. [Blockbuster Commercial] Eventually, online video streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu and even Putlocker destroyed the old video rental business model. Ironically, In the year 2000, Netflix proposed that it would handle Blockbuster's online component and Blockbuster could host Netflix as an in-store component, thus eliminating the need to mail DVD's, which was Netflix's business model at the time. According to an interview with former Netflix CEO, Barry McCarthy Blockbuster just laughed Netflix out of their office. But, that's not the end of their story. By 2007, Blockbuster was well on the right track. They had an internet movie component, that was steamrolling over Netflix. Netflix was struggling, and their upper management wanted to sell the company to blockbuster to save face. Blockbuster's growth was very strong at the time, so they turned down the offer. In a strange twist later that year, there was a boardroom dispute over Blockbuster, that saw a change of CEO. The new CEO was James Keyes (formerly of Seven-Eleven) He came in with the wrong mindset, and thought that Blockbuster should be a retail business instead of an entertainment one. Because of this, He didn't see the value of an online component. Huge mistake. Within eighteen months, The new CEO had lost Blockbuster 85% of the company's value. And within three years, Blockbuster was filing for bankruptcy. Blockbuster went belly-up, and Netflix went on to thrive. Since then, Netflix is behind such original shows such as: House of Cards, BoJack Horseman, and Daredevil. With 83 million subscriptions worldwide, Netflix has altered the way many view the entertainment. Number three: A grade school math error cost NASA $125 million. Before the advent of Google, did you ever get frustrated with the conversions from feet to meters? Inches to centimeters? Did you find it difficult? Well, you're in good company. As it turns out, a similar math problem hindered some of the greatest minds in the western world. In 1999, A Mars orbiter, that Lockheed-Martin designed for NASA was lost in space due to a simple math error, in where the engineers at Lockheed used Imperial measurements while the NASA employees used metric ones. The mismatch led to the thrusters not recieving vital navigation information, which caused the 125 million dollar spacecraft to malfunction. The probe was forever lost while trying to get into orbit around Mars after a 286-day journey. There were numerous occasions where the errors should have been caught, but, it wasn't. Number two: Nokia outright refusing to use Android. Nokia. One of the most iconic brands of the 20th century and even up to the first decade of the 21st century. The company had about 51% market share on the mobile phone industry at their peak in 2007. But now, they're a shell of their former selves. A fond, but distant memory for many. The start of the company's fall from grace can be attributed to one moment in 2010, when Nokia CEO Anssi Vanjoki snobbed his nose up at the idea of using Google's Android software. You see, at the time, Nokia had their own operating system called Symbian. After the release of the iPhone in 2007, the software development team at Nokia realized that there was a threat. So they split into two. One team tried to revamp Symbian, and the other team created an entirely new operating system named MeeGo. The problem was, that the two teams were battling for resources from Nokia's top executives. So in essence, there was an internal struggle within the company. It was so bad, that whenever Nokia was dealing with outside stakeholders, like chip manufacturers for example, there was so much squabbling within the company, that it took the better part of the year to make a decision on anything. in the tech world, that's way too long. Competitor innovation waits for no one. The logical solution, in hindsight of course, was Android. Nokia could have used the open software platform, combine it with their in-house hardware, to quickly make up for lost time, at minimal cost. Instead, Nokia CEO at the time decided to skip on Android, calling it a short term solution likening the move to, Quote: \"Pissing in your pants in winter to keep warm.\" Nokia kept on working on their own software efforts, throwing $5 billion a year of  R&D at the problem, but no avail. As time went on, The iPhone and Android handsets dominated the market until Nokia's mobile division was left in the dust. not long after this, in 2013, the Nokia division brand was salvaged by Microsoft for scraps. Microsoft couldn't make the once legendary company stay afloat either, Wasting $8 billion before killing the Nokia mobile brand. Moral of the story, Move with innovation, and don't let your pride cloud your judgement. But wait a second, there is a twist here. Nokia, the company from Finland, is said to be returning in 2016, after signing an exclusive agreement with HMD Global. HMD Global is a new company, also based in Finland. The deal will see the creation of Nokia brand mobile phones and tablets for the next 10 years. So, I'll see how this one plays out. Number One: Xerox, yes the printer company hand one of the greatest inventions in computing history to Apple. Imagine having one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century in your hands and giving it away because you didn't understand what you are holding. Xerox did just that with the Xerox Alto. The Xerox Alto was an experimental computer from 1973, created at Xerox's Research Center. The Alto was way ahead of it's time. It was the first modern desktop PC, as we recognize them today. It had a mouse, windows, file managers, and it can copy and paste, delete and move files, It had icons, menus, graphics, and even a Local Area Network, that connected all the computers together. The idea was to mimic an office desk, but on a screen. A paperless office of the future. Absolutely revolutionary for 1973. What the Xerox Alto was demonstrating was the first Graphical User Interface, or GUI, in a desktop computer. For those of you not familiar with this time in computing technology, This is how a typical computer from the late 1970s looked and functioned. Before GUI's, to do absolutely anything to a computer you needed to type commands in lines of text. If you mistyped anything, that was too bad. The computer would just spit out an error, saying that it didn't understand. Pointing and clicking on a graphical object was a foreign idea. Thousands of Xerox Alto's were built at the Research Center, but never sold. Only used heavily in Xerox's offices and at a few universities. The Xerox upper management did not understand what they had, the managers just couldn't see, the vision of what the computer of the future will be. But, a man named Steve Jobs did know what the future of the computer could be. And Xerox handed it straight to him. Here's how it went down: Xerox at the time, needed a way to make their experimental technologies, like the Alto cheaper. They saw Apple pumping out their Apple II's for a cheap price. So in 1979, they invited Steve Jobs over to their research institute, to see if they could help reduce the cost of production. The deal saw Xerox gain a million shares of Apple's stock In exchange for Steve Jobs was getting the inside information for everything cool and revolutionary that was going on at the PARC Center. Nobody actually checked with the guys at the research center, but the Apple Business Development Team signed off the deal anyway. The following is from Larry Lester, a Xerox Research Center scientist, and an eyewitness to when Steve Jobs was handed everything. Lester: So, during that demo... uh, Steve again got very excited, he was pacing around the room and occasionally looked at the screen. He was  mostly just looking and then reacting, and taking it all in and trying to process it. And uh, and one point, he said you still not showing us everything. And the meeting paused,  and there was some phone calls, and okay, we gonna show you more. But, Jobs was there going: \"What is going on here? You\\'re sitting on a goldmine!\" \"Why aren\\'t you doing something with this technology?\" \"You could change the world!\" And, There were his buddies, who would trying to, you know arrange a negotiation of some kind. We're tying to quiet him down [audience laughs] Don't be so excited. But he was, he was really clear to him that we were never really gonna do anything with this. Ah, the irony was when they left, we'd still showed them like 1% of what PARC was doing. But it was enough, that it got really excited and decided that they were gonna retarget the LISA to be something like what they seen in terms of GUI, they fell in love with the mouse, and uh, that changed everything. And 7 months after that, I was working at Apple. Jobs: And, within you know, ten minutes, It was obvious to me that all computers would work like this, someday. Basically, they were copier heads, and just had no clue about, uh a computer, what it can do. And so they just grabbed the feet from the greatest victory in the computer industry. Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry today. The graphical approach to the computer appealed to the human mind because commands were now replaced with movements and objects. So, it felt natural, Typing lines of text was now a thing of the past. The ideas from the Alto would heavily influence the Apple LISA, whose technology trickles down to the Macintosh, which influenced Microsoft Windows. Both of which, were the eventual ancestors to the manner in which our phones operate today. An the sad thing is Xerox never gets mention for any of this. Anyway, that's the end of the video. Those were 6 huge blunders by some top companies. I hoped you liked it, give it a thumbs up if you did, subscribe if you are new to this channel, and this video was a lot of work, so i would appreciate it if you'd share this video with someone who would be interested. Also, as another point, If you guys would like to suggest videos, I've opened up the floor on my Patreon, So, if you are a Patreon, you can take part and suggesting what the next video's gonna be. Thanks again guys, This has been Dagogo, you have been watching ColdFusion, and I'll see you again soon next video. Cheers and have a good one. ColdFusion. It's new thinking. - Captions mostly done by 81wsk", "tIuj-oMN-Fk": "That we want to talk about today It is why fasting intermittently And low-carb diets succeed While doing after calories does not seem to work The problem with caloric theory is It is really wrong Because we do not yet fully understand the problem of obesity That is why we cannot address it I am sure many of you have watched this program Called 'The Biggest Loser' It is shown in North America, Australia and all over the world And what happens is that there are contestants They battle for weight loss And they are subject to a diet It is a low calorie diet And they do a lot of exercise You saw Gillian and Michael (presenter) screaming at everyone There are a lot of exercises And they don't show it on the screen But in fact, there is a severe reduction in calories as well It is not a low-starch diet It is similar to eating moderation The problem, of course This program is broadcast for a long time There are a number of contestants They went out and said that this system really does not work The reason is that not all of the contestants did so Is that they are under a court order confidential They are not allowed to talk about these topics But some of them have already spoken So this contestant Susan said \"They never filmed an episode where the old contestants gathered.\" \"Why? They have all returned to their previous weight.\" This is not limited to the \"Biggest Loser\" program. Lots of diets We all made these low-calorie diets And they all work the same way It works well for a period of six months but after that The extra weight comes back Weight loss stops Then the weight begins to rise And everyone knows that Because everyone made this diet The question is why? This is what we must understand This is what I mean when I say that we must solve the problem of the two storage compartments in the body I will explain that later Diet The Biggest Loser Program Although we all know it does not work Indeed, it is highly ranked For example, the US News Agency last year Diet put the biggest loser In third place for weight loss And in the eleventh place in general Presumably an excellent diet Why not, which is about The method of eating less and moving more Calculate calories in eating Raise your calorie burn, and you will lose weight That is why it is so common Because all doctors recommended and promoted it ... etc. The problem is There are some scientific studies That were made on these contestants It is scientifically useful to consider What is actually happening To these people They follow a system (eating less more mobile) The Biggest Loser Program, of course It adopts the activation methodology You eat a lot less And it moves a lot more For this you get the results of a large weight loss In a season of seasons They took these contestants They made them sign consent They conducted their metabolism analysis It is interesting At first it looked amazing Of course we all saw that program And the body of the rider before and after is awesome And the study supports that When looking at the analysis before and after And the amount of fat lost In the sixth and thirty weeks At the end of the program week 30 You can see that they lost Really big weight! Here is 60 kg This shows fat mass Most of it is fat They say you will lose muscle No, they generally lose fat A little muscle loss however occurs In general fat This is the percentage of fat in their bodies It goes down steadily The average rate is from 329 pounds to 202 pounds This is a great result, right? Body fat decreased from 49% to 28% At the end of the program, you have great results All people are happy And pretend that everything is fine But we know that it is not why not? what's the problem? Presumably it should work You have to continue doing the program And you will continue to lose weight! But this does not happen The reason is that we know from about a hundred years Your metabolic rate starts to slow This is what happens to the rate of metabolism For all those contestants You can see black dots This is the basis for their metabolic rate Before they start the program And the void points yet And you can actually see that in all cases These people staged By reducing the amount of calories They burn a lot You can look at some surprising examples For example, this person He started burning 3,500 calories a day And here he came down a lot And it reached to burn 1700 calories per day And it's not just that Rather, everyone happens with them If we take the whole group of people The rate of decline in metabolism Over 700 calories per day When you start burning 3,500 calories This is too much Or 2000 calories you will end up 1200 or 1300 by the end of the program Then she is surprised Why not lose more weight! The reason is because your metabolic rate has become much slower If you burn 1,300 calories and eat 1,500 calories Remember this is much less than what you used to eat You will start to regain weight This is exactly what happens and we all know When you feel cold or feel tired Or you feel very hungry And the weight is back and increasing! Here lies the problem We all know the cause of the problem It is a low rate of metabolism You can try and compensate with more exercises This is what they pretend you can do! You can see the baseline Below is the metabolic rate And the amount of exercises During the program, they burn large amounts of calories With exercises as shown above The total energy burned was better But when you stop exercising 5 hours a day! The exercises drop a lot See here what happens to the metabolic rate This is the rate of metabolism during rest It has already decreased from the sixth week Do not blame yourself, this happens all the time In the thirtieth week it fell more and more Here lies the whole problem You get a slow metabolic rate! Because you are not burning enough energy She is not energetic, energetic and feels so bad And you can see that In this graph This is the biggest losers contestant You see the metabolic rate line going down But there is a similar dangerous procedure He doesn't seem to have that problem The question is why? You can look at the process of linking the stomach The process of linking the stomach stapling the stomach The stomach shrank to the size of a nut You cannot eat You cannot eat for months or months In the end, of course, the weight drops This is not new Interestingly, it works to lose weight in the long run Yes, there are a lot of problems accompanying this To be honest I would never recommend it But looking for scientific analysis The rate of metabolism during rest Compared to the similar big procedure It is gradually increasing The question is why? This is another study of the long-term effect For gastric banding, you can see Starting line and after operation later And between them two years Metabolic rate and total energy burnt That is, the amount of energy you burn It never fell Compared to eating less movement more It continued to decline until exhaustion This is of course the sad part It is the worst thing in the whole journey As we know about the nature of the metabolism process Where it was introduced in 1915 And we knew about it 100 years ago It is very painful that we give people bad advice The need to eat less and move more When they fail to lose weight, we also blame them! This is to blame the victim Here the poor or poor person is the victim Because they suffer from obesity or diabetes They are given very bad advice and know that it doesn't work in the long run We all did and know It does not work every time When the weight returns You say to them you do not hear the speech! You do not have the strong will! You are supposed to eat that sandwich! ..Etc of blame This is too bad So we try to pretend our advice is correct And that mistakes are from all others This does not make sense How could it be 40% or 50% of people Morally bankrupt and they let it happen It does not make sense that the advice itself was bad? It is more realistic We will explain why this difference To understand that We have to understand what happens when we eat The level of insulin rises after eating Most foods have a mixture of micronutrients Fats, carbohydrates and protein After eating, insulin rises to varying degrees Insulin is the hormone that gives your body orders to store fat It stops your body from burning fat And you start storing some sugar and fat This is very normal Carbohydrates turn into glycogen These are glucose bonds in the liver It is the form of sugar stored in the body When you have a lot of it The liver produces fat and is a formed fat And stores grease When you do not eat, that is, when you fast, we mean not fasting at all Insulin level drops This is a sign to withdraw some of that stored energy So you start burning some energy from glycogen It is stored sugar It will draw some energy from the stored grease You can imagine glycogen as a coolant It stores food for energy The reason it is likened to a coolant is that it is easily accessible Where you can put food easily And take the food easily As for the grease, imagine it as a freezer You can store a lot of it But it is far in the basement Hard to reach It is difficult to get food out of it Where you prefer to use a coolant We have the same idea You have two energy storage compartments One is easily accessible and the other is hard to reach The disadvantage of the coolant is that it has limited storage capacity If you put a lot of things, you transfer them to the freezer The reason is that calories don't work Is that it works by imposing a single storage compartment Where they claim that All calories enter one body And that all calories are like some They are stored in a large storage compartment Like this basin And when you need energy They are all coming out one way So when you follow this simple false model Where when you reduce calories Reduce your weight And when the extra calories increase The rate increases But the whole hypothesis is the internal and external caloric model Completely void Because we know that this does not happen inside the body The body does not have a large calorie basin In fact, sugar and fat can be stored Not a large tank for calories stored in the liver This is what they claim to be the situation If you had this whole misconception To explain the process, this will not work The best model then is two storage compartments Where there are two places in the body to store food You have a coolant (glycogen) and a freezer (body fat) Calories enter and leave the coolant Because it is easier and faster But there is a third factor that we have to consider It is the amount of food transported from the cooler to the freezer and vice versa Here is the stall of the Persians Where here are the fats, which are the most difficult to reach The question is, what controls this? Where here is the answer It turns out that the main factor is insulin We know this because insulin prevents lipolysis This means that it stops pulling fat out This is his natural mission If you have a lot of insulin Usually after eating a large meal, the insulin rises It will direct the body to store energy in this direction When the insulin is high, you cannot get the energy in the opposite direction This is the problem For example, if you have a lot of insulin resistance It keeps the level of insulin high It is like this freezer in the cellar It is locked behind the iron You can not get it Well what would happen if Begin to cut calories? When you reduce the incoming calories, you cannot get the stored calories Your body will simply reduce the calories out This is already happening Because he will not lose weight to death! This is wrong When we look at the Women's Health Initiative It is a large study of 50 thousand people They reduced women's calorie intake by 350 today For seven years With an estimate that people can lose 30 pounds in the year In seven years, they can lose 210 pounds Of course, this does not happen How much have they lost? Not even a pound Because what happened is that the body does not get stored fat due to insulin blocking You are only cutting calories It should be noted, of course, that we do not violate any thermodynamic laws Inbound and outbound prices Yes, you can count all of those calories But the most important thing is to know where and the process of storing it This is our topic Not the total energy But where to go This is what we want to know When you eat Burning quickly no problem it will be wonderful But when you eat and turn into fat Then we have a problem It is not a question of caloric equivalence When you eat 500 extra calories And your body burns it all no problem You have no additional body fat And when you eat 500 more calories So insulin directs it here And herein lies the problem This is a problem with the two storage compartments When you look at what happens during fasting Everyone worries about this Oh how about protein will burn muscle right? This is a study by Kevin Hull From the National Health Foundation It focused on what happens during fasting This is what happens For the first day of fasting What you see is that carbohydrate burning is going up You burn sugar You can see the fat index not moving for some days You do not burn a lot of fat Then when glycogen runs out Remember that glycogen is an easily accessible energy But limited storage capacity When it burns all Begins to burn fat You are now burning fat for energy And that's cool This is what we want But what happens to protein? Are you burning muscle? of course not It rises slightly at the beginning and then decreases The protein is not considered a stored energy source Why does your body burn energy You hear this discussion all the time Muscles will burn! This is ridiculous You tell me That the way we design our bodies Is to store energy as fat And when necessary we will burn the muscles! OK I do not think so It is like having a wood stove You store firewood In times of need, the sofa will not be broken and burned This is crazy The other funny thing If you have intermittent famine cycles Like a cave man, for example You store fat and burn muscle At the end of the courses You hate 100% fat. This is like what happens to the bear Do not be silly You do not burn muscle Protein Yes you need a quantity of it To maintain fat-free protein But it does not increase and this is what I mean It is not zero There are some of it But it does not increase with fasting A recent reason for fasting and low-carb diets It does well And maybe better than any procedure Is that it deflates that coolant Remember that what you want to do is Get rid of all of that insulin, too Because when there is no insulin, it directs your body to store that energy into fat Now you can withdraw calories in this direction If you have a lot of insulin And we do that sometimes When we give people exhausted insulin They cannot lose weight even if they fast It is very difficult because they cannot reach that fat Just keep cutting calories The point is Fasting provides the easiest way So you get rid of all of that glycogen And you get low insulin and withdraw from body fat Gorgeous The whole issue why not fast? I asked my son for years how can you lose weight? He was six or seven years old at the time He replied, \"Do not eat.\" Simply said it How can you be so wise This point missed 99% of the world's doctors and specialists If you don't eat, you will lose weight We do not understand that there is nothing wrong with it This is our designer for future As well as lions, tigers and bears This is what our body is designed to do Our body is designed to withstand cyclical starvation cycles Where there is no food The cave man has neither McDonald's nor any cooler It takes days for you not to have anything to eat That's why you found fat in your body It is a common myth Fasting puts you in a state of emergency Brother! This is really ridiculous Because the emergency means The metabolism is so low that you will gain weight I heard this in a previous topic And this is exactly what happens when you try to cut calories If you don't do anything about insulin And only calories are reduced Your metabolic rate is decreasing And you are in an emergency situation But what happens during fasting? Is this also happening? OK Here is a study showing four days of continuous fasting This is for a normal person And what we see above is that weight is dropping This is excellent This is what we expected But what happens to your average metabolic rate during rest and this middle streak This is your metabolic streak It does not come down but rises You are burning more energy than before You may ask why This explanation is very logical Imagine again that you are a cave man There is nothing to eat and time is winter If your body starts to emergency You have no chance of getting anything Because you are tired, you can't go fishing You need to sleep You will die this way But your body is not that stupid Your body says if you have nothing to eat I will supply you with energy And increase the amount of energy as well I will pull it out of your stored fats Because you need to go out and eat and refill that store This is exactly what is happening Otherwise, we are not here originally We will be like insects and ants around the world So what happens to the amount of oxygen for consumption This is the amount of oxygen that you burn Is it going down? No, it just goes up Once again You have more ability and energy to do exercises Why is this so? First you are burning fat for energy Your body is happy in it There is a lot of fat why not The other thing is Adrenaline level Your body gives you a boost To maintain your high energy level This is what you need to survive So insulin decreases clearly And your hormones rise And remember that obesity is caused by hormonal imbalance When your hormones rise, they provide you with the ability to burn fat So there is no emergency Quite the opposite You can do something called intermittent fasting It is fasting on and not According to studies, a complete fast is not counted It allows you to eat 500 calories on fasting days It is not considered a fast but the calories are very low and you will get some benefits If you look at the rate of metabolism during rest The first line You can see it from start to day 22 Several weeks of intermittent fasting Low metabolic rate Fat burning rate It increases and rises You burn fat This cannot be questioned You can measure these things, as you burn fat Why? Because you do not have carbohydrates to burn it She ran out of that cooler All the stored sugar has been depleted Fat is burnt and this is excellent This is exactly what you want The second myth: you will burn muscle Repeat and repeat The idea that you will burn protein for energy never happens This has been known scientifically for 20-25 years When looking at urea The long column is here They are proteins broken down in the liver You can see that you secrete an amount of nitrogen every day Also take a quantity of nitrogen every day This is in the normal state As for fasting Where there is no food What happens is that urea is not produced And nothing comes in too What we notice is that you do not burn muscles Because in the event of muscle burning, the level of urea is very high At least equal to this But the truth is your body constantly protects protein And muscle mass This is what happens when fasting You can do 70 days of intermittent fasting 70 days more than two months And what you will see is When measuring the amount of fat and the amount of muscle As in this study you can see The amount of fat decreases well from 43 to 38 And the amount of muscle does not change at all These are some of the myths that are transmitted Emergencies and muscle burning! The worse thing is that they say it is never useful Okay, okay If you don't eat, do you think you will lose weight? in fact yes This is not a debate and debate By saying they will not work! Because it will definitely work I did not say that it is easy This is a second topic And can you do this, it will be long I think most people can do it If you can, then you will definitely lose weight Going back to 1960 Various studies have been conducted on patients Where they put them in the hospital and monitored And you can see that people lost weight This is a response to those who say women are not supposed to fast why not? Do you think you won't lose weight? You will even lose If you are under a healthy weight, then you are not supposed to fast He will be in health problems for you But if you need to lose weight, yes you will lose This is exactly what these studies have proven Men lose weight Women also lose weight We can see that the weight loss is stable and continuous There are no twists and turns This is the problem of fastness and weight recovery Fasting has many advantages and benefits There is no other system Where other diets dictate what to do Fasting is the opposite, something you should not do One of the biggest benefits of fasting It is very simple It can be explained in two minutes And everyone understands the crux of the matter Yes, there are differences There is fasting on fats, juice fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting All of these are different types But the common denominator is ease of understanding This is important when people do not understand it They can not do Another advantage is that it is free and available As you know, I always want home meals And get the well-cooked meat broth Actually Most of us do not have time, desire or money For example, if you wanted to eat meat fed with the plant every day It will cost you a lot as well as organic products I do not mean a legacy but it is expensive and some of us do not have money Send me people from the Philippines Saying we have all these things but I can't afford it OK Fasting costs nothing The third feature is that it fits all You can cook whatever you want but it takes time Sometimes we don't have time Fasting requires no shopping, preparation, cooking, cleaning, or even eating! Really nothing Perfect fit The idea is not what to do You just have to avoid it And here lies the difference It is something that you can include The third feature is flexibility It is not like saying you should eat six times a day Sometimes you don't want to eat six times a day Maybe busy But fasting gives you more time You can do it from anywhere You can do it tomorrow Or leave it all next week Then go back and do it You can do whatever you want It is completely flexible You can do 12 hours or 12 days no problem The idea is that you can add it to any diet Because it is very flexible According to your need Let's say you want to follow a rice diet or something You can still fast with it This is the significance If you don't eat meat, you can still fast If you do not eat wheat You can still fast You are allergic to food You can still fast Don't have enough time? You can still fast Don't have money? You can still fast You commute all day You can still fast You do not cook You can still fast And most importantly It has unlimited power Sometimes as a doctor you want to do something But he is not strong enough Keep fasting until you get the results you want As you said if you need, you will lose weight It is impossible that you do not lose weight Can you continue? This is another topic I will not say it is easy Or, you do not need health monitoring Especially if you are being treated with medication But you can start it A person aged 75 years I finish 30 days fast And feel the best World record It is 382 days You can continue The whole idea is that fasting gives you open options Because it is not a diet Not a system Like actor George Castanza, he talks and talks about nothing It gives you power and freedom We are free from all these restrictions We now have all these health problems in the world The main ones are heart attacks, cancer, strokes, diabetes and kidney disease And all of them are due to obesity and diabetes Yes, we have the power to free ourselves Of all these modern diseases Only by applying a method known 5,000 years ago! The ancient Greeks used to practice fasting completely Not for health purposes as obesity was not present at the time But for the benefits of potential energy and complete mental focus After the time of hunger, civilization and food abundance began Religions came later and began to enter periods of fasting When you look at any of the major religions in the world They have fasting periods Celebration periods, too But it is balanced with periods of fasting Religions do not try to kill all religious and followers Not like saying fasting until you die hahaha .. no never They command fasting because there is something essential and useful in fasting It is evident Fasting cleanses the body and cleanses The common thing among the leaders of the three religions throughout history They agreed on its benefit The Prophet Muhammad, Jesus and the Buddha They all agreed to one thing It is that fasting is very beneficial It is especially useful Not only for the spiritual side but for the physical side We need to clean our bodies of these accumulated waste Excess sugar and fat need to be cleaned from time to time Just like cleaning the spring completely By applying the remaining ancient method through the ages We can break free from all of that In the last century, we got rid of many incurable diseases But we have these diseases of the age But we have the method and knowledge, but we should only apply it This is ironic that we do not fast without reason Where everyone repeats and repeats that we have to fast Why not fast? Even my little son deduced the truism thank you", "98n-DTIwW18": "", "ZZZ7k8cMA-4": "Translator: Aseel Obeidi Auditor: Mhmad K. Shamma good morning. Before we get started, please have more lighting in the room. So that I can see the faces of the audience --- The participants that we will have later and see where you sit. This is a little better, good. So that everyone raises his right hand forward like this in a handshake position. Get your legs apart. Comfortable position. Right hand forward. And when I say the word \"now\" to you what we will do. You will turn someone beside you And shake hands with him as if you are meeting for the first time And keep moving until I ask you to stop. Then you will stop and install it Then we will analyze what is happening. Concept? You don't have time to think about this. Do it now. Choose anyone and shook hands, move, all. Move! Move! Move! Install. Install. They stop. Install, install. Keep your hands tangled, keep it tangled. The person with the upper hand says I'll be the boss for the rest of the day. (Laughter) And when you meet people for the first time In the first 4 minutes of meeting someone for the first time You are about 80% of your position on it, right? You decide in the first 4 minutes of meeting someone Whether you will talk to him, you will listen to him, or you will reject him. The first thing that could happen is shaking hands. And I'm going to try some of them in the first row here. One in three feelings comes when you shake hands with others. The first feeling is ... it gives a good feeling. I think you and I will agree well. I think we can work together. I think we will agree. that was good. Let's try a second handshake. OK. (Laughter) I'm just checking my money, checking if it's all there, yes. I felt a bit of awe there. Let's try the third handshake. Yes, you will do whatever I ask of her, right? (Laughter) In fact, all of you have almost the same handshake. But you really feel one of the three feelings. This is related to two things. The first is the angle of the hand, the second is the strength of the hand. I will explain to you. Let us summon the esteemed gentleman in the first row. Can you join me here? Yes? The colleague looks worried. (clap) Come here. This is your modern western handshake. This is how it looks. It has remained like this for almost 2,000 years. If we go back to about 4,000 years, back to the Roman era, You will see on the vases that it looked like this. This is the original position. It has multiple connotations, What was happening was that the commanders of the military forces were meeting after the battle or training. They were always men, so this activity remained masculine until recently. When they were meeting they were doing this. If his arm is stronger, it will go like this. Then you will say: \"He is the owner of the upper hand.\" The upper hand is an ancient Roman expression. If he had the upper hand, his men would have the right In the wine board, when eating, when dancing. My men have to wait. If I go the other way, my men are eligible. If it's in the middle, it's 50/50. This was originally a squatting situation. Now we do it standing. So the fingers are under the wrist instead of above. But basically, we have the same situation. So when the hands get tangled if his hand is slightly up ... You don't have to be on top, just a little bit. I will have a feeling, at the level of the stomach, and we think this is determined automatically Because you have never been trained to identify it. But I have a feeling of being somewhat dominant. This feeling, yeah, I think I'm under control here. And if the opposite happened, I think I took over this fool, right? How do you create a link through a handshake? Here are the two rules. First, keep your hand completely straight. Second, this requires some training, especially if it is female. Press the same pressure pressure as you did. So on a scale from 1 to 10. Let's say 10 is too much pressure, And pot 1 is like holding up to 4 hot dogs. We agreed? Now, let's try again. Well, on a scale of 1 to 10, your handshake is roughly 7. I shake hands with the 7 also. So I felt good. None of us had the upper hand, or the dominant hand. That is why, at the stomach level, we both felt good. I can see the look on your face. You felt good. Yes, that was a good feeling. Yes, it was very good. But what happens if you meet someone who has ... This time you will be shaking hands with 9 and I'm just 7. He shook hands with me intentionally 9. Now the hand will immediately go up. I had to respond by an extra 20% to be more powerful. Because if I don't do that, it'll outpace me before we even start. He will know that and I will know it, without saying a word. Is this logical? clap for him. Thank you. (clap) There are links between your brain and the palm of your hands More than any other organ in the body. Did you know that? More links between your brain and the palm of your hands. This includes both men and women, more than any other organ in your body. So obviously, the palms of the hand have evolved as an important part of the human brain. And they really are. Make your bed. Comb your hair. You do delicate artwork. Shake hands and play the piano. They do more things than most other body parts. But here is my question. When you deal with people When you want to influence, persuade, or be on your side, You want them to say \"yes\" to anything you suggest. Be it work, appointment or even just getting them to accept your idea. Where is the palm of your hands while you are speaking? This is something most people never take into account. Start. After this session you will take it into account, you will think about it. Later on this day, you will begin to realize why people are responding to you The way they do in a way that you did not think before. Here is what I will do. I will say something three times. I will only change what I do with the palm of my hand. I will keep my body as firm as possible, so that I do not use any other body signals. And I will keep my voice with the same layer as I can. I say as much as I can because when you change your body language, It is related to your brain that you change how you talk. I will try to keep it the same layer as possible. And I will use exactly the same words. The same instruction three times. Your mission is to decide. Do you accept what I say, or do you reject me? Do you want to fight with me or be on good terms? Do you want to say yes or no? Well, we agreed? Let's start. The first instruction, do not do this, just imagine what we will do. After a moment I will ask those sitting here on these benches, I will ask you to sit on this side, please. And I will invite those sitting here to take their seats. Those in the back came forward. And in the foreground, sit anywhere you want. Raise your hands if you have no problem with what you asked for. Which of you agree? Raise your hands. Almost all of you are ready to do what I want. Although you do not know what the reason is. But you are ready to do what I want. Because you feel that I will not threaten you, I will not scare you. It may sound silly, but it can be a bit fun. This is what our brains think. Because I used a sign that got your old mind approved. Let's try the second instruction, the same words and the same voice, I'll only change the palms of my hands. I will ask the people sitting on this side And I will invite you to take these seats. People here can sit there. Those at the back, please go ahead. Sit here. And in the front they can sit wherever they want. Give me a word that suits this. What do you feel, word? Feel like you are getting an order? Raise your hands if you feel that you have received an order. Do you want to tell me that all I have to do is change the direction of my palm from my top Where you want to do anything I ask without any question. And now you turned them down and you say to yourselves, Wait a second, this guy gives me an order. Well, maybe I don't want to do that. I am an independent person. I will just ignore it. Make me laugh, funny guy. So how many of you show resistance now? Let's try the third method. I will ask the people sitting on these seats If you can sit in these seats, please. And they can sit here. The back of the room, you can move forward please. Sit here. Those in the front can go wherever you want. Give me a word that fits this, It is not a sign, but a word. (Laughter) I think this was a word. How do you feel with this? This is more than an order. This is a directive. You have no choice and you are also stupid. We have tested what you said in a very simple way. We gathered an audience to sit in a room like this. We got a speaker to make a presentation. They had to persuade the audience to agree to the show within 20 minutes. The lecturer was instructed to do the same three times With three groups of audiences with the same demographics, we only changed the audience. First of all, the lecturer spoke in a position of two hands facing upwards. This is how it happened. And this summary. This will suit you, sir. It will be suitable in Australia and America. This is how they made the premiere. We pulled that group out of the audience and brought in a second set. The same offers were made to the same population, But with a different audience, using my palms hands down. This is how the deal will be done. It will suit you and you. It will work in the United States and Iceland. We brought out that group, we put the third, They got the same width but using a finger gesture. This is how it works and this summary. This will work for you, you and yours. America, Australia and Africa. Then we did a study of the three groups looking for two things. First, with a simple examination, what do you remember about the subject of the deal? We were looking for how much they heard the deal Instead of judging them. Second, from the list of attributes we asked them to choose The best adjective that describes how they feel about the speaker. Do you think there was any difference in your opinion? You already know the answer, don't you? You already know the answer without actually seeing the results. The top two comfort spokesman got a 40% better recall recall. From the bottom rest of the speaker. The top two rest speaker got the best qualities, Relaxed, friendly, humorous and charming. The palms down, bossy tells me what to do and push me. When the finger was used, no one could remember much And the speaker got the worst qualities. Now here is my question. What is your most used hand position? You have a predominant position for one of these, what position? People never care. But you must have one of them to use in your interactions with others. Is it up, down or finger? We know that the palm of the hand is down, historically it is a sign of strength? There is a power in your hands four times when you are facing down from its direction up. I think the famous example here is Adolf Hitler. Nazi salute \"Heil Hitler\". I scared everyone. What would be the result if he had \"Heil Hitler\"? (Laughter) Nobody will follow this \"Heil Hitler\". This is scary, this is submission. But to you is good news. You can change and control your gestures with a little training. When you start doing this ... What will happen if you discover today or night That you use finger pointing? Sitting talking to your friends, you forgot this session. They watch your hand and here it is These silly fools hit their head, forcing them to submit. What distinguishes body language, It is an external reflection of your emotional state. All that body language does is show what you feel. Whatever your behavior or feeling you feel, it will often be reversed In your gestures, movement, or position. The opposite is also true. If you take certain positions on purpose, You will start to feel the feelings that match her. For example, let everyone make this move. As a prayer posture, press lightly back and forth. Draw a small smile on your faces. Toothless. Let this be your behavior. How do you feel when you do this? Yes, you like a good plan. You are smart. You are responsible. The right word for this is confidence. If you feel confident, for example: I know what to say. I'm in charge, I'm an expert. Possibly these appear, you can use them unconsciously. But if you use it on purpose In situations where you may feel anxious or anxious, you will do two things. First, when you mean to do that gesture You seem to feel more confident, that you are responsible. (Sigh), I am responsible for my feelings. The most important thing is that whoever sees you do it, you have a feeling You know very well what you are about to do. You know, when I met that man or that woman, They seemed self-confident. Actually no, they may have been deliberately doing this to create that ... To reassure themselves and make you feel good. False it into reality. If you keep doing this as part of your gesture repertoire In the end, when you do this, you will feel confident What you are talking about, even when you are not. So you can go into politics. (Laughter) Here is my question. What is your most used hand position? Palm up, down or pointing finger? Think about life today, work and personal relationships. They all depend on people in the first place. Is anyone buying you? If someone purchases you, in the first four minutes in particular, He creates 90% of his opinion about you. If they buy you, there is a great chance that they will buy anything that comes before you. What comes before you is what you want them to do. The opposite is also true. If they don't buy you, they won't buy anything that comes before you. Even if it is a good idea. Without this link, they will feel you don't like them. Or that you are a threat or fear. Suddenly, they will refuse to agree to anything you suggest. Even if it is a good idea. So you can train for the palm upward where you want to get a deal. Sometimes you may want to impose some control. Then you will turn your palm down. If the fire alarm goes off in this building, I will say, \"Here\\'s what we will do. We will go out through this exit ...\" I will not say, \"Here\\'s what we will do. I will ...\" Because then everyone will be responsible for themselves. So by practicing poses on purpose ... suddenly, with the palms up, You will find that people begin to feel attracted to you. In fact, during our conversation I was doing \"Obama\\'s hug.\" We want to help the Americans. We want you to come here. Yes, we love you. As if your mother or father embraces you. While his predecessor said We want to help everyone. We want to help. You, you and you! Body language is an external reflection of feelings. If you take certain positions and train them on purpose, You will suddenly change your acceptance of others It will also change your physiology. You start to feel differently than yourselves. This is the wonderful thing about it. You can do things on purpose It gives you a better chance of getting a \"yes\" to work, For presentation, idea or appointment. Or even better.

So how many of you How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family? Maybe there was some split How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family? Maybe there was some split mentalities around money How many of you know what I'm talking about? You know like maybe mom had a certain way of thinking and dad had a certain way of thinking So how many of you guys know who my dad is? My mom and dad got married when they were like 22 years old, my dad flunked out of college Right as a speech and communication major which is pretty awesome considering he's like one of the greatest motivational and real estate training speakers ever right and His mindset because his mentor this is what his mentor said to him you want to make a lot of money go buy a rolls-royce Go get a big fancy watch and go get a really expensive car and a real expensive house And you will be motivated like crazy And you will go do whatever it takes to be successful and guess what my dad did He went up a big fancy car big watch. You know rolls-royce the whole nine yards and every day He was like this. Holy shit. I gotta make money My mom on the other hand Grew up in an environment with a few more kids my grandfather. My mom's mom passed away when she was very young and she Immediately had to go to work at like 14 years old by the time. She was 16 She was working at Disneyland as a Mouseketeer You know Orange County, California, and she's doing great But all of her money went back into the family So she would work only to basically have no for herself benefit from it so in her mind Every cookie in the cookie jar mattered you should be very mindful with every single dollar Imagine growing up in that house This one is like it's not how much money You just need to make sure there's at least one cookie in the cookie jar we could divide it up six ways and my dad's like we should start a cookie factory and finance the entire thing Well, no surprise that relationship did not last long right my dad actually ended up marrying somebody who was ridiculously financially savvy And I think she's somewhere inside the room who are you inside the realm? My my other mom somewhere inside her maybe you're running around the room The bottom line was this I grew up with a completely messed up psychology when it came to money And it wasn't until in my mid-20s when I met one of my mentors who he showed me something which I'm gonna Show you, the bottom line is this guy's money is a tool nothing more nothing less say that out loud Money is a tool nothing more nothing less, listen if you're a jerk money makes you more of a jerk if You are mother Teresa money makes you more mother Teresa It is just a tool, but this is what I know how many of you know someone that doesn't have enough money, I Don't know about you guys. I don't want to be that person and Not that I feel bad for them or less them all I think to myself is That person was never taught what I'm about to teach you They never understood that your money is a tool and just like an app on a phone if you don't use it and play the game right and follow the steps. You don't get the results. It's not how much money you earn It is what you do with the money that matters, you guys with me on this So I want you to write in your notes the following There's been a lot of research on this and you've probably seen something like this before Especially if you've ever met with a financial planner, or you know you've watched CNN financial. They all say the same thing write down 5, 15 and 80. 5 percent 15 percent and 80 percent Five percent 15 percent and 80 percent and as all the studies show it Says five percent of the planet are basically generational wealth They have created generational wealth It's not the top one percent guys somebody who is worth five million dollars Who has paid off their home and when they pass on they Transfer all that wealth over. That's generational wealth you with me on this Some of them are worth millions some of them ten some of them are hundreds some of them are now billions But that's the 5% the 15% write this in your notes. You ready. They are the middle class They got a house They got a little savings. They go on a few vacations, and they're comfortable and there's nothing wrong with that 15% But where do you think the 80% sets? Darcy the 80% 80% 80% look around the room potentially 80 percent of this room I don't think so, but potentially with the numbers 80 percent of this room when they are older either A have to work to make money or B are dependent upon the government or their family to subsidize their lifestyle 80% 80% 80% some of your think to yourself my kids better be successful 5% generational wealth and it starts at five million dollars and above fifteen percent comfortable my in-laws are 93 and 90 years old they have a million dollar net worth there in that 15 percent, house is paid for that they bought for $11 300 years ago right in Anaheim, California on Bruce Street Paid that sucker off Every time I talked to my father law you see my Ford stock Right he's not he started buying Ford stock like in 1948 You with me like I had a dollar that I had two shares then three shares, but over time guess what he's in that 15% How many of you know someone right now though? That based upon their money behaviors, and their money psychology They're clearly going to end up in the 80% Don't point out him if they're in this room and don't like you know make them wrong, but I'd like you to consider Maybe they just never heard what I'm about to share with you So I'm gonna show you guys a business strategy for your money you guys have for that a business strategy I'm not gonna tell you what to invest in that's not my role I'm going to show you ideas of what the very best people do, I'm gonna put it up on the big screen Which means the team's gonna keep it here the whole time? And you're gonna take detailed copious notes, so here's the first thing. I want to show you This is what 80% of real estate professionals do 80% of real estate professionals They get a commission check and that check goes into their personal account their personal account 80% they get a check and it goes into their personal account they go home And maybe they say here honey, or here on by myself, and I put it in my account But this personal account is not an LLC an S. Corp a limited light You know limited partnership. It's not a corporation. It's a personal thing now. I'm not gonna Ask you to raise your hands if that's you But I am gonna say this to you I would like to thank you for paying lots in taxes Thank you very much. I really appreciate you overpaying what you should be paying keep up the good work So what's rule number one? Should I have a corporation yes, or yes? Yes, or yes? so check this out guys if you answered this, don't feel bad I will teach this stuff at conferences And I'm blown away by ten people in the room 10,000 people in the room the number of people that go Yeah, I thought about doing that but like I don't know like which one do I pick I'm no expert Here's what you do you call your Accountant and say I think I need to get incorporated, which you recommend based on where I live What country what state etc? But rule number one is no one leaves this conference in 30 days if you are not incorporated And you don't own your business and now your checks come to blankety-blank LLC not you personally Cuz now you get all the tax advantages yes or no guys But I got to tell you, this is what the 80% does and this is clearly bad. Let me show you What the 15% do. I Want you to draw this out I Want you to imagine a world, where and by the way? Did you guys notice the subtle little difference? This one says check this one says checks Because people that get checks Understand the following, I get the check it goes directly into my business account Right I get it wired in from escrow. I don't get physical checks anymore the money Just gets transferred over, you with me Oh my a escrow company my title coming up won't do it great get the physical check But it goes into a business account, which means now as you can see I'm gonna have four different Accounts at my bank Four different accounts at my bank. I'm get out my business account I'm gonna have my tax account to me three accounts Tax account business account and my home account my personal account Here's the reality my friends if I if I can encourage and inspire You know every single one of you to just do that and then Follow the rule you ready write this in your notes above the tax account I want you to write down let's let's do an imaginary check and I want you to show you how much money goes where so at the top, let's say, that's a $10,000 check, just for easy numbers $10,000 check so all of a sudden $10,000 hits my business account and the first thing that happens is instantaneously 3,300 of the 10,000 goes directly into my tax account 3300 automatically into my tax account because some of you think when you get a check for 10 grand that you actually have 10 grand How many of you are in the state of California or New York or in the country of Canada You get a check for 10 grand, and you're lucky if you get 4,500 That's the real deal now you're an entrepreneur you own your own business you're gonna start taking better write-offs You're gonna pay more attention to your accountant You're probably gonna have your uncle Larry who's done your taxes forever stop and actually hire a CPA who's gonna pay attention? But 3,300 bucks automatically goes there then 3,300 or less goes into your business account and This is where I run my business a check comes in I've got marketing a check comes in I've got expenses a check comes in I've got my MLS dues Everything that I need to run my business every check 3,300 3,300, and then what goes over here 3,400 bucks to my home Now it sounds like you might need a home budget. What do you guys think? Because many times what do we do we get a check and we just start spending the money? By the way if you look at this the very first one. This is the the cardinal sin this is what poor people do they get a check and They just start spending Who knows someone like that say I? matter of fact the bigger the check the more they start spending and they never think about Debt reduction because they'll do that later Because I've worked so hard and this was such a challenging transaction And that's why I'm going to overindulge and over and spend on myself, and we know the financial rollercoaster. You're actually putting yourself through this my friends is What the people do that take care of their money they know Uncle Sam or Revenue, Canada or Mexico? They're taking their money. No matter what so when I commit that Check comes in I don't say to myself I get it all it automatically goes there I leave a piece here, and the balance goes here makes sense so tell your buddy. Are you gonna do this yes or no? Yes or no Now here's what I know look up here guys The number of clients that have done this and then I see them a year later And they go I have $15,000 and my savings kind of never had that but more importantly I paid all my taxes Like I'm on time and I have money inside my business account and it's the end of the year and my accountant said I need to take a Dividend so I'm getting a big chunk of change at the end of the year. This is awesome Now I don't know about you guys, but I like is anybody like nice things You know family trips vacations memories, holidays, you know maybe a new outfit The challenge is if you keep that psychology without requiring or putting in the discipline You know what you end up with a bunch of nice things and a shit ton of debt So do me a favor tell your buddy. Do you know someone personally that has too much debt? Anybody's anybody inside this room Now listen there's smart Debt. There's bad, debt, and I'm not gonna go too in depth with you on this But you know the difference you know credit card, debt at nineteen percent is dumb Debt buying a house and getting a mortgage with three-and-a-half percent is really good debt So we all know the difference, and I just want you to be mindful I want you to take care of your money, but now did you guys get a photo of this? Did you capture it are you sure? Are you promising to do this? Okay, do you want to know what the wealthy agents do? This is what the wealthy agents. Do it's a little more complex It's a little more complex I would get it up on the big screen over there guys and take a photo of it, but more importantly I want you to draw the whole thing out in your notes Draw the whole thing out on your notes, this is what the wealthy do This is the stuff that no one taught me so all until Bill Mitchell Pulled me aside and said what do you do with your money? and I'm like I don't know I just get the check and I throw it inside my account and I spend it like crazy and I never have any cash, and I'm always in trouble Draw this out So play a game with me you get a $10,000 check The $10,000 check goes to what account? to what account and 33% of it goes automatically where To my tax account because I don't really have 10,000. I really have like you know 6,000 and change that's the real deal so 3300 automatically here then I take another 3300 over here or less because I don't know your business expenses But by the way guys here Marketing costs should be no more than 10% of your expected gross revenue Your marketing cost should be no more than 10% of your expected gross revenue So a percentage that 3300 is gonna go for your direct mail and your Marketing and your email and your Zillow leads and your Facebook ads and the prints and the brochures and everything else But no more than 10% No more than 10% got it? Because you're incorporated now your car and a piece of your house and all kinds of other things get written off into or from this account so we like that but you might also have inside there ready guys a Virtual assistant an assistant well, where is that person gonna be paid from you got a check for 10 grand You didn't actually get 10 grand you got 6730 3300 goes inside here now I can pay my assistant it starts to work like clockwork you with me, but you can see This is where it gets interesting Some people call this other account your investment account. I like to think of it as my financial hub It's where the money comes in and then it gets divided again Now I'm not a financial planner nor do. I you know even would even attempt to be, but I'm giving you just an example Of what that extra thirty four hundred dollars could go towards So maybe you need because you do two deals a month you're like I need Four grand a month to come into the home expenses So I'm gonna take you know two grand of my thirty three hundred or the thirty four hundred. Where does the rest go? Do you have a retirement account? Do you put money in the stock market or in bonds or whatever you believe in 401 K Do you have an account where you just put cash? to buy real estate Why not on every check take five percent of every check put into an account called cash for real estate And you just watch that sucker grow like crazy over time I'n two years, and also you're like I got 185 thousand bucks in cash sitting inside that account I should go buy a duplex. I should go buy a four-plex. I now have the money to go do these deals retirement account real estate cash account I use this because I did it you know with my kids a 529 B account which is a college fund Cash account since we did real estate cash. What do we call this the fun account? The fun account you know the I'm gonna go spend this money on stupid stuff and Throw it away later and not care or I'm gonna take this money, and I'm gonna use it for vacations and holidays What action are you going to take in the next 30 days around this conversation? There's no more information. That's it? Tell your buddy What actions are you gonna take in the next 30 days do it right now? Okay thanks so much for watching we have a number of events coming up and we'd love to have you there Visit tom ferry dot com forward slash events and reserve your spot today", "F-nNTGK0wFw": "Translator: H\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8ne Vernet Reviewer: Heba Alshrbagy I\\'ve been called a \"tail spinner,\" a \"wordsmith,\" in the promotions for this TED talk, but I'm not spinning any tails today. I'm going to be presenting before you facts\\xa0based in science and\\xa0History, and I'm going to leave you to\\xa0take a call for yourselves on what this\\xa0all means. We all know this gentleman as\\xa0Alexander the Great. Everyone is familiar with him. But did you know that there is absolutely no archaeological evidence to prove that\\xa0Alexander the Great existed? That's not\\xa0in history books. Everything we know\\xa0about this man comes from the writings by three historians who lived between\\xa0150 and 400 years after Alexander died: Strabo, Arrian and Plutarch. But Alexander is not mythology; he is History. So, I'm going to explore some unanswered questions from the Mahabharata which I've\\xa0been researching now for about 12 years. I'm not going to give you answers, but I'm going to give you some thoughts which I hope will challenge you to be curious about what could be and what is. Here's the first question: Did the Mahabharata\\xa0actually happen? The events in the Mahabharata which is not just the\\xa0Kurukshetra war - that's just 8,800 shlokas - or verses - out of the one lakh shlokas in the Mahabharata - did all the events described there\\xa0happen? It's a very common question. Did the fantastic weapons we hear about in the Mahabharata, actually exist? And if\\xa0they did, how did these people, over 5,000 years ago, have that kind of science and technology? And then, the question that\\xa0led me on my journey, as a fiction writer: Are there scientific explanations for some of the things we read about in the\\xa0Mahabharata? This is a big one which I'm actually currently researching: Were there giants\\xa0in the time of the\\xa0Mahabharata? We hear\\xa0about the Devas and the Asuras and the\\xa0Rakshasas, these enormous beings of\\xa0gigantic stature ... Were they real? Let's\\xa0explore this, but I'm going to start by\\xa0taking you on a tour of the world. We're\\xa0going to talk about some unexplained mysteries and then\\xa0come back to the\\xa0Mahabharata. I'm\\xa0going to start with Egypt. The Great\\xa0Pyramid is one of the most famous\\xa0monuments in the world. It is 457 feet\\xa0high as it stands today, the equivalent\\xa0size of a 45-storey building. We are told\\xa0by history books that it was built in\\xa0about 2550 BC by a pharaoh called\\xa0Khufu, as a tomb for himself. Now when the\\xa0Great Pyramid was built, it was locked. This is its original entrance which\\xa0was only discovered maybe about 50 or 60\\xa0years ago. It was concealed, hidden away by the wall of rock which you can see is\\xa0scattered around the entrance today. So,\\xa0no one could enter the pyramid after it\\xa0was built. It was closed and sealed. In\\xa0800 AD, the governor of Cairo, a gentleman\\xa0called Mohammed Al Mamum, decided he\\xa0wanted to go inside. Why? Because he\\xa0believed if a pharaoh was great enough to build a 45-storey tomb for himself, he\\xa0must have a lot of treasures inside. So, Al\\xa0Mamun and his men tunneled into the\\xa0Great Pyramid using what is today called \"the robbers entrance.\" Tourists enter the\\xa0Great Pyramid today using this entrance. But to his great shock and disappointment, when they reached inside, they found absolutely nothing. The walls were bare, no inscriptions. Unlike all the\\xa0Egyptians tombs he would discover, there\\xa0were no inscriptions on the walls. There\\xa0was no mummy and there was no treasure. He must have been a very sad man. Now, this is the lower hole, the robbers' entrance; the upper one is\\xa0the original entrance; so you can see\\xa0what I'm talking about,\\xa0a close-up of these. What is also very interesting about the Great Pyramid is the maze of passages and tunnels inside. And you can see that if\\xa0this was built as a tomb, they'd have had\\xa0a one heck of a time carrying the\\xa0Pharaoh's body up these passages because\\xa0none of them are on a straight line. They are\\xa0all at crazy angles. Let's look at some\\xa0of the angles. Look at the Grand Gallery. This has a ramp today which you can see at the base of the photograph. This\\xa0ramp enables us to climb it, but when it\\xa0was explored about 150 years ago, there\\xa0was no ramp, and you can see how\\xa0difficult it is to walk by yourself, forget about carrying a corpse with you. Most of these tunnels I've showed you, the network of tunnels, most\\xa0of them are about 2.5 or\\xa03 feet in height, like this one over\\xa0here, and this one over here, which means\\xa0you have to crawl on your hands and\\xa0knees to get through them - not a great\\xa0job if you're carrying a Pharaoh's mummy\\xa0around. So the question really is: why? Why\\xa0was this 45-storey building built 5,000\\xa0years ago locked away with all\\xa0these passages, three chambers, and\\xa0interestingly, tunnels from the King's\\xa0Chamber that opened up to the sky, like\\xa0this? This is where it opens up in the\\xa0north face of the pyramid. From the\\xa0Queen's Chamber, there are two tunnels which were explored about 15 years ago. This is a National Geographic capture where you can see the\\xa0tunnels are blocked. So why build them? Unanswered. There are lots of speculation, but I'm\\xa0not into speculation today. The Sphinx is\\xa0another fabulous mystery. We are told that the Sphinx was built by the Pharaoh Khafre who was Khufu's son, and therefore build about 2500 BC. For a very long time, this was accepted History. You can see how big the Sphinx\\xa0is by looking at the size of the human\\xa0being next to it. This is just the\\xa0shoulder, the neck and the head of\\xa0the Sphinx. It's an enormous structure. Here's another shot which shows you the size of the Sphinx. In the 1990s, a professor of geology at Boston University, Dr. Robert Schoch, came along in the scene and asked the Egyptologists a very interesting\\xa0question. He said, \"How do you know that\\xa0the Sphinx was built in 2500 BC?\" The\\xa0fascinating answer was: \"Well, we actually\\xa0don\\'t know. We think it was built in 2500\\xa0BC because you can't date stone. If you\\xa0would you date it, it would be billions of\\xa0years old, right? So, Robert Schoch, being a\\xa0scientist, said, \"Not good enough for me, I\\'m going to run some geological tests.\" And his tests shocked the world because what\\xa0his tests showed was that the erosion you can see on the Sphinx and on the\\xa0walls of the enclosure surrounding the\\xa0Sphinx were caused by heavy rainfall, and\\xa0we know for a fact it has not rained heavily in Egypt after about 5000 or\\xa06000 BC, which means the Sphinx could\\xa0not have been built in 2500 BC. It had to\\xa0be older than 6000 BC, probably even\\xa0eight, nine, 10,000 BC, we don't know, but it is an old monument, and the\\xa0question then is: who built it? We were all\\xa0cavemen and cavewomen in those days,\\xa0right? We were using stone tools. We\\xa0didn't have the technology and the science to build a massive structure like this... Yet, somebody did. Let me take\\xa0you now to Stonehenge in the United\\xa0Kingdom. I visited this as a\\xa0tourist about 12 years ago, but only\\xa0while I was researching for my last book, did I actually spend two weeks researching this deeply on site. And I\\xa0discovered something about this that\\xa0blew my mind: 70-ton blocks of stone put upright and 70-ton blocks of stones on top. The stones lying flat on top are also 70\\xa0tons. The first question is: in 2400 BC, which is the officially accepted date\\xa0for this, how did they do it? How did they\\xa0lift these stones 30 feet into the air and put them on top with this complex engineering involved here. This is called\\xa0a \"mortise and tenon joint\" in carpentry - in\\xa0modern carpentry, but they obviously knew\\xa0it. Each of\\xa0the upright stone has these two\\xa0projections called \"tenons.\" The mortise\\xa0holes of the stones on top fit onto them, so\\xa0it locks the stone in place. And if you\\xa0look carefully, there are a tongue and\\xa0a groove joint, like a jigsaw puzzle, on the\\xa0sides of the stones. So not only do you\\xa0have to lift the stones, but once one\\xa0fits - that's great - the second stone has to fit the tenon, the mortise tenon joint has to fit as well as the tongue and groove joint, and\\xa0you're standing here, pulling it 30 feet\\xa0in the air, with possibly only ropes to\\xa0help you achieve this. In the 1950s, they\\xa0reconstructed Stonehenge using cranes, but in 2400 BC, they did not have cranes. How did they do this? Here you can see the mortise holes. Here's a shot of one\\xa0of the tenon projections. Here, if you\\xa0look very carefully, you can see the\\xa0tongue of a stone on this stone\\xa0that is flat on top. Let me take you to\\xa0Wales. This is a fascinating place; when I\\xa0saw it, again it blew my mind because\\xa0magical things happen\\xa0here, and I'll tell you just one of them. This is supposed to be a burial chamber at a place called Bryn Celli Ddu, The\\xa0entrance of this chamber faces northeast. Every year between December and\\xa0April, the sun rises in the northeast - it rises in\\xa0the northeast in winter in the Northern\\xa0Hemisphere. It shines through this\\xa0entrance and illuminates a stone pillar which is inside the chamber. Now, it's no big deal, right? The interesting thing\\xa0is that the stone chamber is where the\\xa0blue line is. It's not in line with the\\xa0entrance, so, obviously,\\xa0light from the Sun is reflecting off the walls of the\\xa0chamber and illuminating the pillar, and\\xa0you can see it's reflective. It's quartz-lined rock. Here's the magic: I don't know\\xa0if you can see, there are grooves cut\\xa0into the rock. Here's a close-up; you can\\xa0see it clearly now. So here's what\\xa0happens: Every day, starting from December, the Sun shines in through the passage and illuminates a different notch every day. It climbs from\\xa0the base of the pillar in December to\\xa0the top of the pillar in April. This, my\\xa0friends, is a 5,000-year-old calendar. Just by looking at which notch is illuminated, you know the day of the year\\xa0in winter between December\\xa0and April. Built in 3000 BC, we are\\xa0told by the archaeologists. Five thousand\\xa0years ago, how could they build a\\xa0parabolic mirror, which is what the walls of the chambers are? How could they do something like this? It's amazing. Unanswered questions. Now some very interesting theories were advanced, about\\xa0twenty years ago, when I started\\xa0researching this. One of the pioneers in\\xa0this is a gentleman called Graham\\xa0Hancock. He and other people of his\\xa0ilk used a lot of science to create a\\xa0theory saying that there was an ancient\\xa0global civilization, that had advanced science and\\xa0technology and was washed out by a\\xa0global flood 12,000 years ago. Interestingly, recent discoveries have provided fascinating evidence\\xa0for this. So in 10,900\\xa0BC, we now know a comet hit the Earth. It shattered into fragments and hit the Earth at different points which is\\xa0now marked by what\\'s called the \"Younger\\xa0Dryas boundary,\" and melted the ice cap. The ice age was anyway getting over. Sea levels rose causing a global flood. Volcanoes erupted; ash filled the atmosphere. For 1,300 years, temperatures dropped sharply as you can\\xa0see, I'll just show you. These animals in North America went extinct altogether. One of the biggest mysteries, until this discovery was made about the comet\\xa0hitting the earth, was why these animals\\xa0all disappeared at the same time 12,000\\xa0years ago. This is a report from an ice\\xa0core from the Greenland ice cap which\\xa0shows that 15,000 years ago, there's a spike in temperature. The ice\\xa0age is ending and then suddenly, the\\xa0temperature plummets below what it was during the Ice Age. That is when the comet hit. One thousand three hundred years later, the temperature returns to normal. Another fascinating discovery made in 2008 - I don't know if you've heard of\\xa0this - this archaeological team working in\\xa0Russia in a cave called Denisova, discovered a tooth, a big tooth. The surface area of this tooth is about two\\xa0and a half times that of our teeth, a\\xa0human tooth. So they thought this must\\xa0belong to a large now\\xa0extinct animal, like some of the ones I\\xa0just showed you, and they sent it for DNA testing to try to figure out who it\\xa0belonged to. Imagine their shock when the\\xa0DNA test came back saying that this\\xa0tooth belonged to a human being, a human\\xa0species which we did not know existed\\xa0until this tooth was found, not Homo\\xa0sapiens which is what we are - Homo\\xa0sapiens sapiens - but they had to give it\\xa0a new name, they called it the \"Denisovans.\" I'm going to share three amazing discoveries which you'll find in the\\xa0scientific reports about the Denisovans over the last nine years. The first is\\xa0that all the people living today in the\\xa0geographical areas covered by the Green\\xa0Land, which is quite substantive, all of\\xa0us have Denisovan DNA; 2.4% of our\\xa0DNA is Denisovan DNA, this is a fact. The second interesting thing was this bracelet. The Denisovans lived about 30 to 40 thousand years ago. This\\xa0bracelet is about 30 to 40 thousand\\xa0years old. We believe it was made by the\\xa0Denisovans. I'm not going to dwell on\\xa0the beauty of the bracelet, but focus\\xa0on that small hole at the side of the\\xa0bracelet which is one millimeter in\\xa0diameter - very small, very fine. The\\xa0scientists who ran physical tests on this hole say that it could\\xa0have been made, and I quote from the\\xa0report: \"it could have been made only using a high-speed drill,\" otherwise\\xa0the stone would have\\xa0shattered. A high-speed drill 30,000\\xa0years ago? This was also\\xa0mind-blowing: Just like we have Denisovan\\xa0DNA, the Denisovans have DNA belonging to\\xa0another human species which we have not\\xa0yet discovered. There are still mysteries out there waiting to be solved. There're still\\xa0discoveries waiting to be made, if we are\\xa0curious enough to challenge our existing\\xa0beliefs and look for the evidence. Science is opening up the way now. I'm going to now come back to the Mahabharata's unanswered\\xa0questions, and I hope\\xa0I'm going to leave you with thoughts, not\\xa0answers but thoughts... that will lead you\\xa0to curiosity to learn more about this. Did the events described in the Mahabharata actually happen? There is absolutely no archaeological evidence to prove that the events of the\\xa0Mahabharata\\xa0happened. There is also no\\xa0archaeological evidence to prove that\\xa0Alexander the Great existed. Is it\\xa0possible that the weapons described in\\xa0the Mahabharata actually existed? Did\\xa0they have the scientific knowledge to\\xa0create those kind of weapons? Can there\\xa0be a scientific basis for some of the\\xa0things described in the Mahabharata? We can't say for sure. What we do know for sure is that 30 to 40 thousand years\\xa0ago, there were people who we didn't know\\xa0about until now. There were people who\\xa0had some kind of technology. We don't\\xa0know what it was, but they did. We know\\xa0that they had engineering techniques, like this one and the one at Bryn Celli Ddu, to create complex buildings, some of\\xa0which we can't do today. We could not build\\xa0a Great Pyramid today if we wanted to. The Sushruta Samhita written in 1000 BC is a manual on brain surgery, and one of its techniques called the \"flap technique\" of plastic surgery, is\\xa0still in use today, in the 21st century - a\\xa03,000-year-old text. I found this\\xa0very interesting while researching: The sulbasutras written in the\\xa0first millennium BC, first date of what we now\\xa0know as the Pythagoras theorem. They used geometry; and the square root\\xa0of two is defined. Let me very quickly\\xa0show you. In those days, in the Vedic age, we had altars. We didn't have temples, we\\xa0had altars. This is one example: four\\xa0levels - A, B, C, D; each level had a different type of brick, hence\\xa0A-B-C-D; 196 bricks. It could not have been made without the use of geometry. This is the Baudhayana Sulbasutras' definition of\\xa0the Pythagoras theorem; it is there. And the square root of two is pretty close\\xa0to our modern value. Were there really giants in the Mahabharata? Denisovans must have been a pretty big\\xa0people. I'm not saying they are the\\xa0people in the Mahabharata, but it's\\xa0interesting. So I'm going to end here and like I said, I hope I've given\\xa0you enough to challenge your thoughts and look for more. Thank you.", "VAIs8VLFbls": "what I'm going to do here is I need to shift this log roll it so that the heart cracks on both sides are level yeah see this is the heart crack through here generally most logs will have heart crack and I want to cut that I'll just make a mark so you can see it easily yeah I want to be able to cut that out when I start cutting slabs so both sides have that heart crack lined up level I can't roll it this way because I'd be going uphill so you'll be rolling it until it's vertical or until it's all real quite a ways to go mmm so this log is about two and a half feet diameter 30 inches and it's a eight-foot log well probably nine for you I usually cut about a foot extra so this is how the pyramids were built and rocks were moved yeah but a big piece of machinery would move pretty easy but just me yeah if highways  Wow so the heart cracks one in each end they're both slightly different to each other with the casting they play twists the log twisted wood it grew probably yeah so you're kind of find the average I'm finding the average basically I want two four inch thick slabs under this to make a big bench and so fortunately the heart's way down here so I'll probably get my two slabs here easily okay the sides off with my chainsaw because I don't need to do all the milling with my Alaskan mill with that because this is all gonna be exterior so I don't want any SAP wood if it was gonna be interior I would rip the whole thing because then you get all that width but the SAP wood really rots quickly outside so you'll cut the outside off and turn it into firewood yeah just like here just like that very cool  okay I should be able to see enough of that now that it's not look at a straight line how often do you have to sharpen the saw well as long as you don't hit during anything with this kind of work not too often probably every year just four or five times I mean cut yeah it's just so that if the teeth are pretty equally cut and the same angles and sharp the saw doesn't start veering to one side it'll make a cut just pretty straight  another advantage ripping the sides off or peeling the bark off yes when you go to use your Alaskan mill it's a lot easier to cut because the bark really clogs up even where your cut is so I won't have any bark on this when I go to make my gonna be really clean  you have your foot under there when you're cutting down that bar is going through can you see it yeah yeah cut the end your foot off you gotta really watch it yeah when you're doing this kind of stuff yeah sure it's happened before  good they okay looks good so what I'm doing is I'm taking the bark up because I want to set my rail to set up my Alaskan male you don't have to do that but it makes it a lot easier just set that just set it up yeah and de nailed it on cuz you got to nail it onto the log yes so harder through the bark so what exactly is this bar um using is what the bar this is just a bar that's older than I am I got it from my father that's probably 70 80 years old uh-huh this is for its uh originally I think was used for setting best put fence post so you put your post in and then you tamp it down like that around the post  multi-functional oh yeah I must have yeah I use it leverage yeah it's just great for leverage I couldn't move his log otherwise yeah that makes it peel off like a butter  the logs been sitting here for months sometimes it gets a little easier to take off okay what I'm doing now is I'm putting this rail that I've made it's straight and each side is parallel to each side on the rail so if I get this set up correctly I'll cut a even slab off of the blog with my mill so what comes into play now are the lines I've made because that means that I can measure down to this level line that I created earlier on each side of my guide here then on each side over there and then I'll be able to cut down to the line with my Alaskan meal so this you call this a board what do you call this as my guide you guys did you make you use this for all your jobs have you made it for this job oh I use this for all of my milling jobs I made this a number of years ago I have another piece that goes on to it and I can cut 25 feet long so this is twelve and a half inches on this side and I have 12 and 3/8 on this side so and shim it up a little and try to get that  twelve and a half so after I get it all Eve equal on each side I'll nail it to the log so on this side you're also bringing it to 12 and a half inches right yeah twelve and a half inches to the line from the top of the board on each side of my guide and each side of the each side of the log so now I'm at 12 and a half here and twelve and F here now I have to check the other side because I pivoted it may have changed mm-hmm twelve and a half inches from the top of the guide in all four positions on both sides of the log so now I'll nail it down and I can use my Alaskan mill great so when you nail it down are you nailing through those shims on purpose through the sham so they stay in place because the Alaskan mill really vibrates a lot and in my brain out so the nail goes through the guide through the shin and into the log  you just feel make sure it's dirty so you had holes there in the guide before so you kind of use the same holes over over and over sometimes it just depends on where I'm nailing it doesn't matter yeah okay now the one thing I nail the other side AII it just to make sure it's parallel and that's the advantage of having these two two sides mm-hmm and they're very close to parallel I could read this maybe a sixteenth of an inch  so if you want a flat slab like how are you determining whether it's completely parallel in Flash well I'm eyeing this edge get backing up and eyeing this edge and see that it meets that edge so it's not tweaked to is not tweaked in any way right and I'm just trying to raise this one edge about sixteenth of an inch right now I have the two sides parallel now great and if this was a longer log if it was say a 12 or 13-footer over put shingles in the center here then I'd nail it there too but this doesn't have any give in this short distance okay I only need two sets of shingles and nails to keep it accurate enough yeah okay the part where I was measuring the 12 and a half inches from the top of the guide yeah on this nailed to the log yeah because now what I want to do is I want to add up twelve and a half inches here before I put that top board on well first of all let's this is the Alaskan mill this is Alaska mill you can buy setups that are aluminum got bars that an adjustable but they get a bit pricey and you can make your own pretty easy yeah this is my Husqvarna that has a 42 inch bar on it I drilled two holes in it and put in a ready rod bolt folded and stays in place pulled it on both sides with what lock washers and then you just drill this so counter drill it so that it sits on the bar its depth thing stuff to like a step yeah so now I have all these different size blocks and I need to add up to twelve and a half inches so I'm at and I need two and a half more inches so I should have  okay there's 12 and a half so I'll just repeat that on this side so is it a particularly strong saw well it's a good table it's an old so I've had it for over 20 years mm-hmm and it's held up really well it's a big saw yeah so this is what an Alaskan mill is it's not like a it's a chainsaw with a set up on this chainsaw with a set up on it sometimes you have two chainsaws one on each side just depends on how how big a cut you're making and how big your saws are you don't have to have this big ax saw you can have a smaller saw you're just gonna be cutting smaller pieces of wood is all  that will cut right down through that line that I have on the log  I used to use just a 2 by 12 for my guide this works a lot better but a 2 by 12 will work this is about how much well this is an age structure Hou sees a plain bored playing to the instruction structures this is like a beam structure so it's a lot stronger so when I go ahead and make this cut I use a gas mask along with iron ear protection because I'm sitting right next to that motor and the fumes come right up at me and they're pretty toxic so it's a good idea to protect yourself from it yeah why more so than with a regular chainsaw well when I'm cutting with the regular saw my head's quite a ways away from the saw head and there's a breeze going through and so the wind is really taking it off I'm not getting it but with this you're really sitting right in there with it okay so now with the set up I have this board will run down the top of this now I'll be cutting right along this line and it should meet on the other side where the line is - no yeah this cuz everything is parallel and I did it with a level no and that's why I needed to shift the log so that the heart crack I was cutting out was the level tooth and then to this board for the ride along the top of that board yes while you're sewing and the bar will will cut right through that line so we'll see if it does yeah okay okay  when I first put the board on I put it on backwards and there's a reason that I have it longer on this side just for safety I like to have the board go past the end of the bar it's too easy for someone else to walk up and walk into that bar when it's when the chains running and get cut really badly so right now we're looking at how it's going to be while you're cutting right and so if somebody walks up they're gonna get to the board before they get to the the chain moving because that'll cut through you pretty fast yeah okay well I'll get the chain saw started now so just hangs on bouncing on the wood  nice come out in the line yeah good very impressive okay so now I'll remove the nails and then we can cut from the surface that I created we don't need this anymore I like how you put the shims in that makes sense they're as thick as the as the blade yeah if you don't put the shims in it drops down on the bar then you're cutting width and it'll bind your chain what you're gonna make out of this big block of wood on my pond where I have the koi I'm going to take two slabs and make a circular bench area  break your foot I can't live something like this how happy to think the top slices what's that how heavy is the top slice gonna stop sighs I would have to guess just 500 pounds I mean this is Greenwood yeah it would probably break your foot or break your leg yeah so you lever it off oh yeah I can't lift it  so now I'm going to go for cutting a 4 inch slab and so now I just change my block setting to 4 inches perfect and they should both be the same yeah so we got 4 inches now  so you have to be pretty handy to want to do this to be able to do this oh yeah it's quite a bit of work for everyone it's not for everybody but on another hand where can you go buy a 21 inch 4 inch slab that's 8 P or 9 feet long of Redwood that's all hard to cut a bench out of yeah these logs over here actually I'm just gonna be cutting into material like the two by they're in stump or by because I'm going to be replacing a d\u00c3\u00a8cadence 20 years old so that you could just go out and buy all right I've got the material here for big slabs so it just makes sense to use it because I had to take the trees down anyway so a lot of your house you would have made the boards actually no I fell the trees but I had a mobile dimension milk up ah that would be just too much to do yeah that's uh I had a twenty seven thousand board feet of material cut up so that was like a look like a lumber yard I wouldn't be able to do yeah the most I've cut off it any one time is about 3,000 feet that's a lot of work  okay now I can cut off of this flat surface that I've created for my next 4-inch slab so you don't need your border you don't need the board you only need it the first time for the guide for the first guide yeah because now I can you look at this it's a really nice flat surface I mean it's really nice straight and flat super plain yeah so you wouldn't use these shingles until you're actually working along you just place them ahead of you yeah yeah just get them in place  mmm mmm mmm mmm  pretty good it's quite dangerous there I mean you're using your your foot it could be you have to be very very aware of what you're doing well it helps push it down there because you are actually pushing it and it's kind of hard to reach over and push with your arms the whole day I know yeah your legs a lot stronger yeah okay we got a slab beautiful so I'll take it off and put it on some stickers they're parallel with each other and so that it dries fairly flat  oh nice board nice board huh ready for another chicken ass and then I should miss C on both sides  wow it's sure looking different around here cutting these logs there's just a little bit more to cut but some of my piles are very close to where the log is so I'm gonna be moving this wood to another location and then I'll finish cutting up that one log there ah sorry it's only about a foot away from your stack of wood right I need quite a bit of room for the saw because the blade extends you know a couple feet so maybe you've got like 30 or 40 boards here since we were last with you oh yeah yeah I cut up this time in a combination of two by and four by I just cut up according to what my usage is going to be yes so I have to replace a deck and so I'll need some 4 by material and then a lot of 2 by so that's how I decided to cut this time so on top of the pile there's like a thinner board yeah what I do often is I cut out the center where the heart goes through because often there'll be a crack through that and it makes the wood not usable so I'll cut like I cut just an inch out here and it's just not a very usable it's not reusable so I just cut that out because I don't want that crack to go into the next piece like this was the next piece uncut and it's a floor boy and I don't want that crack going into it so then I just use it as the cover board I see there's a little crack there in the end yeah crack here you can see it a little more clearly these are a couple more that I'm not you seeing right now cover boards but see this crack mm-hmm see it goes diagonally vertically in some areas and kind of diagonally oh yeah making the wood pretty useless in that area yeah except for a cover board yeah cover board good and I might you recover a little bit of the wood but not much yeah then sometimes you notice that one's even it's one inch everywhere this one goes from about two inches to one inch yeah sometimes the crack that goes through the heart which is typical in most trees you'll get that mm-hmm it doesn't it's not going parallel with my cuts the way I laid out the log it twists it'll twist as it moves through and this one twisted a bit so there was more waste on one side so what I do is I just used my guide again that I have right here when I get down to the heart crack and I set it up on it and then I can cut out a shape that I take more out on one side than the other so I don't get that heart crack into the next piece of wood into your primary boards that you're cutting right so now these cover boards will you be able to use them later or like what happens to them with like how many months will you leave these wood piles stats to season it just depends on what the usage is uh-huh the deck I'll probably use it in a couple months mm-hmm it'll dry some it's not essential that it dries mm-hmm because when you go to the lumberyard and buy redwood to build a deck it's wet mm-hmm it just depends on the usage right the one thing about the cover board though is it does help keep the top piece out of the Sun because the Sun does make it crack more quickly and more more quickly until it's dried to some extent so you leave these board these stacks of wood summer on your property out in the weather for a number of months oh yeah with your hoverboard yeah yeah see what happens is if if this is exposed to the Sun before it dries to some extent yeah this top part will dry before this bottom part too quickly one dry evenly mm-hmm and so that that means that part of the piece of wood is bigger than the other part and so then it starts doing all sorts of weird things because it's not dry drawing evenly yeah great yeah so anyway this is the project almost completed now almost completed and ready for me to just so these remaining pieces with lots of bark on them they can become firewood yeah all the rest of the material that I've left that I've cut from already will become firewood just as I have stacked between the trees and this is the one log here that's very close to the pile so you'll shift the pile of wood and I just don't want to double have to double move it so I'll move the pile of wood where it's gonna go and then I'll finish well it sure is interesting yeah it's an interesting way to produce your own wood if you have it you know the trees on your property and you need to take them down yeah yeah not not easy work no not easy work but then on the other hand you either are going to go to work and earn the money yeah to buy the wood or you or you do this and you have the wood you just get all the in-between stuff wonderful yeah yeah very cool great thanks sure you bet go mill your own wood", "awtmTJW9ic8": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs Reviewer: Ellen Maloney Imagine this... You have just won ten million dollars in the lottery. Congratulations. (Laughter) You have just eaten the most delicious, warm, chocolate brownie that has ever been baked. (Laughter) You... have just had sex. (Laughter) And you... have just done all three at the same time. Congratulations to you, too. (Laughter) In these situations, our brains produce chemicals called neurotransmitters which give us these great feelings of energy, excitement and happiness. And without such chemicals inside of us, we wouldn't feel such emotions during such pleasant circumstances. So instead, imagine this: You've just been fired. You're about to sit an exam. You have depression. In these situations, our brains, instead, produce different chemicals, making us feel stressed and anxious. The highs and lows of life are controlled by our emotions and these chemicals in our brains. This vital organ inside all of us that controls everything that we feel, think and do. However, as a biologist, I've always found it strange to comprehend that every feeling, thought, and action that we have is controlled by a three-pound, soggy lump of cells inside of our heads, until I discovered that this might not be the case. The story I want to share with you today unfolds a fascinating new revelation in our understanding of human physiology, that we each have a second brain, another organ in our body which controls as much of our physical and mental functions as the brain in our heads, and which may be the key link between modern disease epidemics, globally, from obesity to cardiovascular disease, maybe even to mental health. But first, to give you a little introduction to this story, I want to tell you a little bit about my background. I was brought up in a family of psychologists. My mom is a clinical psychologist; my dad a professor of psychology in a university; my sister even has a PhD in psychology. So when it came to me going to university, I wanted to study something different. I'd heard enough about the brain and how it worked at home so I wanted to study something new. I considered what I was interested in, and I figured out that from a very early age, I'd had a big interest in food. I loved eating food. So, I decided to study human nutrition. And this was great because I got to study food, how it affected our bodies, how it could contribute to disease, and more importantly, how we could use it to fight and prevent disease. This story begins back in 1845 with the birth of a curious young boy in Russia who became an incredible man, but who was forgotten by history and medicine. Ilya Mechnikov was fascinated by everything in nature, and by the age of eight, he was taking notes on all the living things in his vibrant back garden. He became so good at science that he discovered the role of phagocytes, some crucial cells in our immune systems, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1908. But it was his science after winning the Nobel Prize that was even more crucial to our understanding of human health, through a tale of discovery, death, and self-experimentation. See, everyone in this room has something in common. We all spent the first nine months of our existence inside our mothers' wombs. And this was essentially a sterile environment where no other living things existed, just you. But as you emerged into this world, you were smothered in an invisible coating of microbes, friendly microbes from your mother's birth canal. And these bacteria grew to form what is now a three-pound invisible organ inside your large intestine, the same weight as your brain, and which has become known as our microbiota, or microbiome. And this invisible organ has grown so much, in fact, that right now, 90 per cent of the cells in your body are bacterial cells; only ten per cent are your own human cells. So you are more bacteria than you are human. (Laughter) This ecosystem of microbes in your gut is as diverse as the Amazon rainforest. Thousands of species all with different functions. And your health is incredibly dependent upon the life and vibrancy of this rainforest. Your gut bacteria digest certain foods, produce essential vitamins and hormones, respond to medicine and infections, control your blood sugar and blood cholesterol levels. Meaning the types of bacteria in your intestines can significantly control your risk of certain diseases from obesity to diabetes, maybe even osteoporosis. They're involved in just about every process in your body. They function almost as a second brain. Well, Ilya Mechnikov may have figured this out himself in 1892. He lived in France, in Paris at the time, where a deadly cholera epidemic had broken out with thousands of deaths. Naturally, as a scientist, he decided the best way to study this was to drink a broth of cholera himself. Remarkably, he didn't get sick. So again, as a true scientist, he needed to increase his sample size, so he recruited a colleague to do the same thing. This guy didn't get sick either. But when he recruited another colleague to do the same, this poor guy got critically ill and very nearly died. By studying cholera under the microscope, Metchnikov found that certain species of bacteria from the human intestines supported and stimulated cholera's growth, while other species prevented it. He subsequently claimed that our gut microbiota, or our gut bacteria, were essential for human health, and that the right balance of microbes inside of us could help stave off disease. However, popular understanding at the time, was that the human gut was a noxious reservoir of toxins. Surgeons had even begun removing entire sections of human intestines in patients with gut discomfort. Mechnikov's death in 1916 meant that his ideas that our gut bacteria were good for us were forgotten. A decade later, antibiotics were discovered, and drastically became overused. C-sections became common. Diets became Westernized. A war was waged on microbes and we spent a century trying to kill them, which turned our intestinal rainforests into barren wastelands. This Nobel Prize winner's ideas were lost in time. Some of the implications of this were identified recently. See, right now, one in three children in America are born by C-section, meaning they don't get this initial innoculum or coating of bacteria that's been designed by evolution to be in the mother's birth canal. Instead, they're first coated with other bacteria on the skin or in the hospital environment which has contributed to up to a 25 per cent increased risk of obesity, asthma, immune deficiencies and inflammatory bowel disease in later life. Fortunately, in recent times, we've realized we must restore our relationship with gut microbes for our own physical health. However yet, we've still completely underestimated their role as our second brains. And this is something that I'm researching. And I learned this first through the intriguing story of a mouse. If mice become colonized by the microbe Toxoplasma gondii, an intriguing thing happens: they lose their fear of cats. (Laughter) In fact, they become attracted to cats. (Laughter) In essence, they go a bit mad, and unfortunately for them, usually end up as dinner for cats. (Laughter) So, this microbe ingested by this animal takes control of its brain, and changes the way that it thinks and behaves. So, by delving deep inside the intestinal jungle of bacteria in our intestines, we've begun to find some incredible discoveries that are changing our appreciation for bacteria forever. See, our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways. First of all, our intestines are physically linked to our brain through the vagus nerve which sends signals in both directions. Interestingly, even though if this is severed, our intestines can still continue to function fully without a connection to the brain, suggesting they have a mind of their own. Secondly, our brains are made up of a hundred billion neurons which continuously send messages to tell our bodies how to work and behave. Well, interestingly, our guts have a hundred million neurons. Thirdly, our microbiomes are the centerpoint of our immune systems, meaning a disturbance down here can cause subtle immune reactions all around the body, which if prolonged, can affect brain health. And finally, do we remember our chocolate-eating, lottery-winning womanizer here in the front row? He demonstrated for us the neurotransmitters are these chemicals that can change the way we think and behave, and how we feel. As it turns out, most of these neurotransmitters are also produced in our gut, none more so than serotonin, nature's antidepressant, 90 per cent of which is produced in our intestines, less than ten per cent is produced in our brains. Meaning the types of bacteria inside of you may control the way that you think and behave. Has stress ever messed with your insides? Have you ever had a gut feeling? Or butterflies in your stomach? You may have to think twice about that. So, you can see, despite my naive reluctance as a teenager, I've begun to study not only one brain, but two brains. In the APC Microbiome Institute in Ireland, we're fascinated in this link between our belly and our brains, and we research how our modern diets and lifestyles are impacting this gut-brain relationship, and how we can design interventions to target the microbiota in order to prevent and treat chronic diseases. For example, we've shown that the types of fats that you eat throughout life can drastically change the types of bacteria that decide to reside in your intestines. In addition, we've shown that by feeding specific strains of bacteria, it can enhance memory, stress behavior, and stress hormone levels in animals. And in addition to a number of other researchers worldwide, we've identified lists of foods that can act as prebiotics, or foods that can stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria inside our intestines. To me it's fascinating that our health is so dependent not only upon nourishing ourselves, but upon feeding other living microorganisms inside of us, meaning future strategies to target and treat chronic diseases, including brain health, may depend on targeting or feeding our gut microbiomes. As it turns out, Ilya Mechnikov may have known this himself. See, much earlier in his life he married, but his wife quickly became sick with tuberculosis and died. The stress and trauma of this led Metchnikov to take an overdoes of opium. Thankfully, he survived. He then re-married, and when his second wife got sick with the deadly typhoid fever, this time he injected himself with a deadly tick-borne disease. Thankfully, he survived again. It was only after this, Metchnivok began studying and appreciating the microbiota. He moved to Paris to work in the Pasteur Institute where he began hypothesizing the right balance of microbes in the gut could help stave off disease, and he published a series of books and lectures describing how to achieve this and prolong life. Despite the stress and mental turmoil that he'd experienced in earlier life, he spent the rest of his life dedicated and obsessed with researching how to prolong human life. He began studying an interesting group of people in Eastern Europe who were living exceptionally long lives, and he noted that they all drank bacterial-fermented milk every day and he suggested that this contributed to their longevity. Interestingly, he began drinking this bacterial-fermented milk himself, and seemingly lived a healthy life rid of the stress and mental turmoil he'd experienced in earlier life. Maybe that was just coincidental. He described the time in Paris as the happiest of his life. But Metchnikov died in France in 1916 at the age of 71. The life expectancy in France at the time was 40. As humans, we all need to adopt a greater appreciation for the microbes inside of us. The incidental war we've waged on bacteria over the last century has led to bacterial extinction and sparked an epidemic of modern plagues. I'm here on a Fulbright to research how we can restore our relationship with microbes, and how this can be used to prevent and treat chronic diseases. But I feel that we all have the responsibility and the potential to follow in Ilya Metchnikov's footsteps. Not only to revive his scientific findings that were lost in time, but to adopt his desire to prolong healthy, human life. Whether it's by educating ourselves on the risks and benefits of C-sections, restricting unnecessary antibiotic use, or by adopting a gut-friendly diet and lifestyle, we can all support the life of microbes that we've evolved to live alongside. So imagine this: Imagine you've just eaten chocolate, or won the lottery, sat an exam or just been fired. Imagine your thoughts, your emotions, your behavior, and your health could be controlled by a hidden organ that you knew little about. Ilya Metchnikov fought to not only prolong healthy human life, but healthy microbial life. I feel we can all contribute to this fight worth fighting for our own health, but more importantly, for future generations' health by restoring the relationship between microbe and man. There is some food for thought. Thank you very much. (Applause)", "6l4kr36TzQ4": "In 2015, the space community is exciting. That's because before that, the best image we had of the Pluto system was this. Hubble also stuck its lens on Pluto, but it is so small and distant that it is the best See a few spots of color change. But in 2015, all this changed. That's because after a nine-year journey, the New Horizons space probe was flown by a dwarf. Planet, give us a detail and loyalty to pluto and its moons like we have never seen prior to. So the question is, what is the new horizon? See and discover during flight The Pluto system? My name is Alex McColgan, and you are looking at Asturum. Stick to me in this video and I will show you all the highlights of New Horizons Mission to Pluto. Pluto is the last of the nine traditional planets to be explored. This is because of its distance from us, but also because-can you believe it-it Not considered a very interesting object. Thankfully, New Horizon's team has facilitated this task, which is difficult to obtain approval for, and In 2006, New Horizons became part of NASA's New Frontier Program, Medium Budget space tasks. The goal of the mission is to reach a new horizon of Pluto, and so, a new horizon The fastest launch ever, it is the most powerful rocket on a light spaceship Time-Atlas V. It quickly passed the moon in only nine hours. The Apollo mission took 10 times longer. On the way to Pluto, it used Jupiter as a gravity aid, cutting back 3 years Time of arrival. It also uses Jupiter as its commissioning system, shooting some extraordinary videos and Image of the planet and its satellites. After this successful test, New Horizons goes into sleep mode to prevent wear And its instrument tears. The team used its approach to bring the system back online in 2015. The image sent back by the spacecraft that day shows the Pluto system. For lovers, this is a very exciting moment to follow this story. We started to get hints that Pluto could get that might look like, how different we saw Pluto comes from its largest moon, Charon. Every day, resolutions are getting higher and higher, and more details can be made. Yes, there are other science goals missions, but the most interesting thing To me this is what it looks like. You'll soon see what a dwarf planet looks like! On July 14th, the results of the New Horizon survey showed that the closest place was only 12,500 kilometers The surface of Pluto. However, the mission controller knew it without a glance. First, the detector was too busy to send any photos back during the flyby immediately. Once the data transmission starts, they have to do this to deal with the slow speed of only 1kbit / sec. In addition, there is a 4.5-hour delay between the spacecraft and Earth. But what it saw and sent back was spectacular: mountains, ice fields, glaciers and glaciers An atmosphere. It also has a good look at some Pluto moons. Let's take a closer look at exactly what it was discovered in this flyby. One of the first things observed Pluto and its unusual relationship satellite. First, Charon, Pluto \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest moon, orbits very close to Pluto, and In contrast, it is very large. This means that the center of gravity objects of both, in other words, their centers Quality is beyond the main target. They actually all move space around a point. Not only that, but the two objects are very trendy. This means that if you stand on one, the other will not move from that point in the sky. This is very unusual because although some satellite tides are locked on their parent planet, The planet has not been neatly locked to the moon. Charon is visually distinct and darker than Pluto This means that they are not from the same origin. The remaining moons of Pluto are very small, only a few kilometers. Their orbits are very circular and coplanar with those of Pluto. The geology of Pluto is very interesting. The biggest visible feature of Pluto is this huge heart shape that marvels the world It appeared first. It was later named Sputnik Planitia. This is the size of Texas and it has a strong color that contrasts sharply with the surrounding area. This is because it is a huge ice field. In fact, during the flyby, it was confirmed that 98% of the surface of Pluto is composed of Nitrogen ice. On average, the surface temperature of Pluto is -229c, which means that water ice will Hard and fragile. On the other hand, nitrogen is like water ice on Earth at this temperature, meaning it can Flowing like a glacier. This can be seen especially at the edges, as glaciers flow into the gap Around craters and mountains. The ice sheet itself has the shape of a huge polygonal entire area. There is also no crater, which means it must be a relatively new feature or function Continuously updated. It may only be 10 million years old. Polygonal cells show ridges above them most likely caused by sublimation A piece of ice turned directly into a gas. Although uncertain, the satellite Planitia may have been formed by influence, And ice blocks fill the ocean with the potential of a crater underground liquid ocean. This filled basin is actually a positive gravitational anomaly. Gravitational anomalies are places where gravity is different at some point object. The ice field is facing Charon and it will align with the object Tidal axis. Due to the short distance between Pluto and Pluto, Charon, the tidal effect of the two is very strong Object. This may be the cause of Pluto's tide locked to Charon and the two objects cannot Stay away from each other. Around the ice field is a vast mountain range made of water ice when observing From the side, it looks spectacular. Water ice is the only ice detected with enough power on Pluto An altitude of several kilometers at this temperature. There may also be some frozen volcanoes among the mountains found on Pluto, One of the most likely candidates is Wright Mons. It is 4 kilometers high and is one of the highest peaks on Pluto, and a Great Depression was discovered center. Frozen volcanoes may be a contributing factor to Pluto's young surface. Another obvious feature of Pluto is the material that darkness seems to sprinkle on The surface of certain areas. The largest area is called Cthulhu Macula. Strangely, it is reminiscent of the shape of a whale, as can be seen in the figure. Dark colors are thought to be sediments tholins, a tar composed of hydrocarbons Those who interact with sunlight. A similar sedimentary satellite, Iapetus, can be seen on one of Saturn, so this process has been seen Elsewhere in the solar system. The area on Pluto falls more severely than the heart, which means the surface There are more old people. In the middle you can see the mountain Cthulhu Macula, full of thought It's methane ice. The methane condenses to the height of frost Pluto. The last surface feature I will mention here is Tartarus Dorsa. This is an extensive, highly unique 500-meter-high mountain, similar to Snake or tree bark. They are considered Penitentes. If this is true, Pluto is the only place our solar system other than Earth Has been observed. They are very rare even on Earth, but some can be found in the Atacama Desert and elsewhere Dry high altitude areas. Those on Pluto are taller and cover a wider area than Earth. We can only imagine how close they look. For me, the most impressive discovery New Horizons can confirm this Pluto has an atmosphere. Not only that, the images are incredible. Due to Pluto's small size and weak gravity, the atmosphere seems to extend high The surface of Pluto. The atmosphere of the earth, while more compared to Pluto, huge and dense, hugging Planets are closer and more powerful than gravity. Pluto \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pressure is very high. However, about 10 Weibo, or 100,000 -1,000,000 times weaker than the surface. Theoretically, the pressure may increase up to 18 to 280 mbar three times Martian surface pressure and a quarter of Earth's surface pressure, if temperature Is the process of rising, the surface ice will sublime into the gas, we have seen On the ice field. The last time Pluto was thought to have this atmospheric density was 900,000 years ago. At this pressure and temperature, conditions may even be suitable for liquid nitrogen Formed on the surface of Pluto. Some evidence can be found here that seems to be a frozen lake. Anyway, within one year, the density of Pluto's atmosphere can double Fourth is due to seasonal changes. Compared to others, this is a huge contrast solar system object with atmosphere Generally fairly consistent. The atmosphere consists of the same ice condensing on the surface, namely nitrogen, Methane and carbon monoxide. Another fascinating discovery of new horizons about the atmosphere is that it has risen To 20 haze layers. The haze layer itself is not unexpected, but their number is. Some of them can be clearly seen in the image and behave like a thin layer fog. You can see the sunlight passing through this layer in this photo, the shadow comes from In contrast, the mountains' sunlight shines through the haze. These layers do not seem to have a horizontal planet. Here you can see this haze layer above the upper surface, but on this side of the image It touches the surface. On the other hand, to me, these are the most breathtaking pictures of Pluto, which I deliberately save They are until the end. You can really appreciate the mountains of depth and scale; Pluto almost seems Due to extreme terrain relief like a toy replica, but these mountains look so high Because Pluto is so small, its gravity is not strong enough to pull it down. This gives a diverse and impressive landscape as well as the fitting end of the video. Do you like what you saw today?

(Laughter) About 25 years ago, I was in my final year of medicine, but I doubted my choice of profession for some time. Then, one day, I went to take blood to a pretty old lady. I stabbed the artery instead of the vein. I still don't understand how I managed to do that. As blood spurted everywhere, I said to myself \"Yes, you definitely chose the wrong profession\". (Laughter) So for the benefit of all stakeholders, dropped out of college and became a yogi. (Laughter) (Applause) Hence my unconventional appearance. In fact, that's not the only reason for my unconventional appearance. One of many, so to speak. I would love to share with you the yogic concept of space, of our interior space, what we experience within ourselves - I'm redefining the terms here - and outer space, everything beyond us. We live in a huge universe. Let me show you his size, if we were to assume that the universe was the size of our planet Earth, then the size of our planet Earth would be a billionth in comparison heads of pins. The billionth part of one of these. I'm holding a pie, in case you can't see. That's my props. (Laughter) You see. This is it. In fact, it is identical to the pins. The billions of part of this compared to this. By the way, the billionth part of the pile is about a billionth of a grain of sand, that is, the average size of the atom, so choose. In any case, the idea is that it is very, very small compared to the size of the universe. Does this help put you in perspective? I think this gives us an idea of \u200b\u200bthe size of the universe. We were expected to believe that an incredibly large and complex universe, according to the discoveries of modern science, emerged from nothing with no prior intention. It's about as if we're expected to believe that our phones and laptops were simply created, without anyone having previously designed or assembled them. According to biologist Rupert Sheldrake \"Modern science is based on the principle, 'Give us one free miracle, and we'll explain the rest' (Laughter) \"And one free miracle is the phenomenon the entire mass and energy of the universe and all the laws that govern it, out of nothing, at once. However, only now is modern science comes to the conclusions, which have existed in the yogic tradition for thousands of years, to the explanation of our universe, that will raise our understanding to a higher level, which is that the content and purpose of the universe they originate from a deeper reality than material reality which we usually perceive through our mind and senses. And that reality is awareness. An all-pervading, blissful awareness, contained in each and everything. Just as your awareness is the essence of your mind, so is cosmic consciousness the essence of the entire universe. It exists within everything, and everything exists within it. Basically, everyone is and is all part of the consciousness and is filled with it. Imagine that. Either way, we are, for reasons I will not mention now, largely abandoned the idea of \u200b\u200bhigher awareness in our modern worldview. In the last 100 or so years, modern science has taken a very mechanistic view of the nature of reality. Still, what if they were mind, matter and space filled with consciousness? What if there is a possibility that consciousness is a higher reality, in which every part of it is equally real as our present construction of reality? And what if he could allow us, only if we were open to it, some real benefits in understanding our world, and how we fit into it, versus some very serious drawbacks materialistic worldview? The materialistic view to the universe as arbitrary, mechanistic, and insensitive, gives us every reason to feel alienated, lonely, scared and depressed. And if we don't feel that way, all too often we see this in others, and in the general weakness of our society. Materialism does not encourage optimism in people or society. On the other hand, in a blissfully conscious universe, there is every reason to feel intrinsically connected to people and to the world, to feel loved, happy, and at peace with ourselves and with others. According to my guru Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, \"You are never alone or helpless. A force that directs the stars, directs you, too. \" So instead of trying to get confirmation of the worldview that makes us sad and scared for the future, i believe we should try to get confirmation look at a world that gives us a sense of fulfillment and hope for the future, not just us as individuals, but us as societies. The benefits of seeing the world as awareness are immeasurable. And potentially no less justified from any of our constructions of reality. This is not mere fantasy. In fact, that the essence of the Universe is consciousness, the premise is equally justified such as that by which matter is the essence of the universe. The only difference is that one can be perceived, while the other cannot. We can perceive matter through our mind, as well as scientific measurements, but consciousness can only be experienced within ourselves. We need to find it within ourselves. There was once a Sufi mystic named Nasr Utem. I even stayed for a few days in his hometown in Turkey. And there are many legends about teaching in an eccentric and humorous way. In one of these stories, he lost his house keys, and went looking for them one night outside, under the lights of a street lamp. The passerby asked him what he was doing, \"I'm looking for house keys.\" \u201cWhere did you lose them?\u201d She asked him. \"Somewhere in the house.\" Of course, she said then: \"So if you lost them in the house, why are you looking for them outside?\" \"Because it's dark inside,\" he replied. (Laughter) We need to look for what we need in the right place. Even if it's hard to search there. It's easy to look outside, but not so easy to look inside. According to the teachings of yoga, consciousness lies within us, and that's where we have to look for it, But. the trick is that we cannot find her by intellect. It is not something we can grasp with our mind. Take the bulb case, say. A light bulb can light a room but not the electricity that allows it to glow. Likewise, we can understand the world around us, but not the awareness that brings us to life. It is beyond the normal functioning of the mind, beyond words, even beyond thought alone. The essence of our being is not something what can be talked about or thought about. I think everyone knows Descartes' saying, \"I mean, then I am.\" But what the yogic philosophy says is: \"When I stop thinking, then I really am.\" (Laughter) Just because we can't think of anything, just because we can't prove something scientifically, does not mean it does not exist. We cannot prove a mother's love for her child but that doesn't mean it's gone. It's a question of the heart, and the questions of the heart cannot be grasped by the mind. Thus material science can never penetrate into substance what it really means to be human. We can only confirm the essence of our existence through the deepest inner experience of consciousness. Now you may think that this is all a bit unrealistic and New Age. Even I am beginning to think so. (Laughter) So I'll give you some examples of scientists confirmed by the likelihood that awareness is a higher reality. Not many. But there are some who are quite prominent. I'm not going to dwell on this much, in fact, I'll try to finish before I start. (Laughter) Max Planck, founder of quantum theory; he believed that awareness was fundamental. \"I appreciate that matter is derived from consciousness. We cannot ignore awareness. Everything we talk about, everything that exists implies awareness, \" this was said by the originator of quantum theory. A little later, physicist James Jeans wrote: \"The flow of knowledge going in the direction of non-mechanical reality. The universe is starting to look more like one big thought, but like a big machine. \" And I better insert something from Einstein here just to spice it up a bit. (Laughter) \"The most beautiful and deepest emotion that we can experience is the experience of the mystical. This is the root of true science. That deeply emotional conviction on the presence of superior reasoning power which is discovered in an incomprehensible universe my idea is God. \" Lastly, I'll give you an example of a modern scientist who actually experienced higher consciousness firsthand. Dr. Eben Alexander is a neurologist who, like many of his colleagues had the idea that the brain was creating its own consciousness. Then it's a bit ironic, got a very rare brain infection that caused him to be in a coma for a week when he experienced an elevated and enlightened state of consciousness, despite the fact that he was clinically dead at the time. He said: \"While I was in a coma for seven days, not only did I remain fully aware but I was traveling to a stunning world beauty and peace and unconditional love. I have had the most amazing experience in my life, in which my consciousness traveled to a higher plane. \" Dr. Alexander is on a mission now to convince the neurologist community that, as he says, \"finish kindergarten\" and to abandon the idea that the brain creates its own consciousness \" Now, lucky for you and me, except for examples like this, there is a systematic and scientific method confirmation of the existence of consciousness in our daily lives. I don't think you'll be surprised to tell you that it will be meditation. Meditation is an intuitive science where awareness is affirmed pure first-hand inner experience. By meditation it is quite possible to experience higher awareness which is as real as you and I are sitting in this room right now. I once experienced a particularly enlightening meditation experience when I felt the whole room was filled with a field of awareness which vibrates with consciousness and bliss. It was so intense, so tangible. The feeling I had at the time could have been cut with a knife. It was undeniably real and to this day I have no doubt about it. During meditation, one has many such experiences which ultimately lead to self-awareness. Why don't we go there immediately and do we not try to experience higher awareness through meditation? Shall we try? It may not have occurred to you when you woke up this morning, that you will meditate today, but here you are, everything is possible. I urge you to close your eyes for a minute. Remember to breathe, and try not to fall asleep, I know, you had a hard day. And start centering yourself. Focus on your sense of self. Feel the center within you. (Music is heard) Feel that you are completely calm. Feel the peace and happiness all around you. Feel endless happiness everywhere. Now make sense of how you merge with that endless happiness. Feel how your sense of awareness blends in with endless awareness around you. Feel your consciousness merges with the endless awareness around you. Feel yourself becoming one with her. Feel that you are one with her. Feel that you are, and stay there for a few more seconds. Now, do you feel better? Dada Gunamuktananda: Yes? No? (Audience) Yes. In any case, you may have gained insight into the possibility that is your awareness one with the consciousness of the entire universe. That it is equally within and around you. That it is real, and that you can feel it, if you really try. And not only do you feel it, but you know that it is at the very core of your being. That this is not just an abstract concept, but the very essence of each of us. It\u2019s about discovering more awareness in our consciousness, the realization that our inner reality is a higher universal reality. And the more we expand our sense of reality, our sense of being, we will feel more connected to all beings. The happier we are, the less timid, less lonely, because we understand that everything is part of ourselves, that we are part of everything. Inner search helps us accept everything within ourselves, all humans, animals, plants ... The planet. Humans, animals and plants on other planets - yes, that's quite clear - the whole universe. What I like to say is that just as the world becomes a smaller place, with the development of communications and transportation technologies, so will the universe become a smaller place with the development of meditation technology. [Cosmic consciousness rests in our sense of existence in the very desire of the heart. \"Shrii Shrii Anandamurti] Thank you. (Applause)", "PKfR6bAXr-c": "what did you learn Longevity and why I eat once a day. Nutrition and our hybrid body In 1950, my friend Bill was a very talented engineer who made an extraordinary car The primary fuel of the car was electricity, and gasoline was placed when available. It was OK to use gasoline every two days or more, but the problem was That people kept it on gasoline almost 90% of the time. This caused the car to break down frequently, while Bell was trying to tell people \"Use it the way it was designed!\" Despite his advice, people continued to develop theories about how to use the car correctly. Bell went bankrupt and left the car industry shortly after. This dilemma in which my imaginary poor friend Bill found himself quite similar Our modern healthy environment How has eating become so complicated? Most of us just want to feel good, look good and live a long life. You would have believed that by this time there should be a clear consensus on what to eat in our eating habits You look like it, but we're facing a myriad of ideas on this topic. Maybe we should follow the ABC diet or XYZ diet or something in between? One of the first diets was proposed by a man named George Chain in 1724. Now, on Amazon you can find over 50,000 different books on this topic. Like a Bell car, there is definitely a simple way to nourish our bodies Most suitable for its design. Obviously we are not engineers, but Homo Sabian appeared about 200,000 years ago And most of the time, the nutritional environment cannot be the same as it is today Agriculture did not even exist for 190,000 years from that time. Not even the fruits and vegetables we had today were the same If we do not grow it according to our tastes. Only 700 years ago this was how the banana looked. So what is the way we eat? The environment was choosing our diet instead of us. Your options were to eat what was available or to be dead. The idea that our bodies have adapted to a certain percentage of the nutrients available in the amount In the environment is not new. And recently it has become well known because of \"Paleo Diet\". However, what I want to reach is that our body also had to adapt With when food is available - there should be a natural frequency of food time, be reinforced Health and longevity. where do I start? It stands to reason that more food and food will make you healthier and live longer. But let's take a look at this from the \"first principles\" method as Elon Musk described it: \"It is somewhat rationally easier to conclude by way of measurement rather than the first principles. The first principles are a kind of physics way of looking at the world. What this means is that things get back to the most basic facts And she says \"Okay, what are we sure about its authenticity? Then, you start from there. And that requires a lot of mental energy. \" So what do we know about longevity? Other than exercise, the word \"super foods\" may come to mind. Maybe more omega-3 or some red wine, or make sure that we take supplements and drink Less alcohol will make us live longer. There are a lot of things that contribute to longevity, but there is one way before it Science can be used to increase longevity steadily. \"If you take any organism on the planet from yeast cells to spiders, insects and rabbits And dogs ... and cut their caloric intake by 30%, they live 30% longer. The only organism that has not yet been carefully tested by scientists is Homo sapiens (modern man)! \" Let's start here. For a time, the conventional wisdom was that you needed to get 3 balanced meals A day to stay healthy. Since I was a child, \"breakfast, lunch and dinner\" were as natural as sleeping Or go to the bathroom. Breakfast was the most important meal of the day, and I needed a healthy lunch to focus The rest of the school day, and going to sleep without dinner was child abuse. The situation is the same in Japan where I live now As in the rest of the world If we want to reduce calories to increase life, the only option is to eat less For every meal, we need 3 meals, right? But where did the idea of \u200b\u200b3 meals come in today? As Abigail Carroll suggests in her book \"Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal\": He ate three meals a day that was invented mainly due to cultural reasons, when European settlers arrived in America They found the indigenous people ate food whenever they felt Desiring this, not at specific times. Europeans considered the absence of specific dates for eating as evidence that they were uncivilized And they changed them. In short: the three-meal model per day is not based on our biological needs. How our environment designed us. It was not surprising at all in the culture of hunting and gathering to eat a big catch, then live on very little or without any food For long periods of time until they need another great source of fat and protein. In fact, the environment so far suggests that if we hadn't been able to do that, Often we will not be alive to read about dieting. The Pirah\u00e3, a group of indigenous people in the Amazon jungle His study is widely recognized by an anthropological linguist named Daniel Evert. He found that they do not eat every day or even try to do so. They were even familiar with food storage techniques but they never used them except for bartering Brazilian merchants. When asked why they did not store food for themselves, they explained, \"I am storing Meat in my brother's belly. \" Until the advent of agriculture, eat 3 meals a day, in some cases even eating Every day was almost impossible. Some of you may indicate that the average life expectancy is in the Stone Age It was much less than it is now i.e. about 33 years old, as evidence that modern eating habits more healthy. However, the infant mortality rate was a major factor in reducing this number. You have to understand that one of the effects of modern civilization and technology is that it is You can either not be resourceful or your genetic material weak and not die. As Doug McGough explains about life expectancy at the time: \"It was not a relationship A catabolic anabolic balance or long-term health benefits due to presence Elderly survivors and fossil evidence from these survivors are shown on the basis of ligaments And the evaluation of the bone and bone mineral density indicates that they were very strong. \" Glucose metabolism and how \"conventional wisdom\" has harmed us A common misconception is that blood sugar stability is essential to survival Which biologically justifies the three meals a day. Take a little biochemistry with me to understand why you consume carbohydrates constantly To maintain the blood sugar level is not only unnecessary but it can be a harmful and vicious cycle. So, after you've eaten some carbohydrates - bread, pasta, and candy, whatever. Glucose enters the bloodstream and produces insulin to properly distribute glucose. By means of insulin receptors, glucose enters cells to produce energy. This can only happen at a certain rate, so to avoid cell or glucose flooding Glucose remaining in the bloodstream, 70 grams can be stored in the liver and 200 grams in the muscles. So when you eat bread in the morning and some coffee - \"What do you want, some vanilla nonsense Latte and coffee drink, anything you have, I don't care. \"It stores all Glucose that you can store. So he has to go to your body fat. In addition to storing it as energy, your body places it in your body fat because the fat cells It has less complex mechanisms than other cells. Too much glucose can bind to proteins and block the mechanism of cells in A harmful inflammatory process called glycation. It's like pouring a sweet drink into a motor car. The problem here is that if your own energy levels decrease, you cannot utilize the energy In your body\u2019s fat stores because the hormone responsible for this - the sensitive lipase hormone is Insulin sensitive. Insulin will not allow you to take advantage of body fat for energy. If you have too much insulin in your bloodstream as a result of treating too much glucose Before and now you need energy, you will feel very hungry, and you will need to be raised Short-term blood sugar through a snack or something to lift your energy levels again. This is why if you follow the recommended American diet, it will often be Stuck in this episode of wanting to eat every time you have low blood glucose Three meals a day will seem very necessary. Even doctor Peter Atia fell victim to this: \"Despite exercising 3 or 4 hours Every day and literally following the food pyramid, I gained a lot of weight And I have something called \"metabolic syndrome\" Ketosis rescue If you stop taking glucose for 10 to 12 hours, You will run out of glucose stores and your body will start to break down fat The liver can produce what are called ketone bodies. Ketogenic bodies produce energy for the body's cells via glucose-like pathways But it is more stable and efficient and does not cause complications like those we talked about. You may have heard of the ketosis condition referred to as \"starvation status\" in school, however This does not in any way suggest that you were about to starve. I don't particularly like this term because it indicates that glucose / carbohydrates Is the primary fuel source for the body, While it is possible to live completely without carbohydrates. \"Humans don't have any need for carbohydrates. Not even a single gram. We have this wonderful liver that produces glucose whenever you need it. \" Example: A 456-year-old man in Scotland fasted for 382 days He only consumed water and vitamin supplements. He lost 276 lbs and continued fasting with no bad effects. Technically he was in \"starvation mode\" all this time and his body was being used His body stores fat for energy. A quick note: ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis are not the same. Several years ago, when I first heard about low-carb diets, I was honestly skeptical When I heard that my best friend's mother was trying the Atkins diet, I was worried about her. However, after understanding the biochemistry behind it, I started following the Paleo diet. \" Overall I felt great, my fitness was better with less effort and much more stable energy levels The downside is that i was annoying planning meals so much, so i was Cheat a lot from time to time. The benefits of fasting Even after people have been in environments where She can eat many more times, the concept of fasting persists for its health benefits For some time. There is an inscription in an Egyptian pyramid from about 3800 BC stating the following: \"Humans live on a quarter What they eat. On the other three quarters the doctor lives. \" Plato appears to have fasted for mental efficiency, and \"Luther of Medicine\" Phillips Paracelsus said about fasting \u201cthe greatest remedy,\u201d and Mark Twain suggested that fasting More effective than any drug. Even the Romans found that they could heal people who were worn by demons Being locked in a room without food. Fasting and aging. To simplify an incredibly complex process, aging in substance is the result of an accumulation Damage to your DNA. Professor of Genetics, David Sinclair and his team found that non-eating stimulates Sirtuin proteins that are directly responsible for repairing the DNA. It is classified as a key factor in longevity. Neuroscience professor Mark Matson, at Johns Hopkins University showed How fasting stimulates the growth of new nerve cells in the brain. This explains why fasting has been associated with the prevention of neurological diseases Such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. This information made me enthusiastic about intermittent fasting. With intermittent fasting do not eat for 16 hours a day that gives your body Time to deplete your glucose stores and start burning fat And also reap the benefits discussed above. Many sources indicate that the main factor here is whether you are following a long fast Intermittent fasting or simply eating less, you give your body a chance Glucose stores are depleted, and ketosis begins, resulting in the discussed health benefits. I was aware of the fact that it is possible to get similar effects from the Paleo diet with more freedom in my diet. The problem with intermittent fasting was that I found myself craving food outside Eight hours, and I still have to be somewhat strict with what I eat Although it is not as strict as the three-meal system per day. Upton Sinclair, who was born in the late 1800s and lived long until the nineteen years of age, He published a book in 1911 entitled \"Fasting is a cure.\" The book was inspired by the personal experiences of 250 people cured some diseases across Prolonged fasting. Diseases range from colds, headaches, constipation to arthritis, Valvular heart disease and cancer. Dr. Alan Goldmer talked about how, in 2012, a 42-year-old patient had recovered from cancer (stage Third of lymphoma) by fasting for 21 days. All this made me try my first week in the long fast ... but I stopped on the fourth day Although I did not feel bad. While I missed my goal and didn't feel much different after that, After several days, I started to notice something. I used to eat some refined sugar from time to time, but after fasting I was not interested. It was like remodeling my taste in food. Meanwhile, I discovered a book called \"Kuufuku ga hito o kenkou ni suru\". Written by Dr. Yoshinori Nagumo. The title means \"Hunger makes people healthy.\" It provides an incredibly convincing argument to challenge yourself with one meal per day. The book covered many of the things that I talked about here, and some things that I did not do Some of my concerns were dispelled like malnutrition. Also, it was easy to trust him as he is 30 years older than me and looks younger I decided to try to eat once a day for two weeks. For 3 weeks before starting, I used to give my sister a little bit around Tokyo I was eating anything and everything looked good. It started with Nagumo the next day you left and the first three days were definitely the hardest. When it was around 11 a.m., I realized that I am not getting pleasure from the usual food On them at this time of day and felt very eager to eat. My stomach wasn't really painful, it was equivalent to not being able to play With video games after returning from school. At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was convinced that I was really hungry and needed to eat. Waiting another 30 minutes until four thirty was like the last batch of squatting exercises. The next two days were a little easier, and on the fourth day I noticed that I was no longer looking at time and thinking \"Oh ... only four hours for food!\" After a week, I decided to test the diet by riding a bike for fifty kilometers Atsugi from Tokyo. I didn't exercise much and my usual bike ride was about 3 km. Unsurprisingly, it was difficult, but I didn't feel my physical weakness. I felt the pain of hunger earlier than usual, but I didn't feel like I was less powerful than Lack of food. This made me stick to eating once a day. It's been a month since I started and feel great overall My energy levels are very stable, I feel more focused and curiously I have fewer problems with hunger compared With intermittent fasting. Even if I don't eat a healthy meal I can now feel confident that my body is He has more time to get rid of excess glucose or the toxins that you have eaten. The only time I crave unhealthy food is when I have had some alcohol. Looking back, it's hard to imagine a lot of food piling up in my stomach all day long. In addition to health benefits, another reason to do this is the same reason that Steve was Jobs wears the same thing every day: it makes choosing easier It frees my mind to focus on other things. At least for me, the amount of new information I get is a small factor in my behavior change For example, if my knowledge of alcohol harms increases, for example, by 60% Maybe I will cut my consumption by 30%. With this article alone, I do not expect you to suddenly start eating once a day, But I hope you start by giving your body a break and eating when you need it, Not when the watch says you should. If you like the video, be sure to subscribe. I try my best to make at least a new video every two weeks so stay tuned. You can see the latest video here.", "s86-Z-CbaHA": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. There's a famous way to seemingly create chocolate out of nothing. Maybe you've seen it before. This chocolate bar is 4 squares by 8 squares, but if you cut it like this and then like this and finally like this you can rearrange the pieces like so and wind up with the same 4 by 8 bar but with a leftover piece, apparently created out of thin air. There's a popular animation of this illusion as well. I call it an illusion because it's just that. Fake. In reality, the final bar is a bit smaller. It contains this much less chocolate. Each square along the cut is shorter than it was in the original, but the cut makes it difficult to notice right away. The animation is extra misleading, because it tries to cover up its deception. The lost height of each square is surreptitiously added in while the piece moves to make it hard to notice. I mean, come on, obviously you cannot cut up a chocolate bar and rearrange the pieces into more than you started with. Or can you? One of the strangest theorems in modern mathematics is the Banach-Tarski paradox. It proves that there is, in fact, a way to take an object and separate it into 5 different pieces. And then, with those five pieces, simply rearrange them. No stretching required into two exact copies of the original item. Same density, same size, same everything. Seriously. To dive into the mind blow that it is and the way it fundamentally questions math and ourselves, we have to start by asking a few questions. First, what is infinity? A number? I mean, it's nowhere on the number line, but we often say things like there\\'s an infinite \"number\" of blah-blah-blah. And as far as we know, infinity could be real. The universe may be infinite in size and flat, extending out for ever and ever without end, beyond even the part we can observe or ever hope to observe. That's exactly what infinity is. Not a number per se, but rather a size. The size of something that doesn't end. Infinity is not the biggest number, instead, it is how many numbers there are. But there are different sizes of infinity. The smallest type of infinity is countable infinity. The number of hours in forever. It's also the number of whole numbers that there are, natural number,  the numbers we use when counting things, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on. Sets like these are unending, but they are countable. Countable means that you can count them from one element to any other in a finite amount of time, even if that finite amount of time is longer than you will live or the universe will exist for, it's still finite. Uncountable infinity, on the other hand, is literally bigger. Too big to even count. The number of real numbers that there are, not just whole numbers, but all numbers is uncountably infinite. You literally cannot count even from 0 to 1 in a finite amount of time by naming every real number in between. I mean, where do you even start? Zero, okay. But what comes next? 0.000000... Eventually, we would imagine a 1 going somewhere at the end, but there is no end. We could always add another 0. Uncountability makes this set so much larger than the set of all whole numbers that even between 0 and 1, there are more numbers than there are whole numbers on the entire endless number line. Georg Cantor's famous diagonal argument helps illustrate this. Imagine listing every number between zero and one. Since they are uncountable and can't be listed in order, let's imagine randomly generating them forever with no repeats. Each number regenerate can be paired with a whole number. If there's a one to one correspondence between the two, that is if we can match one whole number to each real number on our list, that would mean that countable and uncountable sets are the same size. But we can't do that, even though this list goes on for ever. Forever isn't enough. Watch this. If we go diagonally down our endless list of real numbers and take the first decimal of the first number and the second of the second number, the third of the third and so on and add one to each, subtracting one if it happens to be a nine, we can generate a new real number that is obviously between 0 and 1, but since we've defined it to be different from every number on our endless list and at least one place it's clearly not contained in the list. In other words, we've used up every single whole number, the entire infinity of them and yet we can still come up with more real numbers. Here's something else that is true but counter-intuitive. There are the same number of even numbers as there are even and odd numbers. At first, that sounds ridiculous. Clearly, there are only half as many even numbers as all whole numbers, but that intuition is wrong. The set of all whole numbers is denser but every even number can be matched with a whole number. You will never run out of members either set, so this one to one correspondence shows that both sets are the same size. In other words, infinity divided by two is still infinity. Infinity plus one is also infinity. A good illustration of this is Hilbert's paradox up the Grand Hotel. Imagine a hotel with a countably infinite number of rooms. But now, imagine that there is a person booked into every single room. Seemingly, it's fully booked, right? No. Infinite sets go against common sense. You see, if a new guest shows up and wants a room, all the hotel has to do is move the guest in room number 1 to room number 2. And a guest in room 2 to room 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 and so on. Because the number of rooms is never ending we cannot run out of rooms. Infinity -1 is also infinity again. If one guest leaves the hotel, we can shift every guest the other way. Guest 2 goes to room 1, 3 to 2, 4 to 3 and so on, because we have an infinite amount of guests. That is a never ending supply of them. No room will be left empty. As it turns out, you can subtract any finite number from infinity and still be left with infinity. It doesn't care. It's unending. Banach-Tarski hasn't left our sights yet. All of this is related. We are now ready to move on to shapes. Hilbert's hotel can be applied to a circle. Points around the circumference can be thought of as guests. If we remove one point from the circle that point is gone, right? Infinity tells us it doesn't matter. The circumference of a circle is irrational. It's the radius times 2Pi. So, if we mark off points beginning from the whole, every radius length along the circumference going clockwise we will never land on the same point twice, ever. We can count off each point we mark with a whole number. So this set is never-ending, but countable, just like guests and rooms in Hilbert's hotel. And like those guests, even though one has checked out, we can just shift the rest. Move them counterclockwise and every room will be filled Point 1 moves to fill in the hole, point 2 fills in the place where point 1 used to be, 3 fills in 2 and so on. Since we have a unending supply of numbered points, no hole will be left unfilled. The missing point is forgotten. We apparently never needed it to be complete. There's one last needo consequence of infinity we should discuss before tackling Banach-Tarski. Ian Stewart famously proposed a brilliant dictionary. One that he called the Hyperwebster. The Hyperwebster lists every single possible word of any length formed from the 26 letters in the English alphabet. It begins with \"a,\" followed by \"aa,\" then \"aaa,\" then \"aaaa.\" And after an infinite number of those, \"ab,\" then \"aba,\" then \"abaa\", \"abaaa,\" and so on until \"z, \"za,\" \"zaa,\" et cetera, et cetera, until the final entry in infinite sequence of \"z\"s. Such a dictionary would contain every single word. Every single thought, definition, description, truth, lie, name, story. What happened to Amelia Earhart would be in that dictionary, as well as every single thing that didn't happened to Amelia Earhart. Everything that could be said using our alphabet. Obviously, it would be huge, but the company publishing it might realize that they could take a shortcut. If they put all the words that begin with a in a volume titled \"A,\" they wouldn\\'t have to print the initial \"a.\" Readers would know to just add the \"a,\" because it\\'s the \"a\" volume. By removing the initial \"a,\" the publisher is left with every \"a\" word sans the first \"a,\" which has surprisingly become every possible word. Just one of the 26 volumes has been decomposed into the entire thing. It is now that we're ready to investigate this video's titular paradox. What if we turned an object, a 3D thing into a Hyperwebster? Could we decompose pieces of it into the whole thing? Yes. The first thing we need to do is give every single point on the surface of the sphere one name and one name only. A good way to do this is to name them after how they can be reached by a given starting point. If we move this starting point across the surface of the sphere in steps that are just the right length, no matter how many times or in what direction we rotate, so long as we never backtrack, it will never wind up in the same place twice. We only need to rotate in four directions to achieve this paradox. Up, down, left and right around two perpendicular axes. We are going to need every single possible sequence that can be made of any finite length out of just these four rotations. That means we will need lef, right, up and down as well as left left, left up, left down, but of course not left right, because, well, that's backtracking. Going left and then right means you're the same as you were before you did anything, so no left rights, no right lefts and no up downs and no down ups. Also notice that I'm writing the rotations in order right to left, so the final rotation is the leftmost letter. That will be important later on. Anyway. A list of all possible sequences of allowed rotations that are finite in lenght is, well, huge. Countably infinite, in fact. But if we apply each one of them to a starting point in green here and then name the point we land on after the sequence that brought us there, we can name a countably infinite set of points on the surface. Let's look at how, say, these four strings on our list would work. Right up left. Okay, rotating the starting point this way takes us here. Let's colour code the point based on the final rotation in its string, in this case it's left and for that we will use purple. Next up down down. That sequence takes us here. We name the point DD and color it blue, since we ended with a down rotation. RDR, that will be this point's name, takes us here. And for a final right rotation, let's use red. Finally, for a sequence that end with up, let's colour code the point orange. Now, if we imagine completing this process for every single sequence, we will have a countably infinite number of points named and color-coded. That's great, but not enough. There are an uncountably infinite number of points on a sphere's surface. But no worries, we can just pick a point we missed. Any point and color it green, making it a new starting point and then run every sequence from here. After doing this to an uncountably infinite number of starting point we will have indeed named and colored every single point on the surface just once. With the exception of poles. Every sequence has two poles of rotation. Locations on the sphere that come back to exactly where they started. For any sequence of right or left rotations, the polls are the north and south poles. The problem with poles like these is that more than one sequence can lead us to them. They can be named more than once and be colored in more than one color. For example, if you follow some other sequence to the north or south pole, any subsequent rights or lefts will be equally valid names. In order to deal with this we're going to just count them out of the normal scheme and color them all yellow. Every sequence has two, so there are a countably infinite amount of them. Now, with every point on the sphere given just one name and just one of six colors, we are ready to take the entire sphere apart. Every point on the surface corresponds to a unique line of points below it all the way to the center point. And we will be dragging every point's line along with it. The lone center point we will set aside. Okay, first we cut out and extract all the yellow poles, the green starting points, the orange up points, the blue down points and the red and purple left and right points. That's the entire sphere. With just these pieces you could build the whole thing. But take a look at the left piece. It is defined by being a piece composed of every point, accessed via a sequence ending with a left rotation. If we rotate this piece right, that\\'s the same as adding an \"R\" to every point's name. But left and then right is a backtrack, they cancel each other out. And look what happens when you reduce them away. The set becomes the same as a set of all points with names that end with L, but also U, D and every point reached with no rotation. That's the full set of starting points. We have turned less than a quarter of the sphere into nearly three-quarters just by rotating it. We added nothing. It's like the Hyperwebster. If we had the right piece and the poles of rotation and the center point, well, we've got the entire sphere again, but with stuff left over. To make a second copy, let's rotate the up piece down. The down ups cancel because, well, it's the same as going nowhere and we're left with a set of all starting points, the entire up piece, the right piece and the left piece, but there's a problem here. We don't need this extra set of starting points. We still haven't used the original ones. No worries, let's just start over. We can just move everything from the up piece that turns into a starting point when rotated down. That means every point whose final rotation is up. Let's put them in the piece. Of course, after rotating points named UU will just turn into points named U, and that would give us a copy here and here. So, as it turns out, we need to move all points with any name that is just a string of Us. We will put them in the down piece and rotate the up piece down, which makes it congruent to the up right and left pieces, add in the down piece along with some up and the starting point piece and, well, we're almost done. The poles of rotation and center are missing from this copy, but no worries. There's a countably infinite number of holes, where the poles of rotations used to be, which means there is some pole around which we can rotate this sphere such that every pole hole orbits around without hitting another. Well, this is just a bunch of circles with one point missing. We fill them each like we did earlier. And we do the same for the centerpoint. Imagine a circle that contains it inside the sphere and just fill in from infinity and look what we've done. We have taken one sphere and turned it into two identical spheres without adding anything. One plus one equals 1. That took a while to go through, but the implications are huge. And mathematicians, scientists and philosophers are still debating them. Could such a process happen in the real world? I mean, it can happen mathematically and math allows us to abstractly predict and describe a lot of things in the real world with amazing accuracy, but does the Banach-Tarski paradox take it too far? Is it a place where math and physics separate? We still don't know. History is full of examples of mathematical concepts developed in the abstract that we did not think would ever apply to the real world for years, decades, centuries, until eventually science caught up and realized they were totally applicable and useful. The Banach-Tarski paradox could actually happen in our real-world, the only catch of course is that the five pieces you cut your object into aren't simple shapes. They must be infinitely complex and detailed. That's not possible to do in the real world, where measurements can only get so small and there's only a finite amount of time to do anything, but math says it's theoretically valid and some scientists think it may be physically valid too. There have been a number of papers published suggesting a link between by Banach-Tarski and the way tiny tiny sub-atomic particles can collide at high energies and turn into more particles than we began with. We are finite creatures. Our lives are small and can only scientifically consider a small part of reality. What's common for us is just a sliver of what's available. We can only see so much of the electromagnetic spectrum. We can only delve so deep into extensions of space. Common sense applies to that which we can access. But common sense is just that. Common. If total sense is what we want, we should be prepared to accept that we shouldn't call infinity weird or strange. The results we've arrived at by accepting it are valid, true within the system we use to understand, measure, predict and order the universe. Perhaps the system still needs perfecting, but at the end of day, history continues to show us that the universe isn't strange. We are. And as always, thanks for watching. Finally, as always, the description is full of links to learn more. There are also a number of books linked down there that really helped me wrap my mind kinda around Banach-Tarski. First of all, Leonard Wapner\\'s \"The Pea and the Sun.\" This book is fantastic and it\\'s full of lot of the preliminaries needed to understand the proof that comes later. He also talks a lot about the ramifications of what Banach-Tarski and their theorem might mean for mathematics. Also, if you wanna talk about math and whether it's discovered or invented, whether it really truly will map onto the universe, Yanofsky's \"The Outer Limits of Reason\" is great. This is the favorite book of mine that I've read this entire year. Another good one is E. Brian Davies' \"Why Beliefs Matter.\" This is actually Corn\\'s favorite book, as you might be able to see there. It's delicious and full of lots of great information about the limits of what we can know and what science is and what mathematics is. If you love infinity and math, I cannot more highly recommend Matt Parker's \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension.\" He\\'s hilarious and this book is very very great at explaining some pretty awesome things. So keep reading, and if you're looking for something to watch, I hope you've already watched Kevin Lieber's film on Field Day. I already did a documentary about Whittier, Alaska over there. Kevin's got a great short film about putting things out on the Internet and having people react to them. There's a rumor that Jake Roper might be doing something on Field Day soon. So check out mine, check out Kevin's and subscribe to Field Day for upcoming Jake Roper action, yeah? He's actually in this room right now, say hi, Jake. [Jake:] Hi. Thanks for filming this, by the way. Guys, I really appreciate who you all are. And as always, thanks for watching.", "p-MNSLsjjdo": "[music] This short story by Great Courses Plus provide A very strange test result That is a single particle Double-slit experiment It was a very surprising experiment, It demonstrates that the quantum world is very different The macro world we perceive intuitively. Our physical intuition. In fact, it contains the most essential natural phenomenon in our real world. It may not be physics in short, at least in any sense We are familiar. [Theme music] Let's start with the cognition we are familiar with Have a rubber duckling It goes up and down in the pool, causing periodic ripples Spread out Beyond a certain distance, these ripples encountered an obstacle This obstacle has two slits Most of the ripples were blocked, but some ripples passed through the fine seams. New ripples will overlap each other They produce this beautiful texture It is called \"interference texture\" That's because in some places, The crests of waves coming out of one seam overlap the crests of waves coming out of another Generated higher peaks. By the same token, a deeper trough We call it \"structural interference\" When one peak meets another, They cancel each other out and the water surface is flat. This is \"annihilation interference\" So we get waves that alternate with flat. Any type of wave will produce stripes similar to this. For example, water waves, sound waves Including light waves This double-slit interference phenomenon of light is first caused by Observed by Thomas Young in 1801. A beam of light passes through two very thin slits Alternating light and dark stripes Which means \"structural interference\" and \"annihilation interference\" Of course, we all know that light is actually An electromagnetic wave This recognition of light is attributed to Maxwell 100 years later. So is the perfect explanation of the electromagnetic wave? This interference fringe? But we also all know light Is an indivisible group The composition of electromagnetic energy, also known as \"photons\". Einstein proved this through the photoelectric effect. But his idea comes from Quantitative Energy of Max Brown's Blackbody Radiation Theory Watch our other videos to learn more about this part. it is good. Since each photon is a small wave of light Electromagnetic waves And each photon can no longer be split Which means that every photon Should either go through this slit, Either go through another thin seam. It must not be split in half and then merged on the other side. This thing was well explained There are two photons A photon goes through a slit Then two photons go through the fine slit Interfere with each other So this kind of interference fringes But here we get a very surprising test result. This interference fringe is always present Even if we only emit one photon at a time. Let's sort it out again. We first emit a photon, and the first photon is accurately detected Landed somewhere on the screen. So, emit the second, third, and fourth photons All fall into a certain position So this shows their particle characteristics, And there is precise position. But continue like this Launch one by one You will gradually observe this interference fringes appear again By the way Virtash is actually in his This experiment was performed in a series of double-slit experiments It is worth a look. This is really weird. This interference fringe Has nothing to do with how each photon's energy travels This is different from the transmission of water waves. Each photon releases all of its energy to one point on the screen at a time. However, the resulting interference fringes are caused by Many completely unrelated photons result. How did that happen? Each photon does not know where the previous photon landed on the screen I don't know where the next photon will fall. The area where the photon falls Areas most likely to be hit by photons And the area least likely to be hit by a photon Is the interference fringe we know, It resembles a wave through two thin seams. These photons will land on the screen in this pattern. Actually, it's not just Photon is like this One by one, electrons are fired at these slits. It also falls on the screen point by point Continuously emit electrons one by one The same type of interference fringes will eventually appear. This crazy phenomenon has been Found molecularly. C60 is composed of 60 carbon atoms Large molecule Also observed this Interference stripes in double-slit experiments We have to conclude that every photon, electron And C60 molecules are like waves at the same time Go through two fine seams. Then they interfere with themselves This forms such interference fringes. The highlights of the stripes are Where this particle has the highest probability Discover yourself. It looks like a probability wave Appear at some point, for some reason Make yourself appear somewhere Similar phenomenon in the quantum tunnel effect In fact some quantum properties, such as quantum momentum Quantum energy and rotation show this Wave characteristics. We describe this mathematically Wave-like characteristic called Wave function. Description of wave function It is the core of quantum mechanics. So what do these wave functions mean? What exactly are these waves? We return again to the results of the double-slit experiment. We can know where the examples come from and where they fall. It comes out of our laser gun or electron gun It landed somewhere on the screen So these particles have particle characteristics at the beginning and end Between the start and the end it is more like a wave. This wave contains this particle All information that may have fallen somewhere on the screen. And it \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s included throughout the journey. Somewhere at any stage. In fact, the wave must include this particle All possible paths. These all The path from the beginning to the end, After reaching the screen, land on the final destination That means choosing from these possible paths. So what is causing the transition between this wave Multiple possibilities and one clear thing At a specific point? At that mysterious starting point And the end point is this particle in this space Probability anywhere? it is good. We have added more questions. We still can't figure out what waves are. In fact, the answer is not known But various explanations are being tried for quantum mechanics. Let's talk about the most favored Presented by Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr They are in the 1920s. Pioneer in quantum mechanics at the University of Copenhagen. Copenhagen explained that the wave function There is no one physical property. Instead, it is a purely probabilistic event. It shows that in a double slit experiment All possible paths of the particles constitute a wave function A probability wave, this probability wave covers All possible paths. Only when particles are finally detected The location and path were finally determined. Copenhagen explains the shift From a probabilistic event to an established event Collapse for wave function It tells us that before the probability wave function collapses, It doesn't make sense to try to discuss the properties of a particle. It's like any possibility exists in the universe And these possibilities exist at the same time It wasn't until the last minute, which process was known. Weird, these different possible paths, These different possible realities, Communicate with each other. This interaction increases the chance of certain paths At the same time, the possibility of certain paths is reduced. That is, the interaction between possible realities. This is the distribution that appears in the final position That is interference pattern. This model is true, although the vast majority Production path never become true. Explained in Copenhagen, This last choice Is random And within the limits of this final wave function. Quantum mechanics theory can Precise predictions of reality And it is completely consistent with Copenhagen But Copenhagen is not the only explanation Some explanations give this wave function Physical meaning. Remember, we know that light is a wave in an electromagnetic field Quantum field theory tells us All elementary particles are waves in their field. This may give us a more physical medium Drive these probability waves. If you think the Copenhagen explanation is Very weird, check out our short \"Multiverse\" short story.

Let's take a look at some reviews From our vignette role In forming our solar system. Jason Blank asked: \"Is Jupiter almost a star?\" Well, the lowest mass star has about 7.5% mass The Sun, while Jupiter is 1 / 10,000 of the mass of solar energy. So it's not really all close. You need about 75 Jupiters stacked on top of each other Ignite the core of continuous integration. How many of you don't know why we think that even Jupiter Need to have a rock core. Well, the sun and other stars don't need rock cores Because they are huge enough to keep all the anger Crash itself. There is a minimum quality which is able to do this. This is what is called \"the quality of jeans.\" It depends on the size of the cloud, temperature, speed, And composition. For a typical interstellar cloud, the quality of jeans is a bit Smaller mass than the sun, but still too much, Much bigger than Jupiter. For Jupiter to form its gas giant, It requires a rock core to start the process. The core may have dissolved due to Jupiter forming first. Juno speaks out characters carefully Mapping Jupiter's gravity and magnetic field. Bike Jack will talk more like me Regarding the resonance frequency. My pleasure--a resonant frequency When two orbital mechanisms have orbital periods One of the small integers is neat. For example, for each of Jupiter's moons, Io, Its satellites Europa orbit twice Europa and Europa twice. For every eight Earth orbits, Venus makes 13. These integers are more than the maximum amount of time The planet spends its closest. When these institutions are closest together, They have the strongest gravity Pulling at each other they stop The resonance frequency from the deviation. Imposters complain that Jupiter's plot is like this Understandable. do not worry. We already have something hard to understand Really come to your way soon. [Theme music]", "onMbSLuC7Oc": "", "9HbvyV7ogAA": "", "Z0_Of0WGkEs": "the details that I'm about to share with you in this video are so fascinating that it's gonna make you rethink everything you thought you knew about the Sahara Desert and our lost ancient past because when we think of the Sahara Desert we picture an endless sea of sand dunes that stretch further than the eye can see located of course in the middle of a blistering hot desert that is larger than the entire continental United States but what we're just now learning is that the world's largest nonpolar desert is actually the widespread burial grounds of countless mysteriously unknown ancient ruins and civilizations that have long since been forgotten having been consumed and hidden by the sands of time thousands of years ago and here's the thing when I say thousands of years ago that's the part where things start to get really strange because it turns out that the most recent scientific evidence shows that the Sahara Desert is far younger than we ever thought in fact what scientists assumed was millions of years old we now know that as recently is just five thousand years ago the Sahara Desert was a lush green tropical paradise that spanned from Egypt to the Atlantic coast of the Western Sahara and contained the world's largest freshwater lakes ever known to have existed and not only that a massive network of rivers that made this entire region an oasis for ancient human civilizations thus explaining why in just the last few years we've been finding so many mysteriously unknown structures and what is now a remote barren wasteland and listen to this scientists that analyzed this recent data concluded that in as little as just 100 years the lush green tropical paradise that spanned thousands of miles across North Africa was mysteriously wiped out and transformed into what is now the world's largest hot desert think about that and as little as 100 years one century in other words something unbelievably radical happened here on earth and the not distant past to cause a complete swinging climate throughout such an enormous region and so quickly although I must say that estimates do vary with some scientists saying that it was more likely to be over the course of five centuries rather than one century but either way we are talking about an unbelievably short period of time so the big question becomes why did this happen well scientists from MIT believe that this shift in climate is related to a 20,000 year cycle and changes to the Earth's orbital tilt thus causing most of the Sahara to go back and forth from a desert to a jungle over and over again with the last shift occurring somewhere around 5,000 years ago now keep in mind that estimates vary on this as well with some specifically stating 5,000 years ago others stating 6000 years ago and there's even more broad estimates stating between 4,500 and 8,000 years ago with others even stating dates as far back as 10,000 and 11,000 years ago which to me just goes to show how little we including scientists actually know much of what we have are guesses but I do find the estimates of 11,000 years ago to be quite interesting as it just so happens to be very close to the Younger driest climate catastrophe that was right in that time frame I can't help but wonder if this is related in some way and you know that reminds me does this give any credence to the declassified documents that I discussed in a recent video where it was stated that the Earth's poles rapidly shift and are followed by an immediate reversal every 6500 years I mean really why on earth was the CIA discussing this book in a meeting and why did they classify the notes from that meeting now whether or not the information discussed in those documents is true whatever it was that happened on earth in that period of time to rapidly turn the Sahara into a massive desert from what was a lush tropical environment well there's no doubt that the abrupt changes would have meant disaster to wildlife vegetation and of course the civilizations that occupied the Sahara at that time and when we consider the Sahara Desert geographical location to Egypt or should I say the fact that Egypt is within the Sahara Desert and combining the fact that the land of ancient Egypt is without a doubt the largest concentration of ancient ruins and artifacts found anywhere on earth and that it just so happens to date back to the same period of time is when the Sahara was green for example it has long been said the Egypt's first dynasty dates back to just over five thousand years ago and the alleged first Egyptian pyramid is estimated to have been constructed around that time as well or at least within the timeframe of when the Sahara was said to be green so hold that thought and consider the awkward fact that I've mentioned in numerous past videos which is that the Great Sphinx of Giza has massive amounts of rain water erosion within its enclosure and I say awkward because the experts have always claimed that the Sphinx must be around 4,500 years old yet recent geological analysis implies that this cannot be the case as the last time the Nile Delta region had significant rainfall was more than seven thousand years ago right in the timeframe of when the Sahara was Green and had ten times the rainfall that it does today in other words the scientific data overwhelmingly suggests that the Sphinx is at least double the age of what we were taught in school which of course only further adds to the mystery of ancient Egypt itself but think about what all of this means the ancient ruins and relics that have been found from the Egyptians is concentrated largely around the Nile River and this makes total sense as civilizations exist where there's water so combine that with the timeframe estimates of when the Sahara went from a lush green tropical paradise to a massive barren desert several thousand years ago well there's obviously a connection here and going back to what I just pointed out regarding the ancient Egyptians developing their civilization along the Nile River and while taking into account that the Sahara Desert was actually a hospitable environment made up of rivers and lakes at that same period of time we should ask ourselves if the old legends stating that the Nile River once ran from west to east have merits I mean could this be true because let's not forget what Herodotus the so-called father of history had written and described in his literature at the time of 450 BC which others later went on to create into a map after his death and this map annotates what Herodotus described that the Nile River went west to east right through the Sahara as it eventually curved north and went right up through the Nile Delta notice how it originates in the Western Sahara though approximately in the land of what is now modern-day Mauritania which just so happens to be the same geographical location of a massive network of ancient dried-up rivers that were discovered by scientists in 2015 and do you want to guess the timeframe of when they believed these rivers last existed 5,000 years ago what a coincidence as this finding was completely separate from the studies that declared that the Sahara Desert was Green as recently as 5000 years ago which by the way the newly discovered rivers were not exclusive to just Mauritania have they have been found throughout the Sahara in fact at least three different networks of rivers have been identified so far and they all happen to date back to approximately 5000 years ago it's pretty remarkable that separate teams of scientists and researchers working in different parts of the world found several different lines of evidence to come to these conclusions conclusions that just so happened to match each other so precisely and the implications of this are enormous because undoubtedly ancient humans would have lived and migrated along these networks of rivers that enveloped much of the Sahara just as ancient Egyptians did so along the Nile River and look at what I found while researching this a study that flat-out corroborates how ancient rivers in the Sahara would have likely supported human migration routes it seems to me that these areas around the rivers need to be excavated now take a look at this illustration of the network of rivers identified so far and notice how it compares to Herodotus map which shows the Nile going east southeast before it erupted Lee curves to the north I find the similarity very interesting leave a comment and share what your thoughts are on all of this and see if you see the comparison as well but real quick you'll likely remember me citing her Adonis's map last year in my third video on Atlantis and the recut structure as he had written and described the capital of Atlantis being located south of the Outlets mountains in the Western Sahara and later in this video I'm going to share something very interesting with you that involves the Sahara Desert and the Recon structure but the point right now is that the latest scientific evidence shows us that a massive network of rivers traveled through the Sahara before whatever it was it happened to turn it into a desert where it was then consumed with sand and long-forgotten not to be discovered until at least 5,000 years later and speaking of being consumed with sand here's something interesting to think about which is the condition that Egypt was initially found when it was surveyed by outsiders in more modern times most of it was completely buried in sand for thousands of years it's almost as if the actual people who created these mind-boggling structures were wiped out and erased from memory before others eventually arrived and made it their home I mean let's not forget that not one single hieroglyph or petroglyph shows anything about the pyramids literally nothing not one single one why is that what's that about I mean hell let's not forget the awkward fact that the modern language of in Egypt is not even close to the same language that the dynastic Egyptians spoke and we have only made any sense of Egyptian hieroglyphs because of the rosetta stone just think about that could this be further evidence that two completely different civilizations live there thousands of years apart perhaps separated in time following the collapse of the green Sahara I mean clearly something occurred in Egypt to erase so much and create the incredibly mysterious nature of this lost civilization that we debate so much about today much of which was somehow destroyed massive statues toppled over and not only that what on earth destroyed certain pyramids there is more than one like this an unexplained mystery that very few people are even aware of and I say mystery because no I do not believe that a bunch of angry people with copper sledgehammers did this not a second however that's a topic for another video that I'll certainly make but getting back on the topic of the green Sahara it probably would have looked more like the Amazon than the desert that we see today we really need to use our imaginations to wrap our heads around how different this area would have looked at that point in time and what would that have meant for ancient human civilizations living there and besides the vast network of rivers I haven't even discussed the ancient dried-up lakes that were in the Sahara at the same period of time as those rivers one of which is said to have been the largest freshwater lake ever known to have existed ancient lake chad which at one point covered nearly 140,000 square miles of surface coverage or more than 360 thousand square kilometers to put that into perspective all of the North American Great Lakes combined make up just over ninety four thousand square miles or 240,000 square kilometers simply mind-boggling and there were other massive lakes there as well one of which when at its highest level covered more than 42,000 square miles or more than 108 thousand square kilometers and it wasn't even discovered until later in 2010 but go figure because look at what it looks like today you would never know that anything was there at all it's amazing how wind sand and heat as a way of erasing everything even over just five thousand years take a look at this illustration which shows the known locations of siharan lakes that existed between 9,000 years ago and present-day they were all over the Sahara and guess what these massive Sahara Lakes are all said to have dried up approximately 5,000 years ago the same estimated period of time as the network of rivers and keep in mind that the discovery of these lakes were separate from the discovery of the rivers identified years apart by totally different scientists and researchers so in other words the Sahara Desert was a freakin paradise just a few thousand years ago and what makes it even more interesting is that we're just now starting to figure this out which means that there are incredible discoveries waiting to be found throughout this massive region this is just the beginning of what has the potential to be the greatest archaeological discoveries ever found I mean the Sahara may very well be the ancient jackpot especially when you consider its proximity to ancient Egypt because the discoveries are already happening despite the fact that most of the Sahara is one of the least studied archaeological places on earth the discoveries are now increasing in frequency thanks of course to the modern technology being utilized on drones and satellites they're even referring to it as archaeology from space the high altitude and space borne radar technology is allowing scientists to conduct ground-penetrating radar that penetrates up to a few meters deep and actually that was what they were capable of back in the mid 1990s so I have a feeling that the technology has developed significantly since then think about that but thanks to this technology over just the past few years discoveries have been found in countries ranging from Libya all the way over to the Western Sahara and keep in mind that Libya neighbours Egypt directly to the west literally sharing the same desert and in the middle of the Libyan desert they've discovered castle-like fortresses that shocked archaeologists as of course nobody thought anyone had ever lived there but what they found were walls 13 feet or 4 meters high and even sophisticated irrigation systems they're even starting to find mysterious ruins as far away as the Western Sahara although they may not look impressive hundreds of the stone structures have been found so far and what's interesting is the remote location of these findings and the fact that nobody knows who made them or when and they're also at surface level so the question becomes what else could be buried and waiting to be unearthed in this area and there are other ancient ruins scattered throughout the Sahara from Algeria to Chad some of these ruins are of course credited to the Romans which I do not disagree with however the question I have is what are we not seeing that's buried beneath all this sand and where these structures built on top of older ancient structures which is something commonly seen throughout the world but even if these structures are all at surface level you may not even know about it anyway I mean most people have no idea that there are sophisticated ancient ruins in Sudan including pyramids and this not forget the Sudan borders Egypt directly to the south is there a connection here and you know when you consider the incredible size of the Sahara which spans three and a half million square miles or nine million square kilometres and is more than three thousand miles across from one coast to the other as it stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea and although most of the deserts is not actually covered in massive sand dunes the parks there are are as deep as 100 to 141 feet in depth and make no mistake some of the greatest discoveries from her ancient past may very well be waiting to be exhumed under dunes just like these I mean this area is so big that it literally affects weather systems around the world for instance winds from the Sahara created a heat wave in Britain just this summer and not only that the sands of the Sahara were carried all the way over to Houston Texas word affected the color of the sky making it yellow and this storm did more than increase the temperatures in Britain and turned the sky yellow in Texas because it even delayed the hurricane season in the Atlantic and Caribbean as well I mean come on that is absolutely incredible but there's more the sands of the Sahara Desert even fertilized the Amazon rainforest every year millions of tons of dust containing rich nutrients including tens of thousands of tons of phosphorus is carried across the Atlantic Ocean and end up fertilizing the soils of South America I mean Wow right it truly is incredible to think that this region is affecting weather and ecosystems around the world but I suppose it makes sense it just simply never occurred to me until I started researching this topic but here's something else that's really interesting to think about so humans are said to have originated in Africa right so how do we know that there's not areas of Africa aside from the Sahara Desert that have ancient ruins waiting to be discovered for example in the Congo jungle and rainforest remember what I shared in my previous video involving airborne lidar conducting 3d mapping of the Guatemalan jungle which identified tens of thousands of buried Mayan ruins that scientists discovered just last year areas of this dense jungle that had already been surveyed on foot were unable to see any of these remnants as they had been consumed by the earth and jungle in less than 1,200 years which is unbelievably quick I mean even consumed a seven-story pyramid that they literally walked right by during previous survey mapping while on foot and this is only what they found so far there are vast areas of jungle in Central and South America that have not been scanned in fact only an incredibly small portion had been scanned in comparison to what's left so is it possible that there are other discoveries waiting to be made that are buried in jungles such as Central Africa where literally nobody is looking and never have just something to think about now I mentioned early in this video that I want to discuss some details involving the Sahara Desert and the recon structure as it pertains to the lost city of Atlantis in my prior videos I suggested that North Africa appears to have been obliterated with tidal forces that may have originated from the Mediterranean Sea and flowed through the rakaat structure in Mauritania which could have been what caused Atlantis's destruction and that's assuming that this was Atlantis as the legend states that it was consumed and fell into the depths of the sea and by simply looking at satellite imagery it's not hard to see the evidence of vast water erosion well listen to this in just the past few weeks a shocking discovery was made that was based on a 20-year study conducted by scientists and researchers that proved that the ocean literally ran right through the heart of North Africa at one point in the past allegedly tens of millions of years ago and they're calling it the trans-saharan Seaway and the implications of this are absolutely astounding just look at where it originates in North Africa and snakes its way through the Sahara through the same location that I suggested in my prior video and we now know that yes this area that looks like water flowed right through it actually did now of course this map does not show it going west through the structure but if you simply go to Google Earth and view and play around with the elevations above sea level in all these outlined areas you'll quickly find that the path through the Recon structure is at the same elevations as the trans-saharan Seaway again look at this and tell me that tidal forces didn't flow right through here and in fact people that have recently visited the recod on foot observed that the structure is right down to bedrock just as you'd expect if the freaking ocean had blasted right through it but what is left are massive salt deposits at surface level in and around the recut structure I did not include this significant detail in my prior videos because I wasn't positive on it at the time but it yes it has since been confirmed without a doubt the ocean was once here so the question becomes when and although there is of course doubt as to whether the Ricoh structure could be the location of velocity of Atlantis but I've since dug deeper and I've come across new information much of which is unbelievably fascinating and a few details that virtually nobody knows about information that will make even the skeptics of this location second guess in question what might be possible but I'll stop myself there because there is a lot more to share a lot more and it's certainly debatable so I'll have to make another video on the topic of the recut structure in Atlantis so look forward to that soon and I'll also be making another video on Atlantis involving other possible locations such as Santorini and the Azores Islands and other places so look forward to that but the topic of Atlantis aside what on earth is waiting to be discovered underneath the sands of the Sahara I mean mark my words I'm telling you in our lifetimes there's gonna be some massive discoveries they're gonna happen in the Sahara that are gonna blow our minds because if all of the Sahara a thousands of miles across was green tropical vegetated with rivers and lakes and humans originated from Africa you can bet that people were living there so the question becomes what's there waiting to be found but anyways I'll close this up here this is getting long but I'm Jimmy this is bright insight hit the like button and subscribe and leave a comment and let me know what your thoughts are on all of this and everything that I discuss in the video and without a doubt there are other places around the world that are very likely to have an abundance of unknown inch true uns waiting to be discovered such as Central America South America and other places too so anyways guys I'll leave it at that take care and look forward to another video coming real soon bye everybody", "oMm0-6UAVpE": "From creepy creatures in the mountains to alien hieroglyphics, here are 10 of the most mysterious things found in Russia\u2026. 10. Creature in a Diamond Mine In 2016, miners in Siberia found something truly bizarre while they were digging in the sand. Described by some as a mummified demon spawn, it\u2019s not entirely clear what creature it is. With the age of the region, could it be a dinosaur? Or, perhaps, a more recent creature like a sable or a pine marten (members of the weasel family)? It was found in the Mirninsky district of the Sakha Republic, in a region known for the large number of diamonds that can be found there. The sands have been dated to the Mesozoic era, more than 66 million years ago, and pretty often reveal ancient fossils and things, but no one knew quite what to make of this particular discovery. They think it could be some type of mummified mammal even like a young wolverine. Its small body, and deadly looking skull means it could conceivably be any of those suggestions, but further tests are needed to know for sure. The specimen was taken to the regional capital of Yakutsk to try and understand more but, as of yet, no results have been published. 9. Megalithic Monuments Deep within the Caucasus mountains of Russia, near Sochi, are thousands of strange structures that archaeologists are still struggling to understand, despite having been there for up to 25,000 years. Known as \u201cdolmens\u201d, there\u2019s some dispute as to quite how old they are- but one thing\u2019s for sure, they\u2019re a unique type of architecture that\u2019s seen nowhere else. Like other megaliths, they were built using large rocks that were cut following the natural geometric shapes. Usually there\u2019s a court towards the front that may have been used as a place for rituals, and bronze and iron age pottery has been found littering the sites, which is why they have been able to be dated so far back. New dolmens are found all the time, and there are at least 3,000 that are known of- usually in clusters of tens or hundreds. No human remains have been found in them, so it\u2019s unlikely that they were being used as tombs, but the mystery continues and is one of the most prevailing unanswered questions that Russian researchers have yet to solve. 8. Giant Craters These next discoveries have only just started to appear in recent years, and are thought to be some of the first noticeable signs that global warming is having a damaging impact on world, starting with the Russian landscape. In 2014, three gigantic craters were found in Siberia, with some as large as 250 feet (76.2m) in diameter! One of them, on the Yamal peninsula, was then seen to be surrounded by 20 smaller craters, all full with water, within a year of the original one appearing. As each year passes, more of these holes are being picked up by satellite imagery of the area, which is now intently looking for more evidence of why this is happening. Craters are everywhere and the landscape is falling apart! The size and immediacy of these craters suggest that some explosive force might be to blame. The leading theory is that, as temperatures in the land are rising, large amounts of gas hydrates are being released and start exploding through the softened ground. The craters are beginning to have a detrimental effect on the region, with wildlife suffering the most. The tundra, is literally starting to thaw!! Herd animals better watch out as they migrate across. If it continues to happen, measures will have to be taken to try and prevent its spread, or risk losing the landscape for good. And now for one of the most mysterious events of all time!! But first be sure to subscribe and click on the notification bell!! 7. Dyatlov Pass Incident In 1959, mountain rescuers found what would become an enduring mystery in Russia, known as the Dyatlov Pass incident. A few weeks earlier, 9 ski hikers had gone missing while on a trip to reach the Otorten mountain- a route that was, at the time, classified as a category 3- the most difficult. They were all very experienced with this type of expedition and shouldn\u2019t have encountered too many difficulties. Something, though, went terribly wrong. Rescuers first of all, found the tent that had been abandoned and badly damaged and slashed. All of the groups\u2019 belongings and shoes were left inside, but there was no sign of them. It appeared as if the tent had been cut down from the inside, and everyone ran out into the woods in socks or barefoot. Sets of 9 footprints led from the tent to the nearby woods in the snow. Here they found the first two bodies near the remains of a fire. They had attempted to climb up a tree for unknown reasons, but succumbed to the cold. Their bodies lay there, but showed signs of having been moved after they had died. Things got more bizarre when the other bodies were found over the next few days. Three of the final group that were found showed signs of fatal internal injuries- the sort you\u2019d expect from a car crash, but without any external damage. One was missing her tongue, and some of their clothes were found to be radioactive. The story has since become legend in the mountains, but to this day it\u2019s still a complete mystery as to what happened to those unfortunate travellers. 6. Volgograd Discs In 2015, when a group of UFO hunters began excavating a site in the Volgograd region, not even they could have expected to find something so bizarre. In the ground were more than a dozen stone discs. Most of them were about a meter (3.3 feet) in diameter, but there was also one that was twice that size. The shape of these discs have clearly excited UFO theorists because of their similarity to a traditional flying saucer shape, and to add fuel to speculation the team that found them said they were primarily made from Tungsten, a material often used in military applications. The team that discovered the discs have come up with some radical theories about their origin, claiming that they\u2019re more than a million years old and from an alien race. Scientists who have been studying them, though, think there\u2019s a more believable terrestrial reason for them, and think they could be unusual features created by the flow of ice across the landscape. So what do you think? Alien Hieroglyphics or natural markings? 5. Arkaim In 1987 an archaeological team, from the University of Chelyabinsk, uncovered an ancient fortress that dated back to about 2 or 3 thousand years ago. It\u2019s called Arkaim, and is often referred to as the Russian Stonehenge- possibly even pre-dating the structure built by the druids in England. There are two circular walls, all surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall and a moat. Inside there are a series of rectangular shaped structures, thought to be living spaces. A further 35 houses were found outside the main structure, and there was even a sophisticated water and sewage system. Tombs and mines were also discovered, and the entire place would have been meticulously planned before being built- something quite unusual for the time. It looks like Arkaim served as a fortress for its inhabitants for about 200 years, but then they all suddenly left. There are no clues yet as to who these people were, or why they were so advanced compared to other cultures at the time. Some strange phenomenon has been reported at the site, such as magnetic anomalies and unusual weather, but this could have a lot to do with its location. Similar to Stonehenge, Arkaim was purposefully built with the understanding of the movement of the sun in the sky, and would have been used to celebrate the summer and winter solstices. 4. Ancient Flying Saucer In 2015 there was another discovery of a mysterious disc, this time in the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia. Lots of strange activity and alien discs in Russia!! It\u2019s a region known for coal deposits and, during an excavation more than 130 feet underground, they found this flying saucer-shaped rock. It\u2019s almost perfectly circular, weighs about 440 pounds, and is about 4 feet in diameter. What\u2019s more, the excavators actually found two of the objects but the first, unfortunately, was destroyed while they were digging. To give some perspective of how old this object could be, mammoth bones have been found in the area at depths of about 80 feet, so this disc seems to be much, much more ancient. It seems highly unlikely that this is a natural formation, but if it was manmade, what was the purpose of it? There\u2019s very little record of civilisations living in the region, which makes this all the more bizarre. But, with large rock structures being found all over Russia, who knows what else could be lurking deep beneath the ground and ready to be discovered? 3. Creature Near Power Plant This next discovery is the real life version of one of the most famous Simpsons episodes, but far more bizarre than a 3-eyed-fish. In 2015, two residents of Sosnovy Bor were walking along the local river, and found this bizarre body floating in the water. The river was built in the 1950\u2019s to provide water to the Leningrad nuclear power plant, so what kind of creature is this? Initial suggestions pointed towards it being a mutant chicken embryo, but with no neck, wings, and such an elongated head this seems unlikely. It doesn\u2019t, though, resemble any known animal, so DNA swabs were taken to try and understand more about it. Since then, no information has been released about what was found, which has excited alien researchers- some of who think it\u2019s an extra-terrestrial. Despite the more outlandish theories the answer, however, is likely to be far more simple- quite often animals are born with deformities that make them unrecognisable around this river and, with the presence of a nuclear reactor nearby, this is by far the most likely and disturbing explanation. 2. Ancient Microchip Computer chips are a relatively recent invention, right? Well this bizarre discovery has got some people thinking that they aren\u2019t as new as we thought. A fisherman in the Krasnodar region found this peculiar rock and, on it, there appears to be some form of ancient technology that resembles today\u2019s microchips. Tests on the object show it to be embedded in the rock, with some suggestions dating it to as far back as 250 million years- long before humans evolved on our planet. Geologists and other scientists simply cannot explain the creation of this chip, and it certainly isn\u2019t made by natural processes. If it truly is that old, then it would completely change our understanding of the development of life on earth. Of course, it could also be a natural formation of the type not ever seen before, or even something much newer that managed to get itself entombed within the rock somehow. So far nobody knows. 1. Demonic Skulls and Nazi Briefcase Saved the weirdest for last! A team of explorers found a cave on Mount Bolshoi Tjach, and inside were a pair of very odd shaped, demonic looking skulls. To make things even weirder, someone else made another find in the region- a Nazi briefcase with a full German colour map of the Adygea region that had been made in 1941. This briefcase bore the emblem of the Ahnenerbe, a secretive Nazi faction that was tasked with proving the Aryan race once controlled the whole planet. The Nazis were also known for their dealings with the occult, and the links between these two finds haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by some- thinking it\u2019s proof that they made contact with extraterrestrial beings, or managed to summon something deadly from deep within the earth. Or at least they tried. There is a more down to earth explanation for the skulls, which could have been exposed to weathering processes for long periods of time and been misshaped, but there\u2019s still the question of the briefcase, and why the Nazis were so interested in the region during the war.

calm [Music]", "bf7BXwVeyWw": "Translator: Nabil Tawfik Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla A few months ago The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded To two teams of astronomers Disclosure was praised As one of the most important Absolutely astronomical discoveries Today, after they briefly describe what they have discovered I will tell you about a very controversial framework To explain their discovery Specifically his name is possibility That way beyond Earth Milky Way and other distant galaxies We can find our universe It is not the only universe But it is instead Part of the large complex universes What we call a multiverse Now the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039multiverse is a strange idea I mean, most of us are educated to believe The word \"universe\" means everything And I say that most of us are with some study Like my four-year-old daughter, you hear me talk about these ideas from birth And last year I was carrying it And I said, \"Sofia, I love you more than anything in the universe. And she turned to me and said \"Dad, The universe or the multiverse (Laughter) But to prevent such abnormal upbringing It is strange to imagine Other worlds are separated from us Most of them have basically different features So we can directly call it the universes themselves Until now Conflict over the idea is for sure I aim to persuade you There is a reason to take the matter seriously As if it were correct I will tell you a story about the multiverse in three parts In the first part I will describe the results of winning this Nobel Prize And shed light on the deep mystery That these results highlighted In the second part I will offer a solution to this mystery It is built on an approach called string theory And there is where an idea will emerge Multiple universes in the story Finally, in the third part I will describe the cosmological theory It is called inflation Which will pull all the pieces of the story together Well, the first part starts in the past in 1929 When the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized The distant galaxies Spacing in a hurry from us What establishes that space itself is expanding Expands Now this was revolutionary The ruling was widespread The universe is still But even so There was something that everyone was sure of The expansion must slow Where, as far as gravity pulls Earth Slow down an apple thrown up The gravitational pull For each galaxy than the other It should slow down Space expansion Now, let's move quickly into the 1990s When these two astronomers rose up That I mentioned at the beginning After inspiring them with this logic To measure the rate In which this expansion is slowed down And they did the following By tireless observation For many distant galaxies Allowing them to draw a map On how the rate of expansion has changed over time And here was the surprise They found that the expansion was not slowing down But they found it accelerating Faster and faster This is like throwing an apple up It goes up faster and faster Now if you see an apple do that You have to find out why What drives it The same thing, the results of astronomers Certainly they deserved worthy Nobel Prize But they asked a similar question What is the force that drives all galaxies? To go away quickly from each other In an accelerated way Well, the most promising answer It comes from Einstein's old idea You see, we are used to gravity It is a force that only does one thing Pulls things together But Einstein's theory of gravity His general theory of relativity Gravity can also push things apart How ? Well, according to Einstein's calculations If the void is filled uniformly Invisible card Somewhat like regular, invisible fog So gravity is born from that fog This is alienating Unattractive attraction This is exactly what we need to interpret the notes Because gravity is repellent Invisible energy in space Now we call it dark energy But I made her smoke white here so you can see her Its repulsive energy It will cause each galaxy to push against the other Driving expansion to acceleration Not to slow down And this explanation It represents great progress But I promise you mystery This is the first part This is When the astronomers worked on How much dark energy It must be implanted into space It must be calculated for cosmic velocity Look what they found The number is small Expressed in related units It is amazingly small And the mystery is to explain this strange figure We want this number to come out From the laws of physics But so far, no one has found a way to do this Now you might be surprised Do you care Maybe explain this number Just a technical issue Technical details of interest to experts But it is not related to anyone else Well it's definitely technical details But some details really matter Some details give A window into the unknown kingdom of reality This strange number can do that The only entrance to this has so far made progress in explaining this It calls for the possibility of other universes The idea that it is naturally out of the chain theory Which takes me to the first part: string theory Ear while keeping the mystery of ambiguous energy In the background of your mind Where I will tell you b Three main things about string theory First, what is it? Well this is an introduction to realize Einstein's dream On the unified theory of physics Single comprehensive framework It is possible to describe All forces while working in the universe The central idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039string theory Actually a direct idea It says that if you test Any part of a substance with infinite precision At first you will find particles Then you will find atoms and atomic particles But the theory says that if you can break up to smaller Much smaller than we can with current technologies You might find something else inside these particles Thin string vibrates from energy Accurate strings vibrate Exactly the strings attached to the violin It can vibrate in different molds Producing various musical notes These are basic little leads When shaking in different patterns It produces various types of particles Including electrons, quarks, neutrons, and photons All the other particles It will unite in a single framework While all of them arise from the vibrating strings It is a compelling picture A kind of cosmic symphony Where all the rich That we see in the world around us He comes out of the music These small and small things can play music But there is a price For this elegant autism Because years of research Show that string theory is not exactly calculated There is an asymmetry that exists Unless we give For some totally unfamiliar things Extra dimensions in space That is, we all know about the three dimensions of space And you can think about this It is the height, width and depth But string theory says it's on small scales in an imaginary way There are extra dimensions Accumulated in a compact, delicate size We could not find it But even though the dimensions are hidden But it does have an effect on things we can notice Because the shape of the extra dimensions Restricts how the strings are able to vibrate And in string theory Vibration defines everything So it is the particle quantities, and its strengths And most importantly, the amount of dark energy Be determined In the form of extra dimensions So if we know the shape of the extra dimensions We will be able to calculate these features Calculate the amount of dark energy the challenge If we did not know It is the shape of extra dimensions All we know It is a list of filtered shapes Account available Now when these ideas were developed There were only about five candidate forms So you can imagine it One-by-one analysis To determine any outcome It will result from physical features But over time this list has grown Because the researchers found other candidate forms From five, the number grew to hundreds and then thousands Large but group still under control and can be analyzed After all Graduating students need something to do But the list continued to grow To millions and billions until today The list of candidate shapes has increased To about 10 to 500 Then what to do ? Some researchers lost his heart It concluded that with this number of shapes nominated for additional dimensions Each height has different physical features String theory would not Specifically testable predictions But others turned this issue in their minds We took to the possibility of multiple universes Here is the idea These forms are likely to be on par with all others Everyone is real like all others Meaning There are many universes Each of them has a shape for the extra dimensions This is a radical offer It has a profound effect on mystery The amount of dark energy was discovered by the results of the Nobel Prize winners Because you see If there were other universes If only these universes were Each of them, I suppose, has a different form of extra dimension So the physical features of each universe will be different In particular The amount of dark energy in each universe It will be different Which means that the mystery In the interpretation of the amount of dark energy that we measured It will be taken completely differently in this context The laws of physics cannot explain one number of dark energy Because there is no one number There are many numbers By what means We have asked the wrong question Is the right question is Why do we find ourselves as human beings in a universe? With a measure of dark energy we have measured Instead of any of the other possibilities That are out there And that is a question that enables us to move forward Because these universes That has dark energy more than our universe When this substance tries to clump in galaxies The repulsive dark energy is strong To the extent that the mass is inflated into parts Galaxies do not form And in these galaxies that have much less dark energy It quickly collapses on itself Here again, galaxies do not form Without galaxies, there are no stars or planets There is no chance For any form of life To be in those universes So we find ourselves in a universe With a specified amount of dark energy that we measured Simply because our universe has conditions Hospitable to the form of life we \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039live And that would It solves mystery Multiple universes were found And now there are some who do not find this explanation satisfactory We have used physics To give us a specific explanation of the features that we have detected But the topic is If only the features that you monitor Can and do take Wide variety of different values Across a wider area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039truth So think about one explanation For a certain value It is simply misleading And in an advanced example It comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler And who was obsessed with understanding Different number Why is the sun 93 million miles away from Earth? He worked for decades trying to explain this number But it did not work and we know why Kepler was asking Wrong question We now know that there are many planets On various dimensions of its host stars So with the hope that the laws of physics You will explain a certain number, 93 million miles Well this is simply a wrong trend Instead, the right question to ask is: Why do we find ourselves humans on a planet? At this specific distance Instead of other possibilities? Also, this is a question that we can answer Those planets that are much closer to a star like the sun It will be very hot The way we do not have the form of life we \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039live in And those planets that are far from the sun It is too cold Just as unbearable as the life form we live So we have found ourselves On a planet at this specified distance Because it simply gets conditions Vital for the way we live And when you come to planets and their distances This is clearly the right kind of justification The goal is When we come to the dark universes and energy that they contain It could also be the right kind of justification There is a fundamental difference, of course It is that we know there are other planets But until now I had speculated a possibility There are likely to be other universes And to put everyone together We need a mechanism You can actually generate other universes This takes me to the last part, the third part Because such a mechanism has been found By cosmic scientists trying to understand the big bang Do you see, when we talk about the Big Bang Often we have a picture About a kind of cosmic explosion Who created our universe And put space in an accelerated exit state But there is a small secret The Big Bang left something a little important The explosion It tells us how the universe developed after the explosion But it does not give us an insight Of what might be giving the force the explosion itself This gap was finally filled out By an improved version of the Big Bang theory This is called cosmic expansion That defines a specific type of fuel Which of course was born Outer acceleration of space The fuel is based on something called a quantum field But the only detail that interests us This fuel is proven to be efficient That is probably by default Use them all Meaning in the theory of expansion The Big Bang gave the beginning to our universe Which is not the same as a one-time event Instead, the fuel did not just generate the Big Bang But he also generated countless other big explosions Each of them gave rise to being separate With our universe who became one bubble In the big bubble bath of the universes And now, when we fused that with string theory Here is the picture that led us to it Each of these universes has extra dimensions Additional dimensions are formed in a variety of different shapes Different shapes result in different physical features And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another Simply because it is only in our universe These are physical features like the amount of dark energy It is suitable for the way of life we \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039live in This is the controversial Cairo picture Of the broader universes Cutting edge on monitoring and theory It has led us to a dangerous consideration One big question, of course, remains Are we sure? From other universes? Well, let me explain About what could have happened one day Stretch theory It has strong support for notes Because the theory predicts The big bang can be quite powerful So that the space has expanded rapidly So that if we had a quantity of the exact world It may be extending out into the big world Producing distinctive fingerprints A pattern of slightly hotter points and slightly cooler points Through space Which has been spotted by powerful telescopes now And by going away, if there were other universes This theory predicts that every now and then These universes can collide And if our universe was struck by another universe It will produce this collision Extra soft shape From global warming through space Maybe one day That we can discover it And like this stranger Possibly one day Based on the notes That adopts other universes I'll summarize With surprising inclusion For all these ideas For the very distant future You see, we have learned Our universe is not static And that space expands And that expansion is accelerating And there may be other universes All are carefully tested To the light of an infinitesimal star It comes to us from distant galaxies But because the expansion is accelerating In the very distant future These galaxies will spaced away quickly So that we cannot see it Not because of our limited technology But because of the laws of physics The light that these galaxies emit It travels at a speed faster than the speed of light We will not be able to overcome The gap between us widens So astronomers are in the distant future They look into deep space They will see nothing but the infinite series From stillness, black ink They will be saved Until the universe is static and does not change It is filled with a single central oasis of matter That you inhabit Picture from universes That you definitely know is wrong Now, future astronomers may have records It was traded from a previous era Like us Demonstrate cosmic expansion Packed with galaxies But will these future astronomers believe? With such old information? Or will they believe In the empty, dark, black universe Who revealed their sophisticated observations? I doubt it is the second option Which means that we live During a distinctly distinct era When there are profoundly certain facts about the universes It's still within reach For the soul of human beings eager to explore It seems that it will not always be like this Because astronomer today By directing their powerful telescopes to the sky They picked up a bunch of photons full of glaring information A kind of cosmic telegram It takes billions of years to travel The message resonates through the ages clearly Sometimes nature guarded its secrets With an unbreakable grip Of physical laws Sometimes the nature of reality gestures Behind the horizon Thank you so much (clap) Chris Anderson: Thank you, Brian The amount of ideas you talked about Amazing, cheerful, and incredible What do you think From the cosmological place now Historically, somewhat Are we in the midst of something historically unusual from our point of view? BG: It's hard to say As when we learned to astronomers in the distant future They do not have enough information to know The natural question is, are we likely already in this situation? At a specific depth, the features are crucial to the universe Our ability to understand has escaped Because of how cosmology evolved From this perspective We can always ask questions We will not be able to fully answer them On the other side, we can now understand How old is the universe We can understand How to understand data from the microwave background This was dated 13.72 billion years ago And yet, we can perform calculations to predict what it will look like And they were matched It is amazing So on one hand, it just doesn't make sense that we got it But who knows what kind of obstacles we will find in the future CA: You will be around the next few days Some of these discussions will likely continue Thank you, thank you Brian. (BG: With pleasure) (clap)", "AxM9FYSs8V4": "Two Years Alone in the wilderness can make a man lonely", "t9c7aheZxls": "Translator: Abdulaziz Al-wandawi Auditor: Zeineb Trabelsi Fasten belts, We will head to Mars. Not just some astronauts - Thousands of people will colonize Mars. I inform you that we will do so soon. Some of you will be working on projects on Mars, I assure you that some of your children will live there. This may seem absurd, So I'm going to share with you how and when it will happen. But first I want to discuss the obvious questions: Why do we want to do this? 12 years ago, I've been on TED talk about ten ways the world can suddenly end up in. We are very vulnerable to the whims of our galaxy. One large asteroid can completely end us. In order to survive, we have to reach beyond our planet. Think about how catastrophic it will be If all what the person has accomplished has been erased. Another reason to go: Love exploration is taking place in our DNA. Man grew up two million years ago in Africa And then it spread slowly and steadily all over the planet By reaching the wilderness that was beyond their horizons. This thing is inside us. And they prospered by doing so. Some of the greatest works of progress are civilization and technology It came because we explored. Yes, we can do a lot of good With the money we need to create a prosperous colony on Mars. Yes, we all need to take better care of our planet. And I worry that we will destroy Mars just as we have done Earth wrong. But think for a moment, What we had when John Kennedy told us that we were going to send a person to the moon. The enthusiasm of an entire generation has sparked a dream. Imagine what our fascination would be when we see a landing on Mars. We might then look behind the ground And we see one people instead of many people Then we may go back to Earth, When we struggle to survive on Mars, And we will know how precious our planet was. So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're going to take. But first, Some amazing facts about where we are going. The image represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother, It is much less than half the size of the Earth, But despite the fact that it is smaller, The surface area you can stand on Is equal to the amount of land surface on which you can stand, Because most of the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surface is covered with water. And the weather on Mars is very light - 100 times lighter than Earth - It is not breathable because it contains 96% of carbon dioxide. And the weather is so cold over there. The average temperature is -81 degrees below zero, Although there is a big difference in temperature. And the length of day on Mars is equal to the length of day on Earth, Plus 39 minutes. The seasons and years extend to twice that of the earth. And anyone who wants to install wings and fly one day, Mars has much less gravity than it is on Earth, It is somewhere somewhere In it you can jump over your car to pass it instead of spinning around. And now, as you can see, Mars is not quite like Earth, But it is the most suitable place to live in our entire solar system. And here is the problem. Mars is very far from us, A thousand times away from us compared to our distance from the moon. The moon is 250 thousand miles away from us The Apollo trip took three days to arrive. While Mars is 250 million miles away from us It takes eight months to get there - 240 days. And if we set out on a certain day, On a precise date, biennial, When Mars and Earth converge, So that the distance traveled by the missile is as short as possible. 240 days is a long time to travel with your colleagues in a tin can. Our flight history to Mars is still poor. We (America) have accompanied the Russians, the Europeans and the Japanese The Chinese and the Indians, Already sending 44 missiles there, But many of them are either lost or destroyed. Only about a third of the flights to Mars were successful. We currently do not have a missile large enough to get there anyway. And we had one before, Saturn 5. Two Saturn 5 missiles can get us there. It was the most amazing machine a person ever built, And it was the missile that brought us to the moon. But the last Saturn 5 missile was used in 1973 to propel the Space Lab station to its location. Then we decided to build something new that we called the shuttle Instead of continuing to Mars after we landed on the Moon. Our biggest rocket is now Half of our need is to send anything to Mars. Going to Mars will not be easy This leads us to a really important question ... When will the first person land there? Well, some critics believe that if we got there in 2050. This would be a good achievement. NASA claims it can deliver humans to Mars in 2040. This may be possible. I believe they can deliver humans to the orbit of Mars in 2035. But honestly, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone would be interested in sending a missile in 2035 to Mars, Because we will already be there. We will land on Mars in 2027. And the reason is This man is determined to make it happen. His name is Elon Musk, and he is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Motors. He actually told me that he would land on Mars in 2025, But Elon Musk is more optimistic than me - Very much-- So I give him some years as a lull. But... You have to ask yourself, Can this person do that in 2025 or 2027? Well, let's look at a decade from Elon Musk's point of view. Where was it ten years ago? This is Tesla Electric Tires Company. In 2005 many auto workers were saying, We will not have decent electric cars 50 years ago, And where was that? This is the SpaceX 9 Falcon missile, Carries 6 tons of supplies to the International Space Station. 10 years ago, SpaceX did not fire anything or any missile anywhere. So I think this is a good bet That the person who revolutionized the auto industry In less than 10 years And the person who created a complete missile company in less than 10 years Capable of reaching Mars by 2027. Now that you know this: Governments and robots are not controlling it now, Private companies are jumping into space They will be happy to take you to Mars. This calls for a very important question to be asked. Can we really live there? Well, people may not be able to take us there before 2040, Or we might get there much earlier than NASA, But NASA took great responsibility for determining how we can live on Mars. Let's look at the problem this way. Here is what you need to live on Earth: Food, water, housing and clothes. Here's what you will need to live on Mars: All of the above plus oxygen. Let's look at the most important things on this list first. Water is the foundation of life that we know, It is too heavy for us to carry it from Earth to Mars to live. So we have to find water if we want our lives to succeed on Mars. If we look at Mars, we will find it very dry. And it looks as if the planet is a desert. But it turns out the opposite. Dust alone on Mars contains 60% of water. And satellites have shown us around Mars and are still - And by the way, this is a real picture - Much of the craters on Mars have an ice sheet. It is not a bad place to establish a colony. Here's a picture of a small hole made by Phoenix Lander in 2008, It purifies the presence of snow directly below the surface of the soil - This white thing is snowman. And in the second picture, Captured four days after the first. You can see that some of it has evaporated. And the moons still tell us With massive amounts of groundwater on Mars In addition to glaciers. In fact, if the ice melted only on the poles of Mars, Most of the surface of Mars would have been under 30 feet of water. So, there is a lot of water in there, But most of it is ice and most is underground, It takes a lot of energy and a lot of manpower to get it out. This is a machine made at Washington University In 1998. It's actually a simple dehumidifier. And it turns out that Mars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere is usually 100% wet. This device can withdraw and extract the water that humans will need Simply from the atmosphere of Mars. Then we have to pay attention to what we will breathe. Frankly, I was very surprised When it was discovered that NASA had already solved the problem. This is a scientist from MIT named Michael Hecht. And he developed this machine, Moxy. I like this thing. It is a fundamentally reversed fuel cell, It absorbs Martian atmosphere and pumps oxygen. And you must remember that carbon dioxide - It makes up 96% of Mars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere - But carbon dioxide contains 78% oxygen. Now the next spacecraft that NASA will send to Mars will be in 2020 And you will carry one of these devices with it And enough oxygen will be produced To keep one person alive for an unlimited period But the secret behind this - And this is just for testing - The secret is that this thing was designed from the start To be minimized 100 times. The next thing, what are we going to eat? Well, we're going to use agriculture in water to provide food, But we will not be able to For more than 15-20% of our food there, At least for as long as the water runs on Mars And we actually have the potential and the potential to grow crops. Until then, Most of our food will come from Earth, It will be dried. We will also need housing. Initially, inflatable and pressure built buildings can be used We can also use the same vehicles. But this only works during the day. There is a lot of solar radiation in addition to a lot of cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground. But the soil appears on Mars, Very good for making bricks. And NASA discovered that, too. They'll put some kind of plastic polymer into the bricks, Then put it in a microwave oven, Then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes, There are many of them. Finally clothes. On Earth there are miles of air piled on top of us, Which makes 15 pounds of pressure on our body permanently, And we're constantly pushing the pressure. But there is rarely any atmospheric pressure on Mars. So Dafa Newman, A scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of By making this stylish space suit. Will keep us together, It prevents radiation from us and keeps us warm. And let's think about this for a minute. Food, housing, clothes, water and oxygen .. We can do this. Actually we can do that. But the topic is still a little complicated and a little difficult. And this brings us to the step - The really big next step - It is to live our good life on Mars. In other words, the planet is largely reshaped: Make it almost like land, Re-engineering the entire planet. This seems like a lot of arrogance, But the truth is The technology that does everything about to tell you already exists. First we have to get some heating. Mars is very cold because the weather is very light. And the answer is here, on the south pole and the north pole of Mars, As her words are covered With an enormous amount of carbon dioxide - Dry ice. And if we heat it up, It will escalate directly to the atmosphere And the thickness of the atmosphere increases in the same way it does on the ground. And as we know, Carbon dioxide is a very effective gas for heating. Now, my favorite way to do this is to build a very large sail And its focus - It will mainly serve as a mirror - And focus on the south pole of Mars first. As the planet rotates, all of that dry ice will warm up. And he goes to the air. In fact, it won't take long So that the temperature on Mars begins to rise, It is possible that this will be done in less than twenty years. And now, And on an ideal day on the equator, In the middle of summer on Mars, The temperature may reach 70 degrees, But then it drops to 100 below zero at night. (Laughter) What we are targeting is the effect of global warming: Warm enough to see much ice on Mars - Especially the ice on the ground - it melts. And we will get real magic. Once the atmosphere thickens, everything improves. We get better protection against radiation, More air pressure will make us warmer, make the planet warmer, Vessel we have water This makes it possible to grow crops. Then the amount of water vapor in the air increases, to form another greenhouse gas. The sky will rain and snow will fall on Mars. The thick atmosphere will create enough pressure So that we can get rid of our space clothes. We only need five pounds of pressure to survive. Finally, we will make life on Mars look like life in British Columbia. But we will still have a complex problem About making the atmosphere breathable, This may take 1,000 years to achieve this. But humans are wonderfully smart and able to adapt well. Nobody can tell us what the future technology can do Nor can we know what we can do with our bodies. And in biology now, We're close to gaining control of our genetics, And what genes do in our bodies, And certainly, And in the end, how is our own development. We can end up with a species of man on Earth It differs slightly from the human species on Mars. But what will you do there? How will you live? Life will be like that on Earth. Someone will open a restaurant, Another will build an iron factory. Someone will make documentaries on Mars And he sells it on the floor. And one of the idiots will launch reality TV show. (Laughter) And there will be companies for programming, There will be hotels and bars. This is for sure: This will be the biggest change in our lives, And I think this will be the most inspiring. Ask any ten-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars. Children in primary school will now choose life there. Do you remember when we sent humans on the moon? When that happened, people looked at each other saying, \"If we can do this, we can do anything\" What will they think when we create a colony on Mars? and, most importantly, This would make us a class traveling in space This means that people will survive whatever happens to the Earth. We will not be the last of our kind. thank you. (clap)", "N-yALPEpV4w": "Translator: Rubik Cheng Reviewer: Amanda Chu thank you all When i was young My parents often take me to California for camping There are various places such as beaches, forests or deserts Some people say there is no life in the desert But my parents asked me to observe these wild animals around: Badger, eagle or tortoise, etc. Once we were camping Found a scorpion baby showing its sting At the moment I thought, it was so cool How could there be something so cute but so dangerous After college, I moved to California Embarked on some environmental-related activity plans Participated in the work to save the nation's last redwood forest And prevent radioactive waste storage in the desert. Shortly after turning 30 I decided to spend my whole life To address climate change I worry about global warming Will eventually destroy the natural environment that people try to protect To solve this problem, I think it \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technically simple. Popularization of electric vehicles with solar panels on all roofs, etc. The biggest problem is policy Therefore, I assist the nation's largest labor union and the largest environmental group to jointly organize an alliance Our proposal is a $ 300 billion renewable energy investment plan The idea is not just to prevent climate change And in a fast-growing high-tech field Create millions of jobs In 2007, our efforts paid off Barack Obama, then presidential candidate, embraces our vision Between 2009 and 2015 U.S. invests $ 150 billion in clean energy technologies, including renewable energy But at the beginning we encountered some problems First, the cost of electricity from rooftop solar panels is twice that of solar power plants And solar and wind power plants Requires a large area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039land to install solar panels and fans And build a huge power transmission system To send electricity from the countryside to the city These things are often affected by local communities And strong resistance from conservation biologists They worry that wild birds and other animals will be persecuted At the time, many people worked hard to solve this problem in terms of technology. A big challenge is the intermittent nature of solar and wind power They generate electricity only 10% to 30% of the year But there are still some proposals Think of the dam as a giant battery Meaning when the sun is exposed, when the wind is blowing The motor beats the water up and stores it When you need electricity, this water is sent to the turbine generator set. It doesn't seem so worrying when it comes to wildlife Domestic cats kill billions of birds every year Compared to only hundreds of thousands of birds died of fans I was thinking When scaling up solar and wind power Most of those problems can be solved with future advanced technology But years passed These problems still exist and are getting worse California is very committed to the development of renewable energy But plans to transform the dam into a large battery Not many completed Some are just geographical issues The dam must have eligible terrain to be transformed Even if eligible Still need a lot of money to achieve Not to mention other issues like water demand for irrigation Perhaps the most serious problem is California river and reservoir water Increasingly scarce and unstable due to climate change To prevent stability from affecting the overall power generation system We must stop delivering electricity from solar power plants to cities Because there are too many now Or spend money asking neighboring states like Arizona to consume our excess solar power Otherwise it will cause the grid to be overloaded and unable to supply power Speaking of birds and domestic cats Cats don't hurt eagles, but eagles can kill cats Cats kill small and common sparrows, jay and robin These birds are not likely to become extinct Eagles and large birds Like tooth eagles, owls, and condors and other threatened and endangered species The birds killed by wind turbines Fans are one of the biggest threats to these large birds Before installing wind turbines in recent years We never put so many things in the sky Speaking of solar energy Building a solar power plant is like building a farm Must free up a lot of land to clear away the wildlife This is one of the largest solar power plants in California. Aventa Solar Power Plant To build this power plant They have to clear the desert tortoise from the entire area Drag desert tortoises and baby tortoises directly out of the cave Put in truck and transport to captivity Many died there Recently it is estimated that about 6,000 birds are killed every year They are on fire above the solar power plant Fall to the ground Over time, I gradually realized Any technological development It \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to let the sun shine constantly and let the wind blow constantly You can only make solar panels cheap You can only make the fan bigger Sun and wind are so inefficient And in order to produce enough electricity You have to use a large area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039land In other words, the main problems of renewable energy are not technical. In the natural environment To deal with these unstable issues And the huge impact of these environments Obviously comes at a great economic cost We have heard too much in recent years News of solar panel and wind turbine prices falling But integrate all unstable power generation systems into the grid The cost is still considerable You can see it from California As the price of solar panels and wind turbines has fallen sharply What we are seeing is that the price of electricity has increased 5 times more than in other parts of the country. This is not our problem You can see the same situation happens in Germany Germany is a world leader in solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies Their electricity price has risen by 50% after vigorously promoting renewable energy You might think, fight climate change We have to spend more on energy I used to think so But look at the French example In terms of clean, zero-emission power generation France is twice as much as Germany But electricity prices are almost half that of Germany How did this happen? You may have guessed the answer 75% of France's electricity comes from nuclear energy Nuclear energy is much more reliable than renewable energy And generating electricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Operates 90% of the year We see this happening all over the world for example There is a natural experimental method for more than 40 years Comparing nuclear and solar applications Shows that solar and wind power use is slightly more expensive than nuclear power Generating only half as much nuclear power What does this mean? I think the most significant findings so far are: If Germany had spent $ 580 billion on nuclear energy instead of renewable energy, Now they are 100% electricity and all transportation energy Will be clean energy You may ask a very reasonable question: Is nuclear energy safe? How do you deal with nuclear waste? These are very reasonable questions Here are the results of more than 40 years of scientific research Recent research Was performed by the UK\\'s authoritative medical journal \"Stab tick\" They find nuclear energy to be the safest It's not hard to understand World Health Organization says About 7 million people die from air pollution a year Nuclear energy does not cause air pollution Climate scientist James Hanson calculates So far, nuclear energy has saved nearly two million lives Even wind power is more deadly than nuclear power In this photo are two maintenance workers in the Netherlands Shortly after the photo was taken, one of them fell dead to avoid the fire. The other was engulfed by the fire What about the environmental impact? I think there is a very simple way to understand Uranium is the source of energy for nuclear power plants Its energy density is very high Uranium the size of this magic cube Can produce all the energy you need in your life The conclusion is that such a large area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039land is not required for large-scale power generation You can put the Aventa solar power plant I just mentioned Compared with California's last nuclear power plant, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant To produce the same electricity Solar power plants spend 450 times more land area than nuclear power plants You need to add 17 solar power plants like Aventa Will generate the same amount of power as the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant In addition, solar energy reduces the reliability of power generation What about in terms of raw material collection, scrap and material throughput? This has also been fully studied The results are Solar panels require 17 times more material than nuclear power plants These materials include cement, glass, concrete, metal Fuels for all nuclear power plants are also included In the end, through the entire power generation process Not much waste from nuclear power This room can hold all the waste produced by the Swiss nuclear power project Nuclear waste is the only waste from nuclear power generation It is kept safely without additional social costs Electricity generated by other methods The discharged waste has entered nature These may be pollutants or solid waste We thought solar power was clean But the truth is we have no plans To dispose of waste solar panels after 20 or 25 years Many experts are very worried about solar panels and electronics waste Shipped to poor African or Asian countries together for disassembly Workers will be exposed to a large number of hazardous toxic elements Contains lead, cadmium and chromium Because they are elements, toxicity never degrades I think we all know Nuclear power is really a very powerful energy source Sunlight is scattered and weak This is why we need to have such a large area To collect sunlight and wind In the latest version of \"Blade Runner\" science fiction The beginning is a gloomy post-apocalyptic scene California's desert is completely covered by solar panels No one will be surprised by this scene I think all this makes us can't help but ask a disturbing question: To save the climate, do we destroy the environment? Interestingly, over the past few hundred years Humans are actually trying to eliminate so-called high-density fuels And transfer to high energy density fuels For example, switch from wood and animal manure to coal, oil, natural gas, uranium This is a phenomenon since ancient times Some poor countries are now gradually phasing out wood and dry manure fuel Generally speaking, this is a good thing When you stop using wood as a fuel source Forests have a chance to grow wild animals before they can return to nature When you stop burning wood at home You don't need to inhale these toxic gases anymore When you start using coal, oil, gas and uranium as the main source of energy The potential opportunity to completely eliminate air pollution will emerge There is a problem with nuclear energy Most people readily embrace the conversion from polluting energy to clean energy And converting from low energy density to high energy density energy Nuclear power is very unpopular for many historical reasons As a result, I and many others may have said it in the past \"To address climate change All kinds of clean energy must come in handy. \" The problem is that this is not correct remember? I mentioned France earlier France uses nuclear energy to get most of its electricity If France increases the scale of solar and wind power They have to drastically reduce the amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy The reason is that in order to make the grid able to cope with the variable solar and wind power They need to use more natural gas Think of it this way: Nuclear power plant's power output is difficult to maneuver at any time But the management of the power grid is like controlling the size of the gas fire. Can be switched on and off at any time Oil and gas companies certainly understand this. We all see them investing millions of dollars in recent years to advance solar and wind power This raises another challenging question: Where a lot of nuclear energy is used Nuclear and hydropower provide half of the power grid If we move to other renewable energy sources such as solar energy or wind power, Will actually increase carbon emissions I think the best way is to tell the truth This is what many scientists are doing I mentioned earlier Hundreds of thousands of birds die each year due to fans What I didn't mention is that at least one million bats are killed by fans every year Many bat researchers have proposed such results Especially this gray fluffy bat It is a migratory bat Because those wind turbines are constantly expanding Is facing an extinction crisis Not just wind, but also solar Scientists who were involved in the construction of the Aventa Solar Power Plant And the people who prepared the land in the early stage of execution stood out Some of them wrote: \"Everyone knows that finding a new home for a desert tortoise is impossible When you walk in front of a bulldozer When crying and clearing the animals and cactus It is difficult to agree with this plan. \" And now we can see these phenomena all over the world In my hometown california We buried a lot of natural gas on the side of the mountain To compensate for unstable solar and wind power But an air leak happened The leaked natural gas is equivalent to the exhaust gas emitted by 500,000 cars during their lifetime Recently in Germany Some protesters try to thwart new coal mining plans This will destroy the ancient forest of Hambach Just to get more coal mines It's all about scrapping nuclear power and expanding solar and wind power The good news is People still care about our natural environment and value these phenomena Last year in South Korea Citizens jury weighs these different issues Considered for several months They have to decide whether to scrap nuclear Still want to continue to use and expand the scale 40% of them support the expansion of nuclear power at first After a few months of evaluation 60% of supporters voted in the final vote Just last week, the same phenomenon happened in Arizona Voters vote To decide whether to continue using nuclear energy Or replace nuclear energy with natural gas and solar energy Result refused to scrap nuclear to win 70 to 30 And in Europe we see the Netherlands as one of the first countries to act They announced last week To start increasing the proportion of nuclear power generation Because they recognize that they ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough energy from solar and wind To achieve the promised carbon reduction targets As we become more aware of environmental issues as big as climate change I want to make human civilization and the natural environment harmonious with renewable energy It is a natural tendency to solve problems in this romantic way But I think the truth is right here Many people begin to question past beliefs and change their minds For me, the problem is Now that we know that renewable energy cannot save the planet, Should we continue to destroy her like this? Thank you (applause)", "Jn7VcOU3x2g": "[Music]  January 1910 Halley's Comet is about to return and this time say scientists the earth will pass through its ghostly tail  with each passing week this mysterious visitor becomes an ever bigger story comets have long been linked in people's minds to catastrophes of one kind or another plagues wars the death of kings  even some scientists are concerned a French astronomer I'll read a large warns of dramatic changes in weather and indeed just weeks before Halley's arrival Paris is staggered by the worst flooding it has seen in decades the Lord's colleague Camille Flammarion as an even graver worry [Music] he fears gases in the comet's tail might combine with nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere to produce enough nitrous oxide or laughing gas - cause contagious gaiety paroxysms of the light and in the end widespread madness and death in 1910 comets are almost as mystifying as there were when 17th century British astronomer Edmund Halley realized that one in particular returns to the center of our solar system every 76 years as Halley's namesake approaches the excitement anxiety and business opportunities go [Music] but then when it has come and gone it is science not superstition that claims the day [Music] using newly developed tools scientists gather photographic and spectrographic evidence that proves the comet's tail is too diffused to affect our atmosphere and that it's icy heart is but a tiny fraction of the visible hole as the 20th century dogs there's a growing sense that the mysteries of our universe aren't as far beyond our grasp as we once believed  [Music]  [Music]  in my grandfather's time at the turn of the century the night sky is the greatest show out it plays week after week even on Sundays assuming the weather holds part of its power is its infinite mystery no one knows where stars come from or why they shine few believe we will ever understand what the universe is made of what the true nature of matter really is but then within a few years all hell breaks loose there are revolutions in astronomy and physics and long cherished ideas are shattered about the nature of the universe of space and time and even reality itself the only thing that remains the same is the glory of the view from the moment the telescope is invented it's our window on the universe [Music] in the 18th and 19th centuries ever larger and more elaborate telescopes reveal ever more stars [Music]  by the end of the 19th century telescopes are so large and revealed so many stars astronomers are working overtime just to catalog them there seems little need to build even bigger instruments if all they could do is find more stars to catalogue  but George Ellery Hale disagrees he's passionately convinced a big enough telescope will change astronomy in ways it's impossible to anticipate and he's determined to make that happen [Music] that passion brings him to Mount Wilson in Southern California where the air is almost always free of turbulence and clouds it's the perfect spot for an observatory with funds from the likes of steel tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie Hale sets out in 1908 to build on Mount Wilson the world's largest telescope the instrument he envisions will be almost twice the size of any then in use it will collect and focus lights with a mirror 100 inches wide [Music] Hales enthusiasm is infectious and persuasive it also masks the enormity of the technological challenge he's undertaking nobody is pouring glass mulling glass the size that's going to be necessary nobody is creating the kinds of beams and girders in the superstructure that's going to be necessary these things weigh hundreds of tons thousands of tons you also have the difficulty that they're located on mountaintops you have to build the roads you have to build the living quarters for the astronomers you have to have machine shops on-site it just goes on and on and on these are almost kind of technological kingdoms in their own right and they've never been designed on this scale before  things seemed to go wrong from the start the mirror has to be the largest solid piece of glass ever made a French glass maker pours enough green glass for ten thousand champagne bottles into a huge mold and then packs the whole thing in manure to slowly cool it unfortunately it comes out flawed twice more they try at each time the giant disks crack as they cool lacking the money to try again hail orders his opticians to grind the first in the hope its flaws aren't fatal  it takes four years of grinding and polishing to finish the mirror and even longer to build the rest of the telescope at its dome  hundreds of tons of steel and concrete are hauled up the mountain Road at a cautious 10 miles per hour  even at that speed accidents happen  [Music]  the steel sections of the telescope itself are built at an East Coast shipyard some are so big they must be shipped by boat to California world war 1 has broken out and German submarines are a constant threat long prone to bouts of depression Hales worries about the project begin to affect his health later on he admitted that he had been visited by a companion sort of described as a little green elf who might come to his bed or sit on his shoulder perhaps to give him advice about how to run his life how to raise money who to talk to it's it's hard to say the elf perhaps helped him work out some of this stress  whatever it is that carries Hale through on November 2nd 1917 the 100-inch telescope is finished [Music]  it's 100 tons of iron and steel move with the precision of a fine watch  [Music] it's 9,000 pound mirror and detective candle 5,000 miles away [Music] what Hale has built is one of the marvels of the 20th century it will rain for decades as the best telescope in the world and proved beyond doubt the worth of big telescopes [Music]  to spend a night here is the dream of astronomers the world over you would open the dome a kind of rolling like thunder you are alone on the mountain with the telescope it's just you in the universe are you and God so to speak  you'd sit at the platform at the telescope guiding making very fine adjustments on this magnificent instrument with a little hand paddle with your eye staring down unto the illuminated crosshairs and work there 8 10 12 hours often times it was extremely cold in winter they wore heavy coats sometimes they were bare skin or sheepskin coats you could literally have your tears freeze to the eyepiece and they wanted hot coffee but Hale wouldn't allow it he thought it was poisonous to the system coffee isn't all that Hale keeps off the mountain top in the 1920s I would not have been allowed to work up here in fact I wouldn't have been welcome even as a wife or a visitor of any of the scientists Hale in his days at Yerkes had found that the wives of some of the astronomers became a distraction to their monastic scholarly studies and so they were essentially banned from the mountaintop  ironically without the contribution made by a woman the first great discovery made with the 100-inch might not have been possible the closest a woman could get to the field was at the time at the Harvard College Observatory where major data collecting projects were in progress women were hired on to help to analyze the data to do all the menial tasks that were below the duties of the men  Henrietta Leavitt is one of a dozen women who studied tens of thousands of photographic plates taken by men at distant observatories Levitz task is to examine plates taken at different times and look for stars that vary in brightness she notices a pattern in one class of stars called Cepheid x' and realizes the time it takes them to reach their maximum brightness can be used to determine how far away they are  it's a landmark discovery before Leavitt astronomers couldn't calculate the distance to any but the closest stars what Henrietta Leavitt did was provide one of the first and still to this day one of the most fundamental yardsticks in the universe it is the measure by which all distances are determined without that we'd be clueless [Music] all the astronomers George Hale brings to Mount Wilson will at some point in their careers make use of Levites celestial yardstick but there's one for whom it will have special significance Edwin Hubble a star athlete in college Hubble had won a Rhodes Scholarship and studied law at Oxford University in England upon returning home however he decides against becoming a lawyer and heads off to graduate school to take seriously a fascination with the Stars that he has felt since childhood when Hubble arrives at Mount Wilson in 1919 he's a smart but arrogant 29 year old there was taken pains to adopt what he sees as the proper image of an astronomer what he tries to do is to create this portrait of himself as a kind of natural-born patrician he tries to lose his Missouri roots because I think he's embarrassed about those things he sees the English gentleman as being the prototype of what he wants to become he wears English tweets he wears knickers which have gone out of fashion except on the golf course he smokes a pipe he spoke with an effective British accent he had dueling scars which were said to be self-inflicted but when whispered among the staff [Music] he loves being separate and apart from his fellow human beings and he plays that to the hill  in time most of Hubble's personality quirks are overlooked because he's an excellent astronomer with a gift for asking the right questions  Hubble wants to unlock the secrets of the nebulae faint fuzzy smears of light that have puzzled astronomers for a thousand years  even with Hales magnificent 100-inch their true nature eludes him for four long years [Music]  finally in October of 1923 while photographing one of the spiral arms of the great nebula in Andromeda Hubble catches a break he took a 40 minute photographic plate and developed it the next day and looked at it and thought he saw what was then known as a nova that was another hot topic that is what were nove what were stars that brightened unexpectedly so his curiosity piqued he decided the next night which was a better night to take another exposure and took a deeper photographic plate this plate has what he believes are three novi he had an even greater surprise awaits him well when he got down to the mountain the next day and he began to compare the plates with those that have been taken earlier he discovered that one of the three novi was not in fact a nova but it was a Cepheid and it's a Eureka moment he writes in capital letters on the slide itself var exclamation point for variable star Hubble knows instantly thanks to Henrietta Levitz discovery about Cepheid x' that this star and the system it's a part of must be very far away and the universe must be far larger than anyone had dreamed  Yama's been a good moment for him what he found was that the distance to m31 the Andromeda galaxy one of turns out our nearest neighbors is about two million light-years so people have been talking about the scale of our galaxy 10,000 20,000 30,000 maybe a hundred thousand light-years what this meant was that m31 and all those other galaxies were not part of our system they were themselves big systems equal to the Milky Way  there are in fact billions of galaxies each one containing hundreds of billions of stars Hubble's discovery of the stunning size of the universe and the multitude of stars and star systems that can be found within it changes forever our picture of the cosmos [Music]  that discovery alone would have made Hubble one of the great astronomer x' of the century but he continues to study distant galaxies and makes an even greater discovery  for five years he gathers data on the movements of galaxies recording where they're headed and how fast if a galaxy is moving away its light is stretched the interval between wave crests gets longer the light appears redder the faster is moving the redder the light if a galaxy is moving closer the light is compressed and appears bluer after many years Hubble could sit down and look at this great quantity of information and he plotted a chart he plotted for the nebulae the motions against the distances and he found something truly amazing a straight line he found that the distance of a galaxy is proportional to its velocity so as you go twice as far out turns out the velocities twice as big you know three times as far out the velocities three times as big we live in a world a big world and universe where everything's rushing apart and it's happening in a way we call Hubble's law where the velocity is proportional to the distance an expanding universe how could that be when the whole history of human thought assumed just took for granted that the universe is this fixed thing and how could it change the universe is everything how could it have an evolutionary path because if you had an expanding universe that might mean it had a beginning it might mean it'll end  this is a discovery for the ages [Music]  before Edwin Hubble's discovery even the great physicist Albert Einstein assumed that the universe is fixed at eternal his original equations for general relativity had predicted a changing cosmos but Einstein was unable to believe his own theory so he added what he called a cosmological constant to bring the universe to rest years later in 1931 Einstein travels to Mount Wilson to meet Hubble while there I stand \u00c3\u00a9clairs that his cosmological constant is the greatest blunder of his scientific career of course by this time Einstein can afford to admit to a mistake or two he's already renowned as one of history's greatest scientists the man who redefines gravity space and even time at the age of 22 at the turn of the century Albert Einstein is living in Zurich and facing an uncertain future he dreams of becoming a professor of physics but he can't get a job he has alienated most of his college teachers and they won't give him the recommendations he needs in early 1902 he moves to Bern he's tired of scraping by with what he can earn giving private lessons and a friend's father has offered to help him get a job there it's with the Swiss Patent Office he's a technical clerk third class reviewing applications for patents on new inventions Einstein was a perfect fit for his patent work and those patents that he considered were in my view absolutely formative of his scientific style he'd sit down every day with stacks of documents and his job was to strip away all the complications to take a patent like this and figure out did this violate the basic laws of physics what was it central idea was it that central idea knew or was it something that had been known and those sorts of decisions which he made every day looking at these new devices shaped his sense of how to strip down a physical problem down to its absolute essentials what are the principles it's this same approach that compels Einstein to reexamine fundamental assumptions of classical physics including ideas about space and time that seemed to everyone else inescapable in the early 20th century everyone from physicists to sports fans takes for granted that a mile is a mile no matter where the race is run that the runner who finishes in four and a half minutes is faster than the one who finishes in five [Applause] common sense tells us that time and space are the same everywhere and for everyone indeed that was Isaac Newton starting point when he wrote down his laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century laws that seemed to explain everything from the flight of an arrow to the orbits of planets but Einstein is willing where others are not to question everything even our common sense view of the universe all I have tried to do in my life is ask a few questions could God have created the universe any other way or had he no choice and how would I have made the universe if I had such ants  Einstein is driven to ask such questions by a problem he sees with the traditional description of light he knew from Maxwell's equations from the great classical physics that had preceded him that light could be understood as a wave and that every time you saw a wave of light it was always traveling by you at some enormous ly fast speed like 186,000 miles a second so we were always in the position of somebody say standing on the beach watching a train of waves go by and with any kind of wave that you've ever seen Reinstein had ever seen you could always catch up with it if you went fast enough so you had a bunch of waves going down a canal and you've got on your horse and rode alongside it you'd see the wave just frozen as if as if it was not moving because you'd be moving with it and Einsteins thought to himself is this what if I caught up to a light wave what if I went as fast as light was going would I see it still the way the horseman sees the waves in the canal if he catches up to it and then he thought to himself well that would be such a strange sight it doesn't correspond to anything anyone's ever seen a still wave of light Einstein is convinced that light wouldn't be light if you could catch up to it but in classical physics you can catch up to any wave and light his wave how could it be that there was a wave moving along that you couldn't catch up to he didn't know how to solve the problem he didn't even know how to articulate the problem fully but there was something wrong [Music] children who wonder about things like light time and space are satisfied with the stock answers and never gives them another sword as adults but because I was a late developer I first pondered such simple questions as an adult and so told them more deeply and tenaciously than any child would do [Music] in order to simplify the problem he sees with light Einstein uses a series of thought experiments that take place only in his imagination like a journey on a train [Music] from James Clark and Maxwell's equations we know that the light reflected from my face traveling toward this mirror must move at 186,000 miles per second okay Einstein said but what if the train were moving at the speed of light  one possibility is the train catches up to the light waves so they never reached a mirror but Einstein is convinced this can't happen light can't stand still and what does it mean if I do see my reflection in the mirror well from my point of view everything is just fine but for the person standing outside of the Train there's a problem that person sees the train moving by at 186,000 miles per second and therefore the light reflected from my face traveling toward the mirror must be traveling at twice that rate or 372,000 miles per second three hundred seventy two thousand miles per second is the speed of light added to the speed of the train carrying the light physicists have added speeds this way since the days of Galileo but Einstein concludes this simple adding of velocities is wrong because the speed of light never changes is always 186,000 miles per second even if its source is in motion whether on or off the train you have to get the same measurement for the speed of light the stunning consequence of this is that someone off the train measures rulers on the train as short and clocks on the train as running slow  in a flash of brilliance aya Stein proposes that distance and time are not absolute that a foot and a second mission on the train are not the same as a foot in the second measured off distance and time are relative  fortunately this phenomenon is only noticeable close to the speed of light  imagine yourself alongside early twentieth century science fiction swashbuckler Flash Gordon when not fighting the bad guys we're trying to escape from some monster your dashing around the galaxy at incredible speeds while you are your clock and those back on earth are running at different speeds assuming even gone for the better part of a year when you get back everyone you knew would have been dead thousands of years it's the ultimate example of relative time but Einstein isn't finished quite yet he still has to conjure up the most famous equation of the century e equals MC squared Einstein realized that not only does time slowed down the faster you go he also realized that when objects move they get heavier as they move it was a curiosity why should objects get heavier as they move and then he suddenly realized that the reason why objects get heavier as they move is because the energy of motion is being converted into mass now think about that for a moment the energy of motion is being converted into mass this means that energy is turning into mass and mass is turning into energy and Einstein quickly wrote down it's only one step quickly wrote down the equation that relates energy to matter and it is exactly e equals MC squared Einstein's theory of space and time is called special relativity physicists are intrigued but little changes in Einsteins life with a growing family to support he remains at the Patent Office and moves on to another even greater intellectual challenge special relativity applies to objects moving at constant speed but most movement involves acceleration speeding up or slowing down so Einstein sets out to extend relativity to cover accelerated motion it turns out to be one of the hardest problems any scientist has ever taken on Einstein struggles with it for ten years now most of us physicists will be grappled with a problem that we can't understand we give up and say God is malicious he's a nasty God he's giving his problems that no human can understand my ins I didn't have that philosophy at all he didn't say that God was malicious teasing humans with problems that were beyond human Ken he said God is subtle that only if we are dare to penetrate penetrate into the essence of things then we would find the answer to get to the essence of accelerated motion Einstein once again turns to a thought experiment  imagine this elevator were located in deep space and uniformly accelerating upward with no windows and no connection to the outside world ayan Stein said it would be impossible for us to determine whether or not we're moving but I you might say I feel the pressure on my feet but his response to that would be but how do you determine whether that pressure is caused by the elevator moving upward through space with uniform acceleration or by the elevator simply sitting on the surface of the earth and you're feeling the effects of gravity the fact that you can't tell the difference says Einstein means acceleration and gravity must somehow be the same he concludes after a series of incredibly complex calculations that this is only possible if space and time are curved  according to Einstein's theory of general relativity the curvature of space is caused by the presence of massive objects Newton had it right that a body in motion tends to stay in motion in a straight line the shortest distance between two points but in curved space the shortest distance between two points is a curved line  an object experiences acceleration around the curve as gravity  the Earth orbits the Sun not because of a mysterious force but because the Sun curves the space around it the earth is simply traveling the shortest path through curved space [Music]  Einstein's theory of general relativity perfectly describes the motions of planets stars and galaxies both in space and in time suddenly physics could say something about the fate of the universe it could ask questions about whether the universe as a whole had a certain curvature whether it would come back in on itself whether it would expand out forever general relativity had a scope as infinite as the universe the world is not the same place once you understand these theories space and time are somehow the same thing that's very different from my experience as I would go through life and I can never go back to looking at things the way they were before I understood this theory  [Music] in 1921 Albert Einstein has awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics but it isn't for his work on relativity apparently that's too weird for the awards committee to accept instead in Stein is honored for other contributions including a paper on the nature of light this paper ultimately leads to a second revolution in physics only this time it's too weird for Einstein himself to accept it's called quantum mechanics quantum mechanics comes out of the struggle to understand the structure of atoms what physicists in the early 20th century learn is that in the world of the very small the seemingly impossible is commonplace things don't exist until someone looks at them we're unable to say exactly what path something takes to get from point A to point B uncertainty and chance are woven into the very fabric of existence one of the key figures in the quantum revolution is a young Dane with a tendency to mumble  he's the scientist on the right his name is Niels Bohr and from childhood it's physics that consumes him once while playing goalie in an important soccer game he starts scribbling equations on a goalpost  only the screams on ardent fan snap him out of reverie in time to stop an opposing players potential goal at school he's an excellent student though he seems to have a serious phobia about writing as a graduate student he dictates his entire doctoral dissertation to his mother causing a family fight when his father insists that the budding PhD not to write for himself he never does after his marriage his wife gets the job in 1912 shortly after receiving his doctorate Bohr travels to England he comes to Ernest Rutherford's laboratory just one year after Rutherford makes a startling discovery about atoms atoms had been seen as amorphous blobs of positive charge studded throughout with negative electrons in fact Rutherford says they're more like little planetary systems all the positive charge and virtually all the mass is concentrated in a tiny nucleus around which the electrons orbit like planets around the Sun this is the courtyard at Cambridge University where Rutherford began and ended his scientific career imagine an atom this size if we think of that being the size of an atom then the size of the nucleus would only be one millimeter in diameter that's a bit smaller than this little grain of sand that I've got in my hand here none of us what means these items are essentially empty space now how can we reconcile that with the fact that matter is matter and my hands don't go through one another well that's crazy because if it's mostly empty space they should pass right through one another but what we understand now is in fact that the reason my hands don't go through another is that while the space is empty what it's filled with is really electric fields when the electrons come within a very small distance of each other they begin to repel each other so we have the illusion that things are solid when actually we have this tremendous vacuum given by the fact that the atom is basically empty now this means that I'm not really sitting in this chair at all the Animus of my body are about one angstrom hovering over the atoms of this chair Rutherford's conception of the atom is a breakthrough but almost immediately he finds a paradox at the heart of it see the problem Martha if you've got a nucleus with a positive charge and electrons in orbit about it then we know that the electron should very rapidly orbit into the nucleus it should do it in a fraction of a second that's a very secure prediction of classical physics that's catastrophic what it's telling you is that atoms cannot exist it means that you and I would not exist the atoms would have no way of supporting themselves with large volumes that they have where Niels Bohr arrives in Manchester Rutherford is ready to abandon his model of the atom but Bohr shies away to save it he was so excited he canceled his honeymoon he had to delay his wedding cancel the honeymoon and his poor fiancee instead of going on a luxurious honeymoon had to take dictation as her husband dictated one of the greatest masterpieces in physics because he himself could not get himself to write down the paper what do you oppose the laws that you would not all allow the electrons to move in any orbit about the nucleus as you could according to classical theory but only to occupy certain very well-defined orbits about the nucleus there'll be no but here an orbit here an orbit here but there would not exist all of its between these  there's nothing in between in between exist nothing and that's very non-newtonian if you take the earth and you would you could move the earth a little bit closer to the Sun no problem we'd have a different orbit would be stable we'd have a different time to go around the Sun no problem that you cannot do with an electron around a nucleus you cannot just change the orbit by a little bit you have to change it by so to speak a lot poor's idea that electrons can have only certain orbits draws inspiration from other new theories that suggest heat and light come in units that can't be divided called quanta but applying this quantum idea to matter is practically sacrilegious in fact most physicists disapprove of Bohr's theory whenever they meet they scoff at the idea that an electron can be in some places but not others that matter comes in some sizes but not others if it's not nonsense at least it doesn't make sense this is just a cheap excuse for not knowing what's going on the assumptions are too bold to fantastic that can't be right in time two camps emerged a group around Bohr which believes in his so-called quantum theory of matter and those who cling to the classical view no less than the true picture of nature is at stake in 1926 Verner Heisenberg 25 year old German physicist comes up with a mathematical description of atoms that goes a long way toward legitimizing Bohr's view classical physicists remain unconvinced Heisenberg's mathematical matrices are too complex and the mysterious comings and goings of electrons are just too hard to imagine  within a year an Austrian named Aaron Schrodinger offers an alternative short enger' had his beautiful theory of the electron as a wave it was smeared out over space and time it wasn't a particle at all physicists loved this idea we had a physical picture we could look inside the atom physicists knew how to calculate with waves they calculated waves as an undergraduate in college they knew how waves went around in formed orbits so the appeal of the short enger' picture was that it was pictoral it was almost Newtonian it was continuous none of this quantum business and you could calculate with it  so which is it is mattr made up of waves or particles they seem to be complete opposites waves can pass through one another sometimes cancelling each other sometimes making even bigger waves  put particles on the other hand bounce smash exert force when they meet they can't cancel each other out so these two pictures clashed with each other and they debated and had arguments and they yelled and screamed at each other in fact one day Heisenberg was so worried that he simply came down with hives and and hay fever and tremendous case of allergies worrying about whether or not the rival picture was correct in 1926 Bohr and Heisenberg invite Schrodinger to Bohr's new Institute in Copenhagen to try and work out their differences Heisenberg writes about the visit though Bohr was an unusually considered and obliging person he was able in such a discussion to insist fanatically and risk almost terrifying relentlessness on complete clarity in all arguments he would not give up even after hours of struggling until Schrodinger had admitted that his interpretation was insufficient every attempt from Freudian aside to get round this bitter result was slowly refuted point by point in infinitely laborious discussions  boar's wife nurses Schrodinger when he falls ill from exhaustion she brings him tea and cake even as her husband sits on the edge of the bed continuing the argument still Schrodinger clings to his classical view wearily noting at one point if one has to go on with these damn quantum jumps and I'm sorry I ever started to work on atomic theory the essence of the Bohr Heisenberg picture was that the electron was a particle however there was a certain amount of uncertainty with regards to where the particle was now one day Heisenberg was so paralyzed worrying about all these problems that he took a walk in the park outside his Institute there's a famous park and late at night he walked through the park wondering how can it be how can it be that you don't quite know where the electron is and then in a flash he understood because to understand where an electron is you have to look at it to look at it you have to shine a light on it but when he's trying to light on it that disturbs where the electron is so the very fact of observing an object changes its location therefore he realized that uncertainty is an essential part of his picture Heisenberg calls his insights the uncertainty principle in a clear mathematical way it says the more you know about a particles position the less you can know about its speed and direction the opposite is also true the more you know about a particle speed and direction the less you can know about where it is at any given time and when he finally had that idea he realized that he could merge the Schrodinger picture with the Bohr Heisenberg picture to give us the modern-day theory of the quantum principle in other words the electron is a point particle but you don't know quite where it is and the probability of finding it at any given point is given by a wave the short integer wave so we now have this beautiful synthesis of waves and particles Heisenberg's principle is indeed is very very non-intuitive frankly speaking I call it bizarre but you can see it at work suppose I have a laser beam here and I use laser beam because that's right but I could use any other light for that matter and I make here an opening a slit a vertical slit and here goes the laser beam right through the slit light goes on it goes on and here I project this onto this wall or screen projection screen and what do I see well you see exactly what you predict you see here this laser spots from this beam but now I'm going to make this vertical slit narrower and narrower and narrower what now are you going to see well you going to see exactly what you predict you're going to cut off the edges of the circle and the spot gets narrower and narrower and narrower but now you come to the point that this narrow slit say is only one hundredth of an inch wide and now Heisenberg's principle comes in because now you know so precisely in the horizontal direction where the light is that as it emerges from this slit the direction of the light is no longer determined according to Heisenberg's principle and so now what you're going to see it's going to spread out in the horizontal plane and therefore what you're going to see on this projection screen it's going to get wider extremely non-intuitive because what am i doing I'm making the slit narrower and narrower and narrower and narrower and what do you see ultimately that the beam horizontally becomes wider and wider and wider and wider and wider and wider wider now that is very non-intuitive but it's the way the world works according to the quantum theory even the most bizarre events have a probability of taking place there's a certain probability that I will dissolve and simply ream aterial eyes on the other side of that brick wall now you may say to yourself well well that's impossible we've never seen anyone dissolve and rematerialize on the other side of brick walls but we actually give this problem to our graduate students to our PhD candidates we ask them to calculate using the quantum theory what is the probability that you will find yourself on the other side of a brick wall now to tell you the truth you would have to wait longer than the lifetime of the universe for such an event to take place so you don't have to worry your atoms are not going to dissolve and you're not going to ream aterial eyes on the other side of brick walls but there is a probability you can calculate for that event happening and then you can actually sell the question do I understand it I don't even know what that means understanding I have problems with that physics describes things describes phenomenon and as long as it is predictable as long as that formalism applied in a certain situation gives you the right answer who cares who cares what the meaning is of understanding I think I leave it up to philosophers and I think they'll don't they don't have a clue either of course but they  there are some physicists who refuse to accept that quantum mechanics represents the full story of the subatomic world the most famous is Albert Einstein  quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard but an inner voice tells me that this is not the to Jacob as a seer Lee yields a lot but it hardly brings us any closer to the secret of the old one in any case I am convinced that he doesn't soul dies he couldn't believe that there were big patches of the world about which we could not know and his idea from early on in his life all the way to the end of his life was that there ought to be a set of equations deterministic causal ordered formulated in such a way that they could tell us everything about a future in terms of everything about the present and quantum mechanics wouldn't allow it he couldn't stand that idea [Music] the world's greatest physicists gather in Brussels in 1927 Einstein challenges Bohr and the idea that uncertainty rules the world Werner Heisenberg writes in his diary we all stayed at the same hotel the discussion usually started at breakfast was Einstein serving us up an imaginary experiment by which he thought he had definitely refuted the uncertainty principle in the course of the day we would have discussions on the matter and as a rule by suppertime we would have reached the point where Niels Bohr could prove to Anglin that even his latest experiment failed to shake the uncertainty principle  Einstein would look a bit worried but by next morning he was ready with a new imaginary experiment more complicated than the last one of Einstein's challenges is so clever it has Bohr deeply concerned for the future of quantum mechanics physicist Leon Rosenfeld writes boy did not see the solution I shall never forget the sight of the two antagonists leaving the hall Einstein a tall majestic figure walking quietly with a somewhat ironic smile and Bohr trotting near him very excited  during the whole evening Bohr was extremely unhappy going from one scientist to another trying to persuade them that it couldn't be true that it would be the end of physics if Einstein were right  Bohr spends a sleepless night in his hotel room before he discovers a flaw in Einstein's argument ironically it involves a subtle application of Einstein's own theory of relativity Bohr and Einstein are an astonishing pair in many ways they they loved each other they loved talking to each other they loved engaging with each other's ideas and yet they wanted such utterly different things from physics that they never really could see eye-to-eye God does not throw dice was Einsteins unshakable principle one that he would not allow anybody to challenge to which Bohr could only counter nor is it our business to prescribe to God how he should run the world [Music]  Einstein and Bohr have their last battle about quantum mechanics in 1933 by this time both relativity and quantum theory are almost universally accepted by physicists as the most powerful ideas they have for explaining the world now attention shifts to another challenge figuring out what goes on inside the atom physicists want to know what holds the nucleus together they want to know if protons electrons and the newly discovered neutrons make up everything in the universe what if these particles are made up of something even more fundamental in the process what begins as an intellectual quest turns out to have explosive consequences in the early 1930s Albert Einstein emigrates to America to escape the rising tide of fascism and anti-semitism in Germany [Music] before the decade ends many of Europe's finest scientists are forced to make the same journey  among the last to leave is niels bohr he arrives in the United States in 1939 bringing with him stunning news [Music] in Hitler's Germany two scientists have split an atom of uranium releasing in that moment some of the tremendous energy bound up in matter using simple equipment widely available they produced the first evidence from a controlled experiment of Einstein's famous equation e equals mc-squared I was in Berkeley and people had gone to the meeting in Washington where they were brought his news and they called up and said gosh this is amazing can you do it and in a day or two two or three people had done it I could see the big spikes sufficient on the oscilloscope screen and by the end of the month everybody knew this was going to be your timing device at a super-secret facility deep in New Mexico scrubland the US Army assembles a team of American and transplanted European physicists the greatest collection of scientific talent the world has ever seen  their challenge create an atomic bomb before the enemy  we were galvanized by the no shoe that the Germans were ahead as they expend a lot of money they were very good they're just discovered in Germany they had able people actually didn't realize that they had lost so much by destroying the community as they had done it was lucky  Americans have the talent and practically unlimited resources in less than five years two billion dollars creates a nuclear project the size of the US auto industry  yet until the very end no one can say for sure the product of all this effort will work the basic physics was known the quantum principle was known relativity e equals MC squared was known the chain reaction was known but it was not known how to put it all together so these physicists some of the brightest minds of the world were concentrated at Los Alamos not to discover new physics because that was already done by the Bohr's and by the Einsteins they were assembled to see whether or not it would actually work when I first brought the plutonium sphere in contact with a high explosive I was quite scared about a high explosive and Roger Warner who was in charge of that particular assembly he was calm and he said don't worry about that you can't run very far in a millisecond anyhow so you'll never know what happens if it goes off wrongly  it was a new world everyone could see that maybe they'll be doing end of the war that was very good but who knows was gonna come after that we didn't know I should have no more than we did but we didn't  it was a fantastic experience of taking theory theories that were equations and building something of enormous power the power of the Sun but just like the opening of Pandora's box perhaps humanity was not ready for a cosmic fire perhaps humanity was not mature enough to handle the power of the Sun now being placed on the earth  [Music]  [Music]  there's a universe up there that we can't see with our eyes even if we have something a thousand times larger than this we have to turn to a different kind of telescope well without lenses or mirrors or any of the other things astronomers have relied upon for centuries this invisible universe has to be seen with telescopes that use radio waves x-rays infrared rays or gamma rays everything in the universe gives off radiation of some kind for example the glaze on this teacup emits gamma waves imagine that it is a galaxy and this geiger multi to a crude ray telescope in the second half of the 20th century astronomers start exploring the heavens with instruments that are sensitive to a number of different forms of radiation when they do it's like lifting a veil from the face of the universe one of the most surprising discoveries of post-war astronomy is made with this device built outside Cambridge England it may look like four and a half acres of laundry line but it's really a radio telescope  as the Earth rotates miles of antenna wire receive radio signals day and night  when it goes into operation in 1967 Jocelyn Bell gets the task of running it within months the young graduate student notices something she's never seen before it's a funny blip on one of the long rolls of chart paper used to record what the telescope sees the first few times I saw it I just put a question mark by it and passed on but I think the human brain stores problems I think mine does anyway things that it can't resolve things that I can't cope with because this curious little signal occupied about a quarter of an inch in 400-foot and yet somehow my brain stored that way way back somewhere but it stored it and after it had dealt with this problem a couple of times and it faced at the third time it said something like this before  she immediately calls her thesis advisor radio astronomer Anthony Hewish he's intrigued but cautions the signal was probably man-made  Bell goes back to her charts and figures out when the signal should come again  she sets her instruments to record a more detailed image and discovers the signal is a string of pulses exactly one and a third seconds apart never before has a telescope of any kind found something like this it's a complete mystery heavenly bodies don't just pulse on and off  look at the Sun the Sun doing this look at the moon it says soon moon doing this look at all the stars in the sky look at them would you naked I have you ever seen one go nothing right and one way out it didn't explain everything but one way out was to say well maybe it's little green men sending a signal to us [Music] I think they were totally shocked shell-shocked that this possibility existed they realize it would be the discovery of the century if we get in touch somehow receive signals from civilizations what do you do if you have really picked up signals from another civilization do you tell the president the press or the Pope first  before they can tell anyone anything bill finds what could be a second signal she heads out to the antenna on a cold November night to check it out I came out on my scooter slithering all over the place on the ice and when I got here the machinery wasn't working properly because of the cold but I flicked switches I kicked it I cursed as I breathed hot air on it and I got it to work for five minutes and it was the right five minutes and it was the right setting so as it was looking at the right bit of sky and then came poop poop poop poop very like the first lot but not totally the same a little bit different one and a quarter seconds I said at one over third and that settles the little green man question because it's so unlikely there'll be to lots of little green men opposite sides of the sky both deciding to signal to an inconspicuous planet and using a not very intelligent way of doing it also so it had to be something stellar the news of bells pulsing stars spreads rapidly through the astrophysics community it is clearly an important discovery what they are and how they pulse is a real mystery so if you take a large object collapsing it rotates enough and you go back to the old argument perhaps it's a whiteboard perhaps the residues finally a physicist connects what Bell has found with an old theory about the death throes of stars  this theory long assumed to be untestable predicts that when a large enough star runs out of nuclear fuel it will collapse and crush the atoms within it  what's left is like nothing else in the universe an incredibly dense object made almost entirely of neutrons every open space that you can think of between electrons in the atoms is squeezed out and it becomes one huge nucleus and the electrons are pushed into the protons forming neutrons that's why we call them neutron stars a neutron star has typically a radius of about 10 kilometers six miles but the amount of matter in a nucleon star is a little bit more than the total mass the total metal do we have in the Sun a spoonful of this neutron star matter would weigh if you like the word weighing in pounds it's 2 times 10 to the 11 it's a 2 with 11 zeros pounds in one spoonful  neutron stars can rotate up to 700 times a second as they do their powerful magnetic fields ripped through space blasting radio waves outward like a galactic lighthouse it's that beacon that Jocelyn Bell sees with her radio telescope  [Music]  theory had said that neutron stars are possible but for decades astronomers and physicists clung to the view that they're just too weird to be real bells discovery is dramatic confirmation that the universe is stranger and more fantastic than anything we experience in our corner of the cosmos [Music] the reality of neutron stars stirs excitement that black holes may also be real they are perhaps the most fantastic and unlikely prediction ever made by physicists  World War one had just broken out when Albert Einstein publishes his general theory of relativity among those fighting on the Russian front is a German astronomer and physicist named Karl Schwarzschild with the war raging around him Schwartz child discovers that Einstein's equations predict the existence of a star so unimaginably dense that even light cannot escape it from the battlefield he sends Einstein his calculations just weeks after receiving Einstein's reply Schwarzschild dies on the front lines  Einstein marvels at Schwartz tiles work but he never accepts that such a star could really exist as he puts it it just doesn't smell right [Music] through the 1960s most scientists agree with Einstein but the public is completely taken with the idea of a Dark Star in which Escape is impossible where time that space ceased to exist  [Music] Zen put forward coordinate eight nine zero on visual confirmed that is nothing there Zen use long-range intensifier three guesses if you need them a black hole my god we're falling into a black hole [Music] the existence of a real black hole is almost impossible for physicists to accept yet many have to admit that the process that creates neutron stars should also create black holes when a star has burned up all its nuclear fuel and there is no longer heat that pushes it out that the core collapses and it can form a neutron star this collapse can be so strong depending upon the original mass of the star that it overshoots and doesn't become a neutron star but become even smaller and then it can become a black hole if you take the earth to give you an example and you take advice if you could make vice and you squeeze the earth the earth has a radius of 6,400 kilometers if you could make the radius 3 centimeters the earth would become a black hole 3 centimeters this big then it would automatically further collapse onto itself nothing could stop it and it will become a black hole and you could never lie to could never leave it radio waves could not leave it because they all go with the speed of light [Music]  finding something that doesn't give off light or any other kind of radiation is tricky to say the least it's not until the early 70s that astronomers stumble on the first indirect evidence of a black hole the first clue comes when x-ray telescopes reveal an area of intense violence and temperature in the constellation Cygnus Paul Verdun is one of many astronomers who begin to focus on this area working with Louise Webster he finds a supergiant star orbiting something they can't see logically the supergiant must be circling a much smaller and denser star one so dense it's gravity is sucking huge amounts of matter from its larger companion only this could produce the intense x-rays other astronomers had detected  further measurements reveal the small stars gravity must be greater than anything discovered before the only explanation is a black hole  [Music] there is still no absolute proof that black holes exist but from the 1970s on most scientists have come to accept them as real incredibly strange but real whether there is a neutron star at least you can imagine it has a surface and you can land on that surface and okay it is a mind boggling magnetic field alright but so be it it's there and okay it rotates 700 times per second but a black hole has no surface so you can't even talk about a surface that rotates around it doesn't exist and there is no time that you can define that's pretty bizarre that goes beyond totally beyond my imagination I'll be very honest with you but yet it's one of my specialties I measured them I find them can I envision them now current theory holds that there are billions of black holes in the universe including enormous ones at the center of most galaxies [Music] these are so large they must have devoured millions perhaps even billions of stars [Music] but even the birth and growth of black holes are nearly as fantastic as the creation of the universe itself  for most of human existence the question of how everything began is one that only religion dared to answer but with Edwin Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding some scientists begin to believe that they too might have something to offer their reasoning goes something like this if the universe is expanding then in the past it must have been smaller go far enough back and everything must have been crunched together at a point of infinite density our universe began they suggest when that point exploded creating the expansion we still see today this vision comes to be called the Big Bang theory of creation at the start of the 1960s scientists are equally divided between this Big Bang Theory and a competing notion that the universe is eternal called the steady-state theory but there's no real Parden evidence for either one in fact almost no one expects the debate will ever be resolved in the early 60s Robert Dicke an astrophysicist at Princeton University comes up with what he thinks is a way to test whether or not the universe started with a big bang he's convinced that it had happened the entire universe should be filled with radiation left from the moment of creation Bob Nikki's reasoning was quite interesting he reasoned that if the universe had gone through this Big Bang phase it must have been very hot and very dense and there must have been a lot of heat radiation very high temperature and he couldn't find any theoretical way to get rid of this radiation it must still be around it's cooled off because the universe expanded but it must still be around and in the microwave band and where radar works it's a truly amazing possibility 15 billion year old heat transformed by the expansion of space into low-level radio static that permeates every corner of the universe if it's there the only cosmological theory that can explain how it got there is the Big Bang Dickie convinces David Wilkinson and another young physicist to build an antenna and search for this cosmic background radiation we weren't in any particular hurry because Bob Dickies idea was so original we weren't too worried about somebody else getting there before we did so we charged ahead rather slowly we had knowing no microwave equipment at all we had to order things new we went down to Arch Street in Philadelphia and dug around in the World War two surplus shops to find things that were cheap Bob Dicke is a rather a frugal experimentalist so if we could find it in the junk shop we did that  this is the antenna that resulted it's carefully calibrated using super cold helium while Wilkinson is building it to other scientists just 30 miles away are setting up an experiment that seems to have nothing to do with the Big Bang  with colleague Arno Penzias Bob Wilson plans to use this microwave antenna to study our galaxy he's unaware of Dickies idea in fact he doesn't believe in the Big Bang but prefers a universe with no beginning or end I like the steady-state is philosophically satisfying because there's no end to the universe in the future it goes on forever in the same sort of state that it is and there's no beginning for it either so physicists generally like steady-state because they don't like to have to have a time beyond which they can't know anything Wilson and Penzias are then just getting started on their scientific careers we have no desire to confront a problem as difficult as whether or not the universe had a beginning they just want to make some small contribution to astronomy doing science by ourselves was a great new adventure we've sort of had a chance at Bell Labs to become scientists you know in the real sense and make use of this unique instrument and we really devoted ourselves to it Wilson and Penzias believe the Holmdel antenna will make a great radio telescope because it's designed to reject all extraneous signals or noise but for the very first time they use it extraneous noise is exactly what it seems to be picking up every time we started up we saw the same noise level everywhere in the sky we pointed we saw the same noise level it isn't a lot of noise but they fear it's enough to compromise some of their research so they decide to find out what's causing it and get rid of it they check to see if it's there at night they check to see if it's there in different seasons they check all possible ground-based sources of radio noise they check the antenna itself and tape all its joints they double-check every piece of equipment in the system and the noise is always there with few alternatives left to try they decide to check a real long shot a set of pigeons had started roosting up in the throat of the thing and of course they'd coated it with the same white pigeon droppings that you see on statues and so forth in the city we got a ladder from the carpenters and a couple of push brooms and some scrub brushes and scraped off the difficult ones and swept the whole thing out  they check again and realized they could have left the pigeons alone a year of this struggle has left them convinced the antenna is fine the only possibility left and it doesn't make sense is that every corner of the universe is filled with the same noise desperate they begin calling other astronomers for help and one suggests calling Bob Dicke in the phone rang and Bob picked it up and it was two guys from Bell Labs who had a problem which at first didn't seem to have anything to do with us we didn't learn very much on the telephone but they agreed to come out and see what we had done and tell us about what they had in mind he hung up the phone and I'll never forget exactly what he said these are his exact words he said well boys we've been scooped Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias had already heard the echo of the Big Bang their annoying background noise was in fact nothing less than a whisper from creation itself  in the beginning some 15 billion years ago the universe exploded from a single point [Music] less than one minute later it's a million billion miles across though cooling rapidly it still has an average temperature of a billion degrees  the universe continues to expand and cool gradually gravity draws together atoms and then clumps of atoms it takes a billion years before stars form and galaxies are created [Music] eventually around some of the stars planets form and on at least one life begins [Music]  if everything in the universe began in a single point it's hard not to wonder what it took to go from such ultimate simplicity to all of this many physicists believe that at the beginning of time there was only a single particle governed by a single force from that starting point within a tiny fraction of a second particles like protons and electrons evolved and forces like gravity and magnetism came into being but did the universe have to be like this could have turned out any other way perhaps if we can work back to the moment of creation that an ultimate particle and force we will come to understand why the universe is the way it is and even to express it in what fizzes is called the final theory which its hopes can be captured in a single equation that can fit on a t-shirt this may explain everything when we look at nature we see the complexities the differences among things but scientists tend to look for the connections the simplicity that lies at the heart of it all  the more you learn about nature the simpler it looks and that's why I think we will find a final theory because although I can imagine things getting infinitely more complicated complication without end I can't imagine simplicity without end the whole progress of physics has been toward and more and more simple description of nature and how simple can things get and simplicity must finally terminate there must be something so simple that we can't imagine anything more simple but in the years following World War two physicists are stunned to find their dream of ultimate simplicity slipping away experiments meant to reveal simplicity find ever greater complexity  California home of the bevatron the BB stands for billions of electron volts world's most powerful atom smashers it's the beginning of the era of big science giant atom smashers are built to accelerate subatomic particles to fantastic speeds and smash them into other atoms each new accelerator built after the war was more powerful than the one that came before each was able to ram particles into each other harder and to show what was happening at a smaller and smaller scale it was just like the telescope's with each new telescope that was built you could see further out into space gather more light resolve objects more precisely with each new accelerator people were able to see deeper into matter more precisely better resolution smaller scale photographs of the tracks of the objects produced in these accelerators reveal a multitude of new particles that seemed just as fundamental as the familiar proton Neutron and electron we were literally drowning in subatomic particles one year out of sheer frustration J robert Oppenheimer father of the atomic bomb stated that the physicist who does not discover a new particle that year should win the Nobel Prize in Physics there were hundreds and hundreds of particles which looked just as elementary as the proton it became clear that if elementary meant anything either there was something more elementary inside these particles or perhaps they were all elementary a frightening idea among the physicists unhappy with all this complication is a brash young theorist named Murray gell-mann by the age of 25 Gelman is already well-known in the world of physics for his encyclopedic interests and knowledge his quick and creative mind and his frequently abrasive personal style a  colleague says of him Murray has no particular talent for physics but he's so smart he's a great physicist anyway the important thing is first to steep yourself in the problem to look at the puzzle all the pieces of the puzzle by looking for patterns and symmetries Gelman finds a way to organize all the newly discovered particles into families  then inspired by a chance encounter during a visit to Columbia University in New York he takes a giant step towards simplicity over lunch a physicist approached him and said isn't it possible that your theories could be explained by postulating three even more fundamental particles well everyone at that table dismissed that idea immediately and they patiently explained to this physicist what was wrong you would have fractionally charged particles an outrageous ridiculous idea because everyone knew that particles were either plus 1 or minus 1 in charge never one-third or two-thirds but over the months that follow yelman grows to love the idea of this deeper level of reality the fact no one's ever seen particles this bizarre he decides isn't his problem  in early 1964 Gelman proposes to the world the existence of three new fundamental entities he calls quarks his three quarks could combine in different ways to reproduce the properties of this enormous particles ooh it would simplify organize predict it was a great scientific advance the problem was that no one had ever seen anything that looked like a quark are they actually real object well my experimental friends are making a search for them in all sorts of places one atomic spectroscopy was friend of mine calls me up sometimes at midnight to report his progress in a search for Forks in seawater most things with curious chemical behavior in the ocean end up by and so now he's grinding a boy stirs physicists were faced with the paradox where were the quarks everywhere we looked we could not find any physical evidence for the quarks and in fact some physicists even began to doubt the correctness of the theory however over the years indirect evidence began to trickle in confirming this theory and now when experimenters take a hard look at the proton they see strong evidence of the quarks inside and also quarks may be real but they're still pretty strange for starters they're so small it's hard to apply to them our normal notions of size physicists describe them as points points come on mean points how can something have a mass and a charge and be a point well it takes a little a few muscles in the mine and haven't been worked down but if you work on them for a while you can imagine such an object it's a little bit like Allisyn what Nolan remember the Chesser cat sitting on the tree smiling and Alice's noticing that the cat is disappearing in front of her eyes and poof when the cat this appears the smile is left behind you remember that well in a way you can look at that as you take take a cork and it's spinning and it has a spherical if you like and it has mass and charge and spin and all these other properties that we like to measure about it but it in front of your eyes it's shrinking and finally it to shrinks to a point leaving behind its spin its charge its mass and if it has a smile if you think of the eye that's smile that's the idea of point particles  with quarks physics journey into the heart of matter takes a giant step toward its goal of finding an ultimate particle from which everything is made instead of hundreds of fundamental particles in nature now there are simply three electrons quarks and neutrinos tiny particles with almost no mass that rarely interact with the stuff were made of [Music]  the search for a single fundamental particle is matched by the search for a single force that governs the behavior of everything  this was Albert Einstein's great quest for the last 25 years of his life more than once he thought he had done it only to learn his solution was fatally flawed  when Einstein was working on unification he recognized two forces gravity and electromagnetism but today physicists have to deal with two others the strong force and the weak force the weak force is responsible for many forms of radioactivity the strong force holds our nucleus together the nucleus is full of protons which all have positive charges and if there was nothing to hold them together the electric forces would make them fly apart because equal charges I repelled the strong force prevents that from happening one of the physicists who plays a key role in their quest for unification is Steven Weinberg specialty is the two forces within the atomic nucleus the weak and the strong like a lot of other physicists I got started with chemistry around I had a hand-me-down chemistry set that was given to me by an older cousin first I just like to play with the powders and the liquids and make colored smoke and things like that and gradually just reading about it I became aware that what went on inside an atom was something that couldn't be explained in terms of ordinary things that I knew about in everyday life and I got the feeling there was something strange and wonderful about physics which was the science that governed what goes on inside atoms that feeling about physics stays with Weinberg through college and grad school [Music] in the late 60s he's struggling unsuccessfully to use certain mathematical ideas to make sense of the strong force the one that holds atomic nuclei together and then at a certain point I think when I was driving my car to MIT I realized my goodness this kind of mathematical idea although it's a complete loser as far as the strong forces are concerned is just what we need to make a theory of the weak force and to my surprise although certainly not my disappointment what came out at the end was not just a theory of the weak forces but inevitably a unified theory of weak and electromagnetic forces all of a sudden from four fundamental forces we now had three fundamental forces and this changed the entire terrain of theoretical physics in order to test Weinberg's theory the European community spends a staggering 150 million dollars to modify and make more powerful its largest particle accelerator the protons are in the machine we're now in the countdown  in the subatomic shrapnel created in these collisions lies the evidence that confirms the correctness of the electroweak unification the four fundamental forces are now three but just as three types of particles doesn't satisfy neither does three forces in the mid-1980s work begins on what most physicists believe is the key to getting even closer to the heart of matter it's called the superconducting supercollider or SSC  with an underground particle ring 50 miles long it's designed to recreate the conditions of the universe in its first trillion trillion trillionth of a second it was to be a device so large it would enclose towns inside it it was a machine that would require buses to get from one part to another it was a machine that would ship volumes of data equivalent to the entire Library of Congress out to distant laboratories around the world with amazing frequency the detectors the sites where the actual physics would be conducted would cost a billion dollars apiece and have somewhere near a thousand physicists and probably an equivalent number of technicians at each one but in 1993 after an investment of two billion dollars construction on the SSC is halted years of escalating costs have eroded congressional support the message to scientists is find another way to hunt for the ultimate particle and the ultimate force physicists are devastated  when the American particle physics community gambled on the SSC they had essentially to shut down program after program in the hopes that they could convince the politicians that by making these sacrifices they should receive the amount of funds necessary to build the superconducting supercollider when this SSC was cancelled they essentially lost everything even still the search for unification goes on in the 1980s theorists propose that at the heart of everything are infinitesimally small vibrating strings string theory quite simply is the most exciting idea to hit physics since the days of Einstein and Bohr it may well be the final theory the one that explains absolutely everything [Music] the pythagorean's believed that music was the language of nature that their harmonies on a violin string which they worked out for the first time in history were the harmonies of the universe and they thought that all around this surrounding us was music the music of the spheres unfortunately that idea never got anywhere because that couldn't explain the elements now we think that if I have a super powerful microscope and could peer into an electron I would see a vibrating violin string and when that note changes it changes into a quark it changes into gravity it changes into light so in other words our bodies are nothing but collections of strings and the laws governing these strings are the harmonies of the strings and they are the laws of physics  theorists usually imagine strings as incredibly small closed loops more like rubber bands than anything else ordinary matter even space time and energy are nothing more than the vibrations of strings to physicists they are beautiful elegant simple everything they dream about but the mathematics needed to describe them is anything but  super symmetric definition of an index and the statement is that the topology of the super space can only be generated by the topology of the bosonic manifold mathematics or theoretical physicists really is an extra sensory organ I cannot make myself as small as an atom I cannot make myself the size of a proton but with mathematics I have an accurate representation of that and then I can use my mind to actually look at those small things one of the strangest things about string theory is that it only works if there are ten or more dimensions some people say to us but that's not common sensical that violates common sense well why should common sense have anything to do with the universe why should the universe care about your common sense so we physicists are prisoners we are prisoners of experiment prisoners of our mathematics and we simply go where the mathematics go where the experiments take us with string theory they're going way out there using mathematics in a way that physicists have never use mathematics before in ten dimensions we can look at the entire Clifford algebra of the direct matrices they're becoming more and more mathematical more and more esoteric unfortunately and most unfortunately evolved further and further removed from experimental verification but in a sense it's the only game in town it's the only hope we have of unifying everything but we are talking about now is understanding all four from mental forces that's the power of this theory we're talking about a theory of the universe will it give me better color television the answer is no it's not going to give you a bigger toaster it's not going to give you better sliced bread but it will give you is a theory that will affect the core the future course of human civilization your great-great-great grandchildren well one day live to harness the power of the unified field theory no one knows if the string theory is the final theory but if it isn't physicists are sure to keep searching  I think it's almost a religious belief that things must somehow very deep down be simple and that we are to some degree blind and don't see this simplicity but our searching for it now that's what physics has been doing always very difficult process he's very difficult phenomenon which seemingly are unrelated chaotic through simple descriptions pull them together and unify them and that will go on for a long long time  astronomers will also keep trying to solve the mysteries of the universe on a mountain in Arizona one team of scientists is searching the sky for clues to the ultimate fate of the cosmos  at this and other telescopes around the world they're measuring lights from stars halfway across the universe then Bob Kirchner and his colleagues will use those measurements with Einstein's equations to calculate the approximate mass of the entire cosmos  this is not easy  no supposed to do except just sit there and take it if Krishna finds enough mass it means the universe will one day stop expanding and will collapse back upon itself in what astronomers call the Big Crunch  if he finds less than that amount the universe will expand forever into virtual nothingness  the actual measuring and so it's very laborious and it's slow and you sit there and it takes all night for these photons to dribble in but the thing that makes it exciting you've been thrilling in a kind of quiet way is that we're after a big question we're really after a question that people been interested in for a long time ever since they could kind of frame the question what is the fate of the universe is it going to last forever how will things end these are big questions and we're really on a path that could give us a concrete answer in the context of how we understand the universe today of which of those possibilities is really the right one so that's a lot of fun and it keeps you awake at night [Music]  calculating the total mass of the universe will also shed light on what may be the biggest question facing 21st century astronomy the mystery of dark matter that's matter we can't see but we know must be out there because we've measured its gravitational effect other things we can see [Music]  telescopes as disparate as the newly refurbished 100-inch the George Hale built atop Mount Wilson to the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around the earth we'll all be enlisted in the years to come in the search for clues about dark matter [Music] theorists believe 99% of the mass of the universe is invisible to telescopes if that's the case it's like a modern Copernican revolution Mike Copernicus told us that the earth wasn't the center of the universe ok then we learned indeed that the Sun was in the center of the universe and our galaxy isn't the center of the universe now we're learning that this dark matter which may be made of stuff which is completely different than anything we see on earth is the dominant stuff of creation that means if you took away you and me and the Stars and everything we see in the universe the real universe would still be there [Music]  twentieth century physicists and astronomers have shown us the universe more amazing than we ever suspected and a reality stranger than we ever dreamed and the future promises to dazzle us even more  as Albert Einstein wrote many years ago the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true science [Music] a", "N6zqatiur3A": "Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.

The first 10 years of my starting CNN, I slept on my couch, I didn't have an apartment. Bill Gates slept in the office, Steve Jobs slept in the office and I can go down a whole list. Now these are super successful mega-wealthy guys. I slept in my office, not everybody is willing to make that sacrifice. But it's not the only thing but even if you don't want to sleep in your office, if you want to send your kids to a better school, if you want to be able to take care of your mother when she gets dementia, if you want to... this all takes money.

He said, the best thing that you can have for a child is him to be born into poverty. And I agree. Lack of self-esteem, lack of self-worth. Now they think they have self-worth, they think because they made a few bucks but in actuality, and when they measure it against the other 8, 10, 12 people sitting around the table they realize or they start the question \"Hell, maybe I was just lucky.\" Now all of us, when you're only a one-trick guy or gal think, \"Was I lucky?\" Now I've done it so many times, I know I wasn't lucky I might have been lucky the first time but I haven't been lucky the 15, 20, 40, 50, - I know that. - Okay But maybe I was lucky the first time.

what will you see if you got close and they'll pass the point of no return into another world of twisted space and time  what secrets can we learn about the universe on a journey to the center of a monster black hole  [Music] imagine traveling to the very center of our galaxy 26,000 light-years away  and finding a vantage point on the night sky you'd see millions of stars and on the horizon a strange dark sphere rising it's a black hole and objects so dense nothing can escape its gravitational pull not even light  this monster is ten times the size of our Sun yet millions of times heavier it's not the only one out there in nearly every large galaxy astronomers have found evidence of black holes millions even billions of times the mass of the Sun how did they form and how did they get so large in the search for answers we are beginning to glimpse the forces that shape the Stars planet even life  and now by tracing the lifecycle of black holes scientists are finding clues to the fate that awaits all of galaxy and the universe at large but how do you study something that by nature evades detection sometimes the universe lets us in on its most mysterious workings March 19 2008 astronomers around the world receive an alert sent from an orbiting Observatory called Swift it had recorded a flash of gamma radiation a kind of ultra high-energy light that is the signature of a cataclysmic event swift automatically relayed the information down to earth and within seconds robotic telescopes in North and South America turn their gaze on the rising light  astronomers dial into the data to see how bright and powerful the flash had become meanwhile at giant observatories in Chile and in Texas they zero in on it using specialized instruments to split the light into all its different wavelengths  that tells them how far the light have traveled to reach earth what they find is that it had come from seven and a half billion light-years away halfway across the visible universe  Tom vest Rand heads a robotic telescope project at the Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico he's been tracking high-energy gamma-ray bursts for over a decade and has never seen anything like this he was the most luminous thing ever detected by mankind traditionally think of astronomy as something that happens very slowly but this was a thing that had been traveling to us for 7.5 billion years arrived here and for 30 seconds it was astonishingly bright amazingly bright minutes later meaning still showing signs of saturation it was so bright in fact that it was visible to the naked eye putting together evidence from ground and space telescopes astronomers determined that the flash was a narrow but intense beam of light and it most likely it broadcast the birth of a black hole  this singular moment is the endpoint of a violent chain of events in the core of a large star  all stars shine by burning light elements like hydrogen in the largest ones intense heat uses these elements into heavier ones like carbon silicon and finally iron like hot air in a balloon heat and light from these nuclear fires creates an outward pressure that prevents the Stars massive outer layers from collapsing inward  eventually that fuel runs out the energy flows out through the star off into space it can't go on forever when the fuel runs out the star starts to shrink and when that iron core builds up to about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun it can no longer hold itself up against the pressure and it will collapse in some cases as matter slams into the star's core the impact creates a powerful shockwave that races back out and literally blows the star apart [Music]  our galaxy is littered with the scattered remains of these supernovae as shown in images like these from the hubble space telescope but what happens to the collapsed core of these dead stars when a large star implodes its weight is enough to squash all the atoms in its core down to their nuclei the result an ultra dense ember called a neutron star the density of a neutron star something like taking a mountain and pushing it down to the size of Mobb about so big neutrons can withstand incredible pressures but if enough matter falls onto them beyond a critical threshold they can be crushed down to nothing  when that happens a black hole is born  a black hole is gravity taken to the extreme its mass is literally packed into a point and enshrouded within a dark sphere called the event horizon that sphere is the point of no return any gas stars or planets that fall in disappear forever a black hole is a region of space and time which is both black and empty it's black because light can't escape from it gravity pulls the light back but it's empty because the object or system that collapsed to form it in the first place is shriveled away to nothing the common idea that the black hole has just made of very compacted matter it's wrong it's just simply wrong it may have been created from very compacted matter but the matter is gone it's been completely destroyed it no longer exists  and yet it leaves behind a powerful legacy it's gravity  according to Albert Einstein gravity is not just the attractive force of planets and Suns [Music] it's a warping of space and time what scientists call space-time in the presence of massive objects a planet for example goes into orbit when it's caught in the Warped space surrounding a star like a ball spinning around a roulette wheel [Music] with the mass of a star squashed down to a point a black hole is a deep puncture in space-time when a black hole is born the energy gets transformed from the energy of the matter to the energy of warp space-time so it's a transformation of the form of the energy from one to another but the energy is still concerned what you're left behind with is warp space-time that has a huge amount of energy in it with that energy a black hole can affect its environment in profound ways on our planet Earth we know gravity is the force that brings everything down the impact releases energy a crash  a thud a shatter  [Music] when matter falls toward a black hole the energy released can reach astronomical proportions when we look at how they affect the rest of the universe we look at what happens around them what happens when stuff exploits this huge gravitational potential this huge gravitational hole that they form and how that is exploited to make energy  such energy emissions are part of a growing body of evidence that black holes famous for hiding in the dark have a history of outbursts that have reached across the cosmos and shaped the universe we know  scientists are following this energy like a trail of clues leading ever closer to the black hole's dark heart  astronomers once saw black holes as rare and exotic in a universe seemingly dominated by stars and galaxies  a radically new view has emerged from surveys of galaxies and black holes stretching deep into the universe  giant black holes lurk in the dust lanes and swirling gas clouds at the Centers of nearly every large galaxy what's more the larger the galaxy the larger the black hole that's a clue that they must have evolved hand in hand each shaping the life story of the other  to find out the role black holes played in the evolution of the universe astronomers are trying to recreate this shared history with what amounts to a whole new branch of science they are using supercomputers to simulate the sweep of cosmic history including that of galaxies like our own [Music]  this simulation takes us back to just a few hundred million years after the beginning of the universe gravity through vast pockets of gas into dense centers they grew hotter and hotter igniting to become the first generation of stars these stars lived hot and fast and in only a few million years some blew up in powerful supernova  from these stars likely came the first generation of black holes cosmologists Tiziana DiMatteo is part of a wider effort to see what marked these early black holes left on the universe her computer program simulates the action of gravity on gas the formation of stars galaxies and black holes her goal is to create a virtual universe that evolves like the real one did with black holes and galaxies emerging and growing together  our Milky Way galaxy is located in a quiet part of the universe with relatively few other galaxies around it move out across the cosmic void 50 million light years away and you encountered the great Virgo cluster filled with thousands of galaxies recent telescope surveys show that this region is part of a larger pattern of galaxies resembling a vast spider's web to get her virtual universe to look like this Tiziana needs to know what cosmic conditions gave rise to black holes and galaxies in the first place so it's a beautiful problem because we start from extremely well specified initial conditions we know the initial condition of the universe and that's very rare in astrophysics in cosmology and you know in any branch of physics details of what the universe was like in its earliest times have come courtesy of a breakthrough Observatory called W map it found a blotchy pattern in a kind of radiation generated soon after the Big Bang astronomers believe this pattern is the origin of a spider's web structure they see in their telescopes it defines the beginning point of Tiziana simulation on top of that now we need to put the right physics in order to play these initial conditions evolve them and make the universe the way it looks like today she sets her virtual universe in motion it covers a region in the shape of a cube over a hundred million light years on a side the result an intricate cosmic web with gravity drawing matter into filaments and knots on the largest of scales in places where filaments come together galaxies and black holes first begin to appear all the matter that is coming in from the large scale will also allow the black hole to to grow because of this gas is being transported from a large scale all the way into the galaxies and the galaxies all the way into the center and therefore feeding and growing this central black holes at a very high rate  in this sequence drawn from her simulation the circles indicate the appearance of black holes within the data [Music] what she finds is that as these black holes gain mass gravity pulls them toward the densest regions where if you grow larger than all the rest how did these chosen few black holes grow so rapidly the orbiting Chandra x-ray Observatory recently turned up evidence at the Centers of galaxies back in the time of the early universe these images show it's remarkable find actual supermassive black hole pairs beginning what astronomers believe is a dance of death  in most cases their forward momentum simply causes them to go into orbit around each other like a planet around the Sun this orbit can go on for billions of years to grow large one black hole must draw the other in close enough to swallow it  Albert Einstein showed how they do it he predicted that when massive bodies accelerate or whip around each other they can stir up the normally smooth fabric of space-time [Music] it's like a rock hitting a pond some of the energy of the impact is transferred to waves that move outward along the surface likewise a Titanic collision of black holes would send waves gravity waves racing across the universe so you have two tornadoes embedded in a third larger tornado and they're going to come crashing together and you want to know what happens when these tornadoes are not made from whirling air but made from whirling warped space and time this simulation shows what happens as two black holes get closed they turn space into a turbulent sea of gravity waves these waves have the effect of carrying energy away from the orbit itself that allows the pair to draw each other in and merge into one we go back to half of the age of the universe and all these black holes are swirling large amounts of gas so it's a fun time in sort of the golden age for the growth of most black holes the reason why this because most of the large major mergers are occurring in the universe around this time  this simulation shows how a galaxy like our own might have taken shape in a flurry of mergers and collisions in the beginning gravity drew patches of stars and gas together a new larger patch grew still others  in fact the universe is littered with galaxies in the process of ripping each other apart and crashing together in the turmoil of each new merger another victim is thrust into the jaws of a growing black hole and in the densest regions of the universe a small percentage of these monsters have been able to grow to a level of size and ferocity we can scarcely imagine and yet amid all the violence are clues to how the universe and even places like Earth came to be what they are astronomers have long puzzled over a class of ultra bright beacons of light from the distant universe called quasars  in time they linked them to the outpouring of energy from the Centers of galaxies and to growing black holes but how can something that emits no light shines so brightly  to get it the chance to solve this mystery has drawn a crowd near NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida 82nd Rangers go mounted in the nose of a rocket just up the beach is the next-generation cosmic Explorer 10 9 8 & 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 go here a delta rocket carrying in flames gamma-ray telescope searching Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is part of a larger effort to explore the role black holes play in shaping the universe  well to me the idea that you're standing here on the planet in our own little area of our galaxy we're able to look around and make meaningful measurements have a theoretical understanding of the entire universe in which we live to me is something that all of humankind can justifiably take pride in the black holes that enter Steve Ritz a project scientist and his team are among the largest ones out there the energy they emit is thought to stem from periods of rapid growth at the centre of galactic feeding frenzies [Music] billions of years ago in places where the universe was dense with matter gravity drew swarms of young galaxies hurtling toward each other a large galaxy grew in the center and when another galaxy fell toward it it hurled matter at a central black hole force-fed like this the black hole could grow up to several billion times the size of our own Sun this crazy growth that black holes would go through particularly early on this would be a rare event not everywhere in a universe particularly when the universe is still young will have this huge gas inflows that will allow the black hole to grow so fast and when a supermassive black hole grows it vents its rage on the surrounding universe you can see the evidence in these telescope images they show powerful beams of energy or jets coming from the Centers of galaxies and often extending tens of thousands of light years into space  such outbursts can have a profound impact on their host galaxies and beyond  probing the Perseus galaxy cluster the Chandra x-ray Observatory found immense hot cavities hollowed out of the surrounding gas the culprit they believe is a jet of radiation coming from a large central galaxy  as it roared out this jet created shockwaves so powerful it pushed huge volumes of gas beyond the central region and without this gas new stars can't form that explains why some of the largest galaxies are filled with old stars most likely born before their black holes began erupting at the same time a black hole jet concede the surrounding regions with the heavy elements needed to form solar systems and planets like ours we see these Jets of particles being blown clear out of the galaxy and they were serious because we know when they're pointed roughly in our direction they're very strong emitters of very high-energy gamma rays  the Fermi telescope joins a growing fleet of observatories in space capable of reading the high-energy x-rays and gamma rays associated with these Jets it's rather like seeing a track of bullets and trying to follow the forensics down to what gun could have fired the bullet where was the gun what were the properties of the gunpowder and so on the gun in this case is a mysterious whirling region of space-time the black hole but what allows the gun to fire and produce a jet black hole also has the property that as it spins on its axis as the Earth spins it dragged space into a whirling motion like the air in a tornado faster near the horizon slower farther awaits if they are in the tornado is whirling faster near the car than it is farther away  in the eye of this cosmic tornado gas and stars flow into the hole along a rapidly spinning disk  the spinning motion generates magnetic fields that twist around as matter swirls in these fields channel some of the inflowing matter out into a pair of high-energy Jets so we can extract them the rotational energy of a black hole nature can extract us and the amount of energy we get out is enormous ly larger than all the energy you can get from burning all the nuclear fuel inside a star it's the equations of albert einstein that describe the source of this incredible power the extreme warping of space just outside the black hole what we can learn from these equations doesn't stop at the event horizon they can also let us enter with our minds the realm within a black hole  most likely will never directly see how those equations play out and live to tell a future Explorer prospecting for data we tempt fate by traveling too close if the monster is a collapsed star weighing a few times the mass of the Sun its gravity rises sharply the pull on the starships nose is so much greater than on its tail the gravity rips it to shreds  ironically you'd find a gentler ride into a supermassive black hole its larger size means it's gravity is more spread out [Music]  what you'd find if you made it inside is the most extreme destination in all the universe  [Music] Andrew Hamilton an astrophysics professor has been investigating what happens when matter falls inside a black hole  [Music] using Einstein's equations he and other scientists believe that falling into a black hole is equivalent to moving down a river and tumbling over a waterfall  like a cosmic precipice the outermost region of the black hole the event horizon is where space itself flows relentlessly in what does one mean by space falling or doing anything it's just that if you put objects in space then they will move in certain ways and if you put objects near a black hole as they approach the horizon inevitably they must approach the speed of light in order to stay at rest otherwise they're going to fall inside the horizon  if the black hole is spinning the central region is bounded by what's known as the inner horizon  in a case defined only by Einstein's equations an object may whip around so fast it gets flung outward if there's nothing inside the black hole except the space-time structure itself there's nothing inconsistent about having space fall inside turn back around and come back out again because space has no substance so there's no problem with it moving through itself it would be like a river racing over the falls hitting the rocks below then flowing back up  in a strange world of general relativity you fall in through a region a black hole region where space was falling faster than light and now space has turned around and is now pushing you outward faster than light imagine charting a starships course into this topsy-turvy realm  if you survive the fall down to the event horizon you'd accelerate through it  you go with the flow you hit the speed of light at the horizon now you can still see stuff from the outside world even when you're inside the horizon but people can't see you because space is falling faster than light to understand the chaotic region within Hamilton has enlisted Einstein's equations in a project to visualize the black hole's inner Anatomy you could only get this close on a spaceship propelled by pure mathematics  passing through the event horizon we approach the central zone as we whip around we are flung out of a kind of cosmic tunnel known as a wormhole at its end we pass through what's known as a white hole like characters in a science fiction story we exit into another time or place perhaps another universe this strange passage is the work of theory in reality it couldn't form amid all the turbulence the moment you introduce any real matter then the stuff that's trying to fall in tends to collide with the stuff that's coming back out again there's a turbulent chaotic Malstrom deep down inside the black hole  in a waterfall this collision zone is where water crashes on the rocks and ricochets into the downward flow  here turbulence rises all order disappears in a black hole the collision zone is the inner horizon where swirling matter envelops the central core [Music]  that's the end of the line for a starship it gets instantly vaporized  the chief characteristic of this region near the inner horizon is that streams of energy are passing through each other and they're passing through each other very rapidly that counter streaming of material begins to build up to the point where itself gravitates and that gravity accelerates those streams even faster through each other in the gentle world we know the energy released by gravity quickly dissipates whatever crashes down settles into a state of rest inside a black hole the energy does not dissipate instead it builds on itself rising to an extreme state known as the planck density to grasp what that is imagine taking all the matter we can see with our telescopes all the trillions upon trillions of stars that make up all the galaxies in the universe and crush it down to the size of a marble note don't stop there keep going push it all the way down to less than the size of an atom that is a Planck density and that's kind of density that it's produced inside a black hole it's the most extreme place in our universe outside the Big Bang  in this state temperatures rise to a trillion trillion times hotter than the center of our Sun  [Music] it would be hard to imagine what destructive impact the release of this energy would have fortunately extreme gravity holds it tight within the black hole's event horizon  despite the roiling turmoil within the supermassive black hole in our galaxy is thought to be relatively quiet has it settled into retirement or will the energy of whirling space close to its event horizon somehow be unleashed astronomers believe that turbulent times lie ahead  the Andromeda galaxy is located two and a half million light-years from our Milky Way scientists calculate that it's barreling toward us at over 200,000 miles per hour  it will take around five billion years to reach us by that time the Sun will have entered its twilight years swelling to an enormous size and scorching the earth but a much larger galactic catastrophe is about to unfold a simulation of the Andromeda Milky Way collision shows the likely chain of events at first the two paths in a close encounter their mutual gravity tears them both apart scientists say the odds are that our solar system will get flung out to the far edges of this Maelstrom  [Music] as the galaxy's finally settled together - hungry supermassive black holes in their centers spiral toward each other from all the turmoil a new larger black hole will then emerge who knows whether we will be around to witness its birth as astronomers project the continued evolution of our galaxy they ask will the matter and energy and pounded within its central black hole remain there forever or is the black hole like all other cosmic bodies somehow subject to the ravages of time  we live at a time in which most of the energy of the universe is produced by stars trillions of years from now all across the universe stars begin to use up their fuel and fade away the largest stars fall toward the Centers of galaxies whether swallowed by supermassive black holes  [Music] as the universe decays it gives way to a long era dominated by the remnants of dying stars and black holes the far future of the universe is one where the stars have burned out and formed neutron stars or white dwarfs and some black holes and eventually over long periods of time the black holes merge together to form bigger black holes in time much of the matter within galaxies will fall into these black holes and they will become the last bastions of our universe how long will they last the answer may come from a theory proposed by the cosmologists Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking applied quantum physics to black holes and predicted that they wouldn't be black but would glow with heat radiation in a very distinctive way and of course if there's heat coming off heat energy coming off this energy has to come from somewhere the energy Hawking said would come from tiny particles emerging from the vacuum of space just outside the event horizon  [Music]  some of those particles radiate away taking minut amounts of mass from the black hole like water evaporating from the ocean over time the radiation grows stronger and stronger as the black hole shrinks and finally explodes when the last black hole dies that's the end of the universe as we know it how can we know if the theory is right and they actually do decay if black holes were made in the Big Bang with a mass of about that amount vivir is these black holes ought to be going pop about now and radio astronomers have look to see if they can see a sort of electromagnetic pulse associated with that they haven't found any  there might be other ways to see a black hole decay from all across space black hole Jets are blasting particles out at very near the speed of light  these particles called cosmic rays slam into our Earth's atmosphere with enough energy to create miniature black holes these mini monsters would decay immediately in a shower of particles but they are very difficult to observe we're all of those door xi look good ok what if you could produce collisions this powerful in an Earthbound lab and under controlled conditions actually create a black hole if you could then watch a decay it would provide a unique window onto the future of black holes ok filling blue will start culminating in blue rings it's hoped that taking two very high energies small pieces of a very fast proton and collided into each other you can put enough energy into a small enough space that you can actually create the conditions by which a black hole would form these black holes are so very small therefore very hot and therefore they essentially radiate themselves away immediately 1.2 1.3 town the nine barbecue is still locked the effect looks good all right here we go at Brookhaven National Lab in New York State physicists are using advanced technology to blast gold atoms in opposite directions down giant tunnels almost two and a half miles long they accelerate these atoms to within a tiny fraction of the speed of light  when the atoms collide a fireball erupts  sophisticated sensors record a splatter of subatomic particles a hot soup of gluons and quarks what we believe we're creating is a temperatures approaching two trillion degrees centigrade that's a hundred thousand times hotter than the interior of the Sun it's hotter than a supernova explosion it's harder than the surface of a black hole it's harder than a neutron star like we believe nowhere in the universe is at that temperature was last that temperature in the universe one microsecond one millionth of a second after the Big Bang  it's as if they are running the universe in Reverse taking us back to an instant when it was extremely hot and dense  creating a black hole it seems will take even more energy than that in fact more than any earthbound Collider can pack  that is unless there's more to our universe and to gravity than we thought our injection efficiency looks good the orbit looks good orbit RMS is under 2 millimeters in each plane Einstein's theory of general relativity is the one that we find in all the textbooks and it's the one that we're all sort of pledged to defend that would be rash to say it's the last word on the subject of gravitation and there are certainly alternatives here is around and some of them are quite popular and some of these theories these are non-standard theories of gravitation predict that you could make a black hole by colliding together subatomic particles some scientists believe they may be able to create one at a new and more powerful system in Europe called the Large Hadron Collider [Music] the key lies in whether the world we know is part of a more complex cosmic reality beyond the three spatial dimensions plus time that we experience in our everyday lives  if so we would be like insects living on the two-dimensional surface of a pond unaware the deep and complex reality below it that we can be living on the surface of the pond happily minding your own business but not realizing that under underwater something say a fish underwater can be swimming swimming through the water causing disturbances that propagate up to where we are we could feel it happening we could essentially see our universe around us changing but we look around for the cause of it and we won't know what it is  the idea is that a number of extra dimensions actually intersect our world 1012 pi okay when particles collide at very high energies those extra dimensions enhance the gravitational force between the particles enough to create a micro black hole what good the scientists will know a black hole is there when they see the shower of particles predicted by Hawking's theory and for a moment that will open a window to a deeper cosmic reality  a very idea that we could tap into this underlying realm shows how rich black hole research has become  Einstein's theory showed how black holes can generate extreme energies caused the universe to wobble and bend and twist up into knots  the recognition that black holes are fundamental to the workings of our universe is a major discovery of science in our time and if it turns out that they do have a finite lifetime their death will signal the end of our universe by some estimates the time horizon of the largest black holes goes out to a googol years take a1 and add 100 zeroes to it  that's an unfathomable spread of time but it's far short of forever the clock may well be ticking on our universe the alarm will sound when the last black hole explodes  you [Music]", "9_kJAui5Y6M": "", "hesKQ_y1P7k": "thank you very much grab a seat how you guys doing who hates math raise your hand good good to know where you are who loves math raise your hand and who's sort of in the middle and could care less about math okay that's all right because we're gonna try to tip you the other way all right like Jim said my name is Scott Flensburg I'm in the Guinness Book of World Records as the fastest human calculator and so I'm gonna do a demonstration for you in a minute but the most time we're gonna spend today is on you it's not about me I have a gift and I want to share it with you but I believe the most important time we can share today is making sure that you can leave here doing something that you never thought you could do to truly in caps encapsulate that superhero feeling and so to get started it is James in the bag come on up James everybody give James hey he's gonna run the calculator for us we have a calculator okay so I have to get started I am NOT an athlete I'm a mathlete all right all of you athletes know that you have to stretch out your body first and warm up but as a mathlete I have to warm up my brain first so we're gonna do some basic stuff and then try harder stuff as we go but I'll need some volunteers to pick some numbers so we need some really heavy voices probably to be able to have everybody here so I don't have a volunteer anybody I need okay and start right in the front what's your name Anton so let's start off with addition all right let's do two-digit numbers to get started so you'll say like seventy-three I'll say plus you say another two-digit number I'll say plus back and forth we're gonna go I'm gonna try to add them up in my head he's gonna do it on the calculator I have screens all around me so it's very easy to cheat I do not want to cheat I don't need to cheat so I will close my eye so I'm gonna go away over here next to James so I can't see these screens I'll be over here there's nothing personal against that side of the room I just want to make sure I'm not cheating so Anton you ready we've got a zero on the board right where's our calculators we got a zero okay I'll close my eyes you're gonna say a number I'll say Plus back and forth we go you ready okay loud and clear ready go ahead plus plus plus plus plus plus one more 3:54 yeah all right good job Anton thank you very much thank you now I'm just curious how many of you can do that remember your reaction to me asking you that most you started laughing out loud some of you totally dismissed it but I promise you every one of you in this room can do what I just did adding up a bunch of two-digit numbers in my head with no pencil no paper I figured out how to do that when I was 9 years old so I'll share it with you and it's real easy all right but let's keep moving forward you need another volunteer somebody's strong voice please you want to try it you got to shout it out okay what's your name Kate Kate let's do a little more addition please let's try three-digit numbers all right so I'll move over here James ready to go so you say three-digit number Plus back and forth we go from ready when you are I don't have to shout awesome three five six just say it normal like a human 356 plus 120 sorry 123 56 plus 120 Plus 742 Plus 893 plus 567 one more 129 2797 oh I think you guys typed it in wrong just so you know all right let's just check oh we can look at the numbers will rewind the tape all right but I promise you I can usually do this very well all right now let's try one more I need one more volunteer please somebody else with a microphone okay yeah stay in the same table thank you all right let's try one more three-digit or I just want to make sure I'm still warming up go ahead 392 plus 6 81 plus 9 16 plus 243 see it's the calculator isn't it ah see the heck we don't have to do any more unredeemed all right so let's move on let's try something tougher we'll try a multiplication all right let's clear the calculator James thanks buddy you're making me look good don't worry about it all right when I strike multiplication all right let's try 2 2 numbers and I want to multiply them together while he does it on there 96 times 74 that's 296 seven 104 right seven 104 let's try another one Khan get faster as we go it's alright 83 I'll do that 83 three times 91 that's seven five five three right yeah all right and I'm not memorizing this I'm calculating I promise you all right let's try one more volunteer please somebody close to him if you don't mind just to keep it logistically easy oh hi how are you doing well thank you what's your name Tim rice okay let's try let's try something tougher what do we do there that's too easy right cuz you can even do that right let's try a division all right let's do three-digit divided by a one-digit you use weird numbers so we'll get some decimals and stuff all right so three digit by one digit 337 divided by 567 point four those are easy let's try another one come on make it tough okay 982 982 divided by seven 140 point two eight five seven one four two eight five seven one four two eight five seven right all right okay got it done we're good good job all right thank you all right so I guess I'm warmed up now and who has a calculator and right in front of them real handy oh if you just I only need one or two James is gonna do this but I could cheat because there's too many screens but if you have a calculator or an iPhone or you know you want to do this go ahead I usually do square roots but square roots are really easy people memorize square roots it's easy to figure those so we're gonna try cube roots a little bit tougher all right so on your calculator clear the calculator and James you do this to I won't look all right everybody punch in like a crazy two-digit number to get started and then hit the x key and then hit the same two-digit number again and hit the x key and hit the same two-digit number again and hit equals so you should get a big answer on your screen right so everybody that did that you got it and you don't have an e on your screen tell me the answer you came up with and what I'll do is extract the cube root out of that number you see what I mean all right so James would you come up with 47 yeah use 47 all right let's try another one come on who else yet loud and clear please 99 okay let's try a tougher one all the way in the back I missed the first one really really 23 I think yeah yeah it's one of my favorites let's try another one come on somebody else somebody else get one way in the bag go ahead 25 yeah let's try one more  82 yeah that's your I graduated high school almost go ahead 328 509 is 69 very good all right one more anybody else got tough one yeah one more 77 right yeah he tried my nemesis number that's good all right so so now I can do numbers in my head right you believe me I'm a human calculator I have this superpower since I was nine years old when I was 11 my buddy had a calculator his name's Andrew McKay I always give them credit because your friends ask you the best questions sometimes it opened up windows and opportunities in your life that you never would have found yourself with all these blind spots Andrew happen to ask me a great question at the right moment on a calculator that he had punch in 5 + 5 please James and you should get 10 right so now if James hits equals one more time what will the calculator say I heard three different answers I heard 10 15 and 20 which one do you think it is it's 15 go ahead James hit equals and keep hitting equals get a nice little rhythm and just show them how calculator counts by a number this is called a constant my buddy had a calculator he's like Scott we know you can do all these basic addition subtraction multiplication division can you do this our calculator is counting by a number I'm just kidding equal so he did 28 plus 28 equals and you started hitting equals and it wanted me to add 28 over and over again and it was like a sense awoke in my brain I'll never forget it was in front of mr. Murphy's class remember everything about it and I'm sitting there in his 2856 84 it just started making sense to me and so I want to demonstrate that for you first all right so somebody over here please pick a two-digit number you'd like me to count by good number 27 plus 27 equals and you'll see that my brain gets going faster and faster all right so tell me when you ready James you ready to rock and roll okay so 27 plus 27 is 54 81 one zero eight one three five one six two one eight nine two one six two four three two seven zero two nine seven three two four three five one three seven eight four oh five four three two four five nine four eight six five one three five four zero five six seven five nine four six two one six four six seven five seven oh two seven two nine seven five six seven eight three eight one zero eight three 76 forty nine one nine one eight nine four five nine seven two nine nine nine yada yada yada like that oh three more three more two one more yeah there you are James good job 99 all right so that's my gift that I discovered when I was very young and everybody's like you know what he do with that you didn't nobody know what to do with me my teacher thought I was an alien they don't you know no one's talked to me so it's just a gift nobody had to do with it well I got very blessed a friend of mine in Los Angeles his name's Eric Schatz he has a company called l m n o productions and i did a show for them a long time ago called how they do that and it's all about networking you know it amazes me because years later Eric got the rights to Guinness World Records TV show in America and he called me up as a friend and said Scott what can we do with you to get you into the Guinness Book World Records to get on the TV show and then we talked about it I said you know there's just one thing I can do this counting by a number there he goes yeah that's pretty crazy let's see if we can do that so here's the contest they set up they found the fastest accountant in the world that can run a ten key calculator to race me counting by a number so the judge chose the number 38 so I had to add 38 plus 38 plus 38 out loud as fast as I could racing this guy on a calculator doing 3/8 plus 3/8 plus 3/8 plus sir as fast as he could at the end of the 15 seconds he had 28 answers and I had 35 so actually beat the Machine by seven since then I've been invited to break that world record and London on TV there I did it with 36 and in Japan I got 237 answers in 15 seconds so I want to demonstrate for you what it sounds like when I'm going full-speed because that first example you can tell I was slow medium fast and then I go crazy that's what I'm just gonna go crazy all right so sir would you pick a two-digit number  72 I like that all right so 72 plus 72 this time gonna try to go full speed if anybody has a clock if you have 15 seconds anybody who's got a watch clock anybody who's gonna be a timer come on the iPhone has timers you guys know that all right we have one so when I say 72 you just start 15 second clock and when I finish just say stop or shut up or whatever you want all right you ready okay we're doing 72 right ready James you got it okay I'm ready to go 7 2 1 4 4 2 1 6 2 8 8 3 6 0 4 3 2 5 before five seven six six four seven two zero seven nine two eight four nine three six one zero zero eight one zero zero one one five two one two two four two nine six one three six eight one four four zero five one two and five a four one six five six one seven two eight one eight hundred one eight seven two one nine four four 2016-2018 one six zero two two three three two three or four two three seven six three four four eight two four four eight let's see well that's divided by 72 you should have thirty four something like that I don't know that should be 35 go ahead divided by 72 that'll be 35 answers so 34 so you can see how fast I have to everything has to be perfect to get to 37 so thank you very much and what I didn't get to do on that show that I'd love to do now is it was so funny we did this and I beat the calculator the judge comes over and he says Scott you're in the Guinness Book of World Records and I don't know I don't know why but if you go to a public school and you open up the library and you look in the library the Guinness Book World Records is and every school kids are fascinated by this book when I go to schools and kids introduce me by opening up the Guinness Book World Records and reading your world record all the other kids in the room it changes everything it's an amazing thing to be in the Guinness Book World Records it's really an honor that didn't realize how much energy would have in my mission but what was funny was good to the commercial break and the judge said Scott you beat the machine you're in the book he goes but we think you're cheating I was like how do you cheat counting by 72 he goes well we think maybe you've just memorized all these numbers here we are at Jim quicks memory class right I mean you could memorize this stuff Jim if Jim just took a month off you could memorize all the answers and count by 72 - pretty fast and I said but that's not what I do first off I think calculating is faster than men Murr is a ssin I can beat any memorization person on the planet Earth with calculation I believe our minds calculate faster than they retrieve memory memories second place okay but what I'm going to demonstrate for you is that I'm not memorizing this that I can count by any number all right so let's go to this table over here sir would you pick let's live on the edge calculator always starts at zero so they thought I memorized every number starting at zero I said what if I could just count by starting at any number then count by seventy-two they said all right that would prove to us you're not remember Jim you would agree that's tough to memorize every number for every number right full-time job all right so pick a three digit numbers our new zero for this example prime number almost 291 times three and 97 times nine but it's good number 873 hold it against you all right so I just kidding so 873 now I promise you have never done this pattern before I don't even know he's gonna say next but I've never practiced starting at age 73 so he had Plus now what two digit number you want me to count by starting at 873 so you're ready to go James you got eight ninety nine nine two five nine five one nine seven seven one zero zero three one zero two nine one zero five five one zero eight one one 107 one one three three one one five nine one one 85 one two one one one two three seven one two six three one two eight nine one three one five one three four one one three six seven one three ninety three one for my nine one four four five one four seven yada-yada-yada it just keeps going my brain is wired like a calculator alright so thank you uh so I am not memorizing I'm calculating so today I want to show you that each one of you have a calculator in your brain I'm very honored to be on a show right now called superheroes with Stan Lee an amazing thing I just got back from Scandinavia kids every kid has watched that show over there on the discovery or the History Channel it's an amazing vehicle it's really an honor to be considered a superhuman right I mean you know it's very rare and it to be on that show is one thing but one of the things I just want to show you real quick is this before you go James alright coz easier if you're here is that okay we'll do this one alright so I have a gift to be the human calendar as well I can calculate dates alright so you can give me any date in history and I can figure out what day of the week it was on alright so do we have any people remember like kids birthday a wedding something like that okay way in the back just start with month/day/year Wednesday about 3:30 just kidding all the time but 66 wins there right way to stay there you go alright come on it's tougher dates yep October 2nd 47 right Thursday you're born on a Thursday let's see if he can get there should be dude see House computers are so slow right there there you go was that wood October 2nd I think he said 46 didn't he what did you say 47 I said it right anyway I got a lot of lucky guess yeah go ahead Anton go ahead Oh a future day will be a Thursday it's almost Friday the 13th but not quite I think I don't know I'm just guessing at this point I just hoped James makes me looking at Kim on James Thursday all right good job buddy all right so I can calculate any day of the week and figure out what day of the week it was on it seems like a different type of trick like what purpose would that serve but it played a big role in my life and so I want to share that with you next but first can we give James a big hand for helping out buddy thank you about it great job there a good senior person all right I'll see out all right so now we're gonna think like a calculator to show you all these things that I've done and that I said I could teach you how to do there's a couple things I want to show you and we're gonna start with this app on the iPad it's called white board Pro let me make sure that it's uh see it works it's just a little tricky all right so here we go everybody take a look at this I'm gonna write something down that you all did when you're about nine years old our teacher made us write these 10 numbers across the page and I'll never forget this day it was in 4th grade I was 9 years old and our teacher wrote down 0 through 9 and I was uh I was not a good student I was more of a troublemaker and bored and you know just trying to fill the time and for some reason I stopped my teacher and I said hey wait a minute who picked those shapes why does the Ford look like that why does the 7 look what does the 3 look like the 2 who picked those shapes why did they pick those shapes and my teacher looked at me like wow you know I've never even thought about that I don't know the answer that she has some math friends they didn't know the answer to it we started asking more people nobody could tell me the answer I was like how it was it we're using these and nobody can even tell me where they came from or why they look like they do so it's taken me about 30 years I've searched the world and what I want to do is first introduce to you what I call chapter zero I believe it's the missing chapter in math that if we would all learn what you're about to learn now first it would give every kid on our planet a chance to really understand math but we what we start off wrong here's first office look at how many numbers are up there how many numbers did I write down 10 is there a 10 on there anywhere no so when you turn on a calculator look at this calculator how many buttons have numbers on that machine there's 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 there's no 10 on a calculator but here's what we do to kids and you guys have all done this your whole life as we confuse people because here's what we do the human body has 10 fingers we've all learned to do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 that's indoctrinated in our brain it is everywhere and this is what's confusing us because when you turn on a calculator it always starts at 0 the only reason the calculator works is because it starts at 0 so if you want to turn on your calculator you have to start at 0 so watch this 10 fingers 10 digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it's really 0 through 9 no magic it's just thinking like a calculator so everybody please take your hands put them up in the air shake out that 1 through 10 bunch of crazy Romans did that to us close your fist and now start with 0 the first finger you ready 0  so now you're all thinking like a calculator zero through nine so I can share with you the different things that happened to me that allowed me to have this sense of numbers I guess but look at the shapes up here I asked my teacher where'd the shades come from they didn't know I found the answer I think the inventors of this language we're fighting the Roman numerals the Roman numerals were the biggest number system in the world the Roman Empire was managing the world basically and so Roman numerals were what we're trusted your finances were done in Roman numerals everything in society was done in Roman numerals they were trusted this was like magic this was this new invention this new language of numbers so nobody trusted them so they were doing everything they could to make this as easy as possible to teach they came up with a brilliant idea the shapes were meant to be able to communicate to you the value of each shape by how many angles are in the shape so it looked a little bit differently the zero is a circle how many angles in a circle zero so when you look at that shape you know there's a value of zero the number one started out a little bit differently it started like that and this shape gives you one angle right there so everybody knew that shape had a value of 1 the number 2 started out like our letter Z and this shape gives you one two angles so everybody knew that shape had a value of two the number three started out like a hieroglyph looked like that this shape gives you one two three angles 3 corners so everybody knew that I had a value of 3 the number 4 looked a little differently it started out like this and this shape gives you 1 2 oh let me go back here to - 1 2 3 4 angles see how that works pretty easy right I mean it makes sense when you started thinking about it 5 was tough they had to put a tail on it this gives you 1 2 3 4 5 angles 5 corners 6 was really easy they just put a box on it looked like that this shape will give you 1 2 three four five six corners six angles and when I'm doing shows in schools it's always funny because the kids don't care about anything till they get to seven so like how you gonna get seven angles out of that but somebody really brilliant came up with this they added two lines this gives you one two three four five six seven isn't that so simple right but who took me we're gonna take me like centuries to figure that out and now eight eight was easiest one it's just an hourglass one two three four five six seven eight all right and nine was the tough one they called this one the ugly duckling looked pretty bad but it got the job done that's nine angles right there one two three four five six seven eight nine so why don't we learn that in like third grade everybody should know that I just seemed so cool when I showed us the students they feel connected to numbers they feel like they know something they didn't know before it makes them feel like numbers they could understand a better might be their friend so this is what was happened to me in fourth grade everybody got that cool easy right okay so now let's go back to the numbers again zero through nine and now same day our teacher now wants us to write down these ten numbers again and this time we have to spell them so in your head spell each number zero zer o1 o ne and so on what number up there when you spell it has the same number of letters as its number value for four is spelled F oh you are maybe it's because I was in fourth grade I was fascinated on the number four and fourth grade maybe but I was writing down these answers and I noticed that four had four letters and I was just so excited I ran up to my teacher I was like this is incredible four has four letters and she's like what's wrong with you Scott who cares the four has four letters I said it's really cool because no other number does that zero doesn't have zero letters one doesn't have one letter seven doesn't have seven letters the only number in English that has the same number of letters as its number value is the number four I was so intrigued by that and that's what made me notice the next thing is take a look at the numbers up here which numbers up here when you spell them use 4 letters say it when you see them I heard five what else zero that's the one people usually miss there's another one I heard it nine so we have zero four five and nine are all four-letter words and maybe you noticed how many numbers have four letters four so I'm freaking out again I wrote it to my teacher I go check this out four numbers have four letters she's like who cares what's the big deal I said this is this is the way I mean it makes sense because look it splits your numbers when you're doing it this way watch where the four-letter words end up 0 through 4 5 through 9 the four letter words are bookends on your fingers to help you remember to count from 0 to 4 5 to 9 10 has nothing to do with numbers alright everybody cool and then one other number it's no big deal but I have to bring it up because it was a really funny moment my teacher I was working on the number 7 and I was looking at the word spelled se ve N and I caught it right away I don't know why maybe you guys still haven't noticed and he eventually did but if you cross off the S you end up with the word even but 7 is an odd number so I just walked up to my teacher I said who put the word even in an odd number why did you do that she's like oh I never noticed that before no big deal I was like are you kidding me this is a huge problem we have to fix this immediately and she I didn't even sleep that night I was so distraught over this but it hit me the next day we had to change 7 to sod try it one time you're not liking it that's ok it's alright it's probably not gonna catch on but and it would mess up my whole four letter word things so it's okay but this is how I started thinking about numbers and it was really challenging for my teachers because I was asking all these crazy questions they didn't know I was coming from next but the next day is the day that changed my life fourth grade mrs. loves class Herkimer New York I am in the back of the room where I always sat next to my best friend him and I were on the same baseball team and we would talk about math the whole time and for some reason our teacher was showing us how to do this we had to learn how to add numbers where you carry all right so 7 plus 2 is 9 10 14 carrot so can anybody tell me the answer to that I think I already heard it I did 54 who got that so quick Wow that was very cool I'll quiz you later all right so let's let's try this how'd everybody do it when I asked you to add this up did you go 7 plus 2 is 9 plus 1 is 10 plus 4 is 14 write down the 4 carry the 1 1 2 3 4 plus the 1 is 5 is that how you do it worst way to add absolutely the worst way to add those four numbers together and yet we teach every kid on the planet to do that I got really lucky that day because I was not paying attention to my teacher I did not I didn't hear that we had to add these numbers up from the right and then carry and all that stuff I did not hear a word and she saw me not paying attention she said Scott why don't you come on up and do this problem for us I was totally busted I'm walking up to the front of the room thinking I already hate math I'm gonna hate math even more now when I get done with this I get up to the board and for some reason my brain went backwards I started over here at the tens I said that's a 10 that's a 10 that's a 10 that's a 10 so I started keeping a running total in my head 10 plus 10 is 20 plus 10 is 30 plus 10 is 40 and then I just kept going 40 plus 7 is 47 plus 2 49 plus 150 plus 4 54 and I just wrote down the answer my teacher was amazed that I got it right because she thought I was not listening and she said Scott how did you get this answer where's your carrier you're supposed to put a 1 up here I said I don't even know what you're talking about what's a what's a carry she goes you have to start over here and go this way carry and I said all I started over here I went this way she was know you have to go this way I said but I'm faster than you going this way she's alright you do this so everybody try this one on your own see how you do just raise your hand when you get the answer please don't say it out loud so everybody can experience it  just raise your hand already come on keep them up I want to see you again Center who's not getting it really what's the answer say it 88 you know it's funny when I started the show I added up a whole bunch of two-digit numbers I raced the calculator I beat the calculator got it right the first one and I stopped the show and I asked all of you how many of you can do that if you remember your reaction you all started laughing out loud like that even asked you know less want to show you how to do it how many of you got that right almost everybody in the room first try if you'll practice this for five minutes ask your friends or family to write down some two-digit numbers practice adding them up you'll be able to do this faster in your head than anybody on a calculator 20 40 60 70 79 88 boom start grouping you're gonna be like that little kids do this little third fourth fifth graders beating their teachers punching the numbers into the calculator so when I asked you if you could do that and you all started laughing you didn't think you could do it and now you know how easy it is and you can do it here's my next question to you what else can you do that you didn't think you could do what are the limits do we put on ourselves what limits are we putting on our kids with our education system and our mentality and society how we think like this limits our brain activity limits our potential it doesn't allow us to reach our potential so this was an accident that happened to me in fourth grade that changed my life because from that point forward I would always look for an easier way to get the answer when we started learning division multiplication all these things I would look for easier ways to get the answer just give you one more example because I want to move on to something else is multiplication what 7 times 7 9 times 9 12 times 12 no math you have all memorized those questions not one person in this room calculated anything you all memorize this stuff we teach our kids to memorize their math 7 plus 7 9 times 9 these are all memorized they're not learning if they're memorizing it so they get the passing grade teacher gets paid the parents are happy and then they wake up in algebra and go what happened what's going on you know no understanding of basic arithmetic so I just want to show you one more thing that had me what's 7 times 11 4 times 1111 is a magic number I was 11 years old when I noticed this so it really got my attention here's how we do arithmetic 24 times 11 not just in America but around the world we teach kids to go like this 4 times 1 is 4 2 times 1 is 2 don't forget the zero where it's all wrong 4 times 1 is 4 2 times 1 is 2 you add these all together is that how you guys multiply worse way to multiply all right so let me show you the fastest way there's six ways to multiply numbers together but we only teach one the worst one by the way it literally is a trick but I can't get into all those today but I just want to show you this one about the number 11 because that was 11 when I noticed this but watch how easy 11 is any number times 11 3 steps to getting the answer first step just take this back number and drop it down here on the back take the front number drop it into the front and then just add them together what's 2 plus 4 6 and put it in the middle same answer no hardly any work right it's so easy it's an easy mental exercise so let's try it I'm gonna erase that let's all try one let's do 32 times 11 what's the answer 3 2 what's in the middle 5 so what is 43 times 11 473 you're not doing a lot of arithmetic but you're not memorizing anything either this gives your kids a chance to break out of that 10 by 10 memory box that we make kids go through all right okay so I'm not I talked to Jim about this before the show and I want to do more math but I only have so much time and I really want to get into something that's very time sensitive I didn't know what to do with my gift I was in school my parents didn't know what to do with me my teachers didn't know what to do me I was in upstate New York we didn't have a gifted program and I was not very attentive to if I was more into sports so I was more of a distraction for my teachers and I ended up not graduating high school I failed English my senior year by one point and they would not give my high school diploma in New York you have to have an English credit your senior year I had scholarships for math baseball different things forfeited everything Regents scholarships it was a very painful day in my life my teacher failed me by one point on an essay so that I couldn't graduate and it was a brutal brutal day had to turn in my gown miss my graduation event canceled my party it was a you know it's it was a brutal day brutal week and I decided to run and so I joined the United States Air Force and I left upstate New York and I got as far away as I could I went in the Air Force they heard about my skills and they took me to Japan as a special duty assignment I got to do some crazy stuff learn Japanese do all kinds of really crazy projects things like that it was a lot of fun but about four or five years into my Air Force time my sons my supervisors son failed second grade math and he said hey can you sit down with Travis and just talk to him show him show him some things we know you're good with numbers I set that one for 30 minutes the next day his school called and said I don't know what you told this kid but you got to come in and talk to the rest of the class I had never spoken publicly I walked into a group of 2nd and 3rd graders or maybe 25 of them I had the most amazing 40 minutes of my life those kids were so excited about what I could do but more importantly they were so excited about what I was showing them I was like holy cow I have this god-given ability but to find a way to use it to inspire others just dream come true I ran back to my base I said I got to get some time off please give me the afternoons off so I can start visiting more schools and my supervisor my big supervisor said no absolutely not so I snuck in some schools when I could on my own private time and I just kept getting more and more requests and so I finally decided to get kicked out of the Air Force on purpose which is a very awkward thing to do and to do it without going to jail is really tricky so it took me a little bit I got out and the thing is they gave me a big reenlistment bonus when I reached and so they wanted all that back so I woke up on 8 888 with nothing the Air Force had taken my car and then what others you know like the stereo whatever just stuff that you know I'd blown my reenlistment bonus on and I had nothing except my old car from high school 65 Buick Skylark convertible I pawned it for $1,200 bought a $700 plane ticket to LA to get on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson I'd spoken with him on the phone and I went out there had a great meeting and they said great we love you you're gonna be on the show give us your phone numbers like I don't have a number they're like well just give us how do we get ahold I was like I don't know you know I have 200 hours in my pocket I've never been to Los Angeles I need to be on the show like tonight and basically you know that's not how it works I ended up homeless in Los Angeles for a month 28 days never forget it just do what you can and I met this guy who had a company called Cameroon name of it sorry but it was just a small business and it was right on wolves for Bulevar and he said Scott I'll let you run this part of the office during the day and at night you can use my office as an apartment I have a shower bathroom you can just use it as an apartment during the day you work and at night you can stay here and I was like wow this is great so I got a gig in a place to stay all the same time well the only bummer was 28 days later got kicked out and his company got shut down so I lost my job in my house the same day you know so good and bad so I ended up with nothing there and he goes hey I got a friend in Florida who wants you to fly down there and help him with his project he's got a little money he wants to get started so I flew down to West Palm Beach Florida and this guy had invented a glow-in-the-dark doorknob for hotel rooms for security for emergency accidents I was like wow that's either brilliant or ridiculous but they're gonna pay me so I'm gonna go try to sell it so 30 days we met every major hotel chain in Florida and we sold zero glow-in-the-dark doorknobs so I was out of money I was out of time this guy didn't have anything left I had nothing I called my family my little sister Cindy was living in Phoenix Arizona and she she said Scott just get to the airport I got a plane ticket waiting for you and you know come to Phoenix you can stay at my boyfriend's house for a while get situated so I was right after 8888 I'm waiting in West Palm Beach I have nothing to do that and I'd have nowhere to stay I have 20 hours before my flight and I walk into the West Palm Beach public library and I found I'm going through the math which most homeless people do you know when they're hanging out of the library's mouths exit and I walked through and I see this little book it's like this bag and this thin it's ancient it's over a hundred years old and nobody checked it out in like 50 years and the guy had said that there's a calendar a way to calculate the day of the week of the calendar I was like all right you know it's all numbers I got I can handle the numbers so let's see what the formula is so I wrote down after a few hours of looking at it reading through how he was doing it I took on a three and a half by five index card with a little pencil that you get at the library and I wrote down this little algorithm put it in my pocket got on the plane the next day and got this algorithm in my head so that I could figure out what day of the week it was on I landed in Phoenix my little sister Cindy picks me up at the airport I said Cindy what's your birthday July 23rd 60 I was like oh you were born on a Tuesday she goes who cares I was like great that's gonna be a good skill as it's worked out now serving as the global ambassador of world math state which I'll tell you about at the end every school I visit hundreds of kids the best part is not my show the best part is afterwards the kids all get a card for me and they put their name in their birthdate down and I get to have a moment with them I get to say their name I get to look at their birthday I get to tell them it was a Tuesday or a Friday autograph it just have a few seconds with each kid and that is the coolest part of what I do I get to see the kids reactions to what I taught them during the show I get to do something not just some random math trick I'm giving their birthday these kids are running home and saying mom was I born on a Friday this guy figured it out in half a second it connects me with them on a whole different level it's really turned into something special for me but we have a very special day coming up very soon 12-21-12 for those of you don't know that's the end of the Mayan calendar you've you've all heard about this right ok so I don't have to get into that the Mayan calendar comes to an end of a cycle on December 21st 2012 after I discovered that I could calculate the day of the week all these other questions started coming to my head why do we use a calendar that's so difficult to figure out what day of the week a date is on hee the algorithm you have to do to figure out what day of the week a date is on you have to take the year plus the year divided by four plus the date plus the month divided by seven that's what I have to do to calculate what day of the week that date is on I have to put all those numbers in all those variables for those you that are writing it down just so you have it if you want it here are the variables for the months each month has a number valued it's not 1 through 12 it goes like this January's is 0 February is three marches 3 April 6 May 1 June is 4 July is 6 August to September 5 October 0 November 3 December 5 those are the values you got to know so there's all kinds of numbers floating around but I won't get into the algorithm of this as much as I will the questions that made me ask why are we using this crazy calendar do you know the calendar we use is called the what calendar Gregorian calendar anybody know why it's called Gregorian Pope Gregory the 13th and 1569 realized that the calendar we were using from the time of Julius Caesar was miscalculating leap years they were miscalculating leap years this whole time so the only reason I don't say the only reason the big reason the Roman calendar the Gregorian calendar exists is to calculate Easter Easter is the big day it has to be after a full moon after the spring equinox there's all these little variables that have to be added up to keep this thing this very special day to them on the right day because they miscalculated they were off by 10 days so from 1569 to 1582 Pope Gregory and his team tried to figure out what to do and here was what they did everybody went to bed October 5th 1582 and they woke up on October 15 15 8 they decided to just skip 10 days people missed birthdays weddings pay rent I mean if people were crazy Russia was so mad that an adopter for like 300 years it was they were so upset it really offended everybody but the Pope did it papal decree he couldn't do that today just say hey let's just skip 10 days the Roman calendar makes no sense we start the year on January 1st can anybody tell me why why do we start the year on January 1st  you", "t7sRWrvRdrA": "even though we've been living on this planet for thousands of years we're still a long way from discovering everything about it sometimes we find something that's been hidden or buried for hundreds or even thousands of years and changes the way we think about our own history here are some truly incredible recent discoveries that have shed fresh light on the past those who go digging for buried treasure are used to finding most things in the ground but Swiss archaeologists were more than a little surprised when they discovered this bronze hand they asked other experts around the world what it might mean or represent but none of them knew either it's been carbon dated back to 2,000 BC but nothing like it from that time period has ever been found it's too delicately constructed to have been a prosthetic and nothing about the skeleton or the gold pieces and jewelry found buried with it offer any further clue at all the best guess of archaeologists is that it's a symbolic replacement for a hand the buried man may have lost during life in the summer of 2017 archaeologists working in a cave in Barrow Island Australia made a discovery that changes everything we know about human habitation in the country initially it was believed that Australia's indigenous population the Aborigines settled on the land some 47,000 years ago however remnants of charcoal primitive hunting equipment and animal remains within the cave pushes that finding back by at least 18,000 years it was long believed that the arrival of humans on Australia's land was responsible for driving off much of the natural fauna that called it home now there's evidence that animal and man lived side by side for thousands of years it's not always scientists who make incredible discoveries though anybody who spends their time digging in the ground has a chance that's what happened to miner Sean funk in Alabama in March 2011 funk was a veteran miner and it seemed plenty of fossils and curiosities in his time but nothing quite like what made shut his machinery down that day feeling his bucket hit something harder than the surrounding rock funk took a closer look and saw what he thought were brown rocks with a pattern of what felt like stone disks on the back of each one these weren't rocks they were dinosaur bones and funk had discovered a new kind of dinosaur the newly christened dinosaur was a huge armored plant eating reptile which had likely been laying in the earth for 110 million years waiting to be discovered usually when fossils are found like this they've been flattened but the conditions within the mine kept this notice or in almost pristine condition when we think of stone circles we usually think of the ancient site of Stonehenge in England the giant rocks there have laid in formation for thousands of years and nobody knows how or why they were first put there were they a calendar a temple a clock people enjoy speculating about it as much now as they did hundreds of years ago and we still don't know the answer now Kazakhstan are facing the same questions as they've discovered an ancient stone circle of their very own near the town of octo an amateur archaeologist with a metal detector found a silver saddle in 2010 he alerted the professionals and a full dig was ordered revealing ancient stone carved with mysterious symbols and pictures nobody can be sure of the purpose of the site but it's believed it was built by the Huns fleeing the collapse of the Roman Empire some 1500 years ago [Music] the see usually gives up in secrets eventually it just takes a while in the case of this old Greek merchant ship it's been waiting around 2400 years this shipwreck recently uncovered over a mile below the Black Sea surface is officially the oldest intact shipwrecks ever discovered it was found by the Black Sea maritime archaeology project who have been surveying the land below the water with specialist equipment for some time the wreck is so well preserved that it's taught experts plenty about how ancient ships were constructed revealing twin rudders rowing benches and a more sophisticated mass design than they were expecting our ancestors may have been more advanced than we thought forget everything you think you know about Brett it's generally thought that humans invented both bread and beer at around the dawn of the agricultural age 10,000 years ago we now know it's been going on much longer two stone fireplaces were recently discovered at a site within the black desert of Jordan believed to have been a campsite for hunter-gatherers researchers study the contents of the fireplace and found traces of a rudimentary unleavened bread based on wild cereal and tubers the site dates back at least 14,000 years on top of that research on some stone monuments belonging to another Natufian tribe and found 150 miles west of the original site indicated traces of wheat and barley the Natufian were eating bread and drinking beer thousands of years before anybody else the first rule of ninja Club is that you don't talk about ninja Club that's the basic message of a 300 year old oath that was recently uncovered among a stash of documents given to a Japanese University in the late 16th century the documents had been stored but never cataloged or studied before the oath is signed by a ninja named in Asuka kazoo thanking his ninjutsu master for his training and promising never to divulge the secrets of the martial art fear of retribution by sixty gods for generations given that we've only found the document now he kept his promise the rest of the documents constitute what amounts to a guide on how to become a ninja at the ancient way they are all now available online if you want to try training yourself you never really know what you might find with a metal detector on a lucky day you might change history completely detectorists Mike Smith was out in Wales one day in 2018 when he came across a Celtic burial chariot hidden within the earth the excited amateur informed experts about what he'd found immediately but was told that he must be wrong because Celtic burials had never taken place in that area nevertheless the professionals came to take a look and were astonished when they uncovered a full sized Iron Age settlements buried underground full of Celtic artifacts previously it was believed that the Celts occupied Ireland Scotland and some of northern England but never came as far south as Wales we can now say for sure that they spread farther than we thought 2018 was a great year for discoveries we also found the ancient lost Trojan city of tinea which was built from the ground up by prisoners it's a relic of the enormous historical Trojan conflict which started when Helen wife of the king of Sparta got into a disagreement with Paris of Troy the site is located within what is now Turkey tanea was built by those who became prisoners of the conflict but looks to have become an affluent trading town over time that's based on the significant amount of Roman coins that have been found there as well as fine pottery and gaming dyes which are indicators of a lively market town the city is believed to have been active from the fourth century BC until towards the end of the Roman Empire but was slowly abandoned as the Romans moved on to Greece after Troy fell Stonehenge now has competition as the most mysterious ancient monument in Britain 20 miles away from the famous site is another larger circle it was first noticed around 30 years ago and was thought to date back to the same era as Stonehenge but recent improvements to carbon dating processes have been able to prove that it's actually 800 years older dating back to around 3300 BC the remains of the circles are still visible along with much of the thick wood which would be set on fire to create a vast burning circle experts believe it may have had a ritual use although nobody can say for sure the jakku archeological site in China has already provided us with a lot of evidence about early human civilization but in 2017 it excelled itself the Neolithic site gave up weaving tools bone needles and silk proteins in short it provided evidence that silk weaving took place at the site some eight thousand five hundred years ago a time when it was thought humans still largely wore clothes made from flax fibers silk weaving was thought to have begun 5,000 years ago at most but that was clearly wrong legend has always said that silk trading began at Jehu the site is on the legendary Silk Road trading route that defined the world's commerce thousands of years ago Jehu is also where the world's oldest playable musical instrument was discovered it's a window into a time long since gone the Inuit have been hunting bears since the dawn of civilization they passed the traditions and stories of bear hunting down to each other in the form of story and legend from one generation to the next one of those stories concerned the king bear a gigantic beast comparable to Bigfoot in western legends it was thought to be a charming tale but nothing more until now a one thousand three hundred year old bear skull has emerged from the ice of Alaska and it's larger than any bear skull ever found before it's also bigger than any species of living bear this might be consistent with the Inuit King bear said to be twelve feet long narrow bodied moving with great pace and speed vast parts of the Arctic have never been explored could they still be out there sometimes you spend year searching for a lost Roman city and then find it by accident we knew that Ossetia existed because it's referred to by name in many ancient Roman texts but nobody could find any physical evidence of where it once stood then an archaeological survey needed to be carried out in southern France before a school could be built on a proposed site and the lost city was found by chance researchers descended on the site and mass and found that you Setia was occupied from 100 BC to around 700 AD although it seems to have stood empty from the Year 200 to the Year 300 with no obvious reason why a series of astonishing mosaics depicting animals are the highlight of the discovery so far these were common Roman decorations but didn't become common until around 200 years after the time of Ossetia it would seem that it was a city ahead of its time zero is a number we take for granted nowadays it just means the absence of something but the discovery of the concept zero is one of the greatest mathematical breakthroughs in human history it created a symbol for nothing and changed the way we calculate as it turns out that happened earlier than we thought it did fresh radiocarbon dating of the Indian Bosch Kali manuscript which has been in the UK since 1902 and is full of zeros has dated to around the Year 300 about 500 years earlier than previously believed although other cultures have their own symbols to indicate nothingness the appearance of zero as a dot on the manuscript is the beginning of the zero symbol we all recognized today subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications and you will be the first to know when a new video comes out thank you for watching and see you soon [Music]", "voztwgixwtg": "", "SENlu34OazM": "hi this is Brian Forrester and everything that you'll see in this video is in my new book lost ancient technology of Egypt volume 2 at amazon.com  now everything you're going to see in this video could not have been done by the dynastic Egyptians such as the lid of this granite box you can see those striations which are clearly saw marks and there's no way that that was a copper saw or bronze saw with silica sand being used because silica sand is about the same hardness as the granite itself so it had to have been a saw of a harder material likely diamond or possibly something even more exotic than that this is located in a dark corner of the Museum in Cairo likely because the authorities don't want you to see it but there it is and then we also have other large stone boxes that some people call sarcophagi but this one's intriguing in that it was damaged during its construction you notice the two circular saw marks there and so obviously this was a series of two powered saws parallel to one another that were running and then accidentally the saw blade on top began to cut deeper into the box and cause the lid to simply snap off and so whoever was making the box simply abandoned the project you can also notice that the front of the saw blade is thinner than the sides which is quite curious and I'm sure all of you have seen at least photographs of this which is called the schist disc located in the Cairo Museum it's about two to two-and-a-half feet in diameter and unfortunately it was badly repaired by the authorities it was found at saqqara along with 30,000 to 40,000 turned hard stone bowls now you see the three lobes on it they are not angled so it's not as if it was pushing or pulling water it clearly rotated around the central axis but what its original function was is unknown it is not what the authorities call a Lotus Bowl obviously it's a piece of some kind of machine and these are some of the turn bowls very very hard stone again there are not 30 or 40 of them but between 30,000 and 40,000 of them were found at saqqara by the archaeologist Emery and again that's also where these schist discs was found in a cache under one of the pyramids and what this thing was I have no idea but I can tell you that the stone is quartzite which is seven out of ten in terms of hardness so it could not have been made by the dynastic Egyptians and it shows curious burn marks on it and now this is the top of a very large granite box and here you can clearly see tube drill holes again this could not have been achieved by copper or bronze drill bits with sand being used as an as an abrasive and now we're at Abydos and this is the enigmatic Osirian located underground it was rediscovered in the 19th century large quartzite blocks in the background and then the square pillars that you see here in the foreground are granite which likely came from Aswan which is several hundred miles away and the blocks weigh up to 60 tons apiece and it looks like catastrophic damage happened here as well so we'll see lots of examples of ancient catastrophic damage not done by invading armies but by natural events and the somewhat fame light bulbs of dendara were they actual light light bulbs they look very much like what are called Crookes tubes but nobody honestly knows what they originally were an example of electricity maybe but unknown and now we're at Luxor and compared the size of the people walking with those giant seated figures originally those figures each were made out of one solid piece of stone either syenite or granite and they could not have been made by the dynastic Egyptians and this huge obelisk which is also located at Luxor one solid piece of granite it could very well be that the hieroglyphs were added later during dynastic times and now we're at saqqara and sakara is a huge ancient site that is the pyramid of pyramid of djoser in the background likely one of the earliest of the pyramids based on the dynastic Egyptians studying the Great Pyramid which preceded the dynastic Egyptians and look at the size of this shaft of which there are many located at saqqara deep in the bedrock and this is quite curious and could be cataclysm heat evidence notice the color of the limestone tends to be kind of whitish but the upper layers are yellow and even brown and black as if heat had been applied in the distant past and now let's go underground this I believe is called the Pyramid of T was recently open to the public and as we're going down you see the rubble on the left which probably is dynastic work and then these beautiful almost perfectly flat blocks of limestone and as we descend further down this was in March of 2018 as we walk back through these giant slabs our granite once again likely from Aswan and the exterior of the pyramid again which I have in another video shows cataclysmic heat damage as if the casing stone was literally burnt and blown off the surface and now also at saqqara we looked down this is a dynastic period shaft of some kind where the staircases go I don't know but they probably lead to an underground system of ancient tunnels look at the rather poor craftsmanship of the dynastic pyramid and then as we walk along we're going to see another shaft and this shaft again goes down into the bedrock itself so it's highly likely that this was achieved achieved using high technology there's the dynastic period work and now we're going into the shaft itself farther down you can see that's bedrock  and also at saqqara we have the fascinating place again look at the upper surfaces of the bedrock it appears to have been burnt by heat in ancient times and now we're going through the tunnel system and this tunnel system again was carved into the bedrock there are two parallel tunnels this is the main one which has several niches inside of which are giant stone boxes each one of these boxes averages a hundred tons the box itself is 70 tons the lid being 30 tons again the stone came most likely from Aswan several hundred miles to the south as we walk along further through we'll see very crude hieroglyphics unfinished on the box and academics still insists that the box and the hieroglyphics are contemporary with one another but the hieroglyphics are very poor unfinished and the box is astonishing and beautifully polished again the crabby nature of the hieroglyphics we can see and the very smooth polished nature of one of these massive boxes once again averaging a hundred tons and coming from as one most likely hundreds of miles away and as we walk through the other tunnel parallel to the first one this is an unfinished box and this tells us a lot because this shows us that quite possibly the roughing out of the box was done outside on the surface and then in this unfinished State was brought into the tunnel and then taken to its niche where quite likely the finishing work would have been done the problem is there was no light in the distant past in these tunnels there's no sunlight that penetrates and there's no SIP marks on the ceiling to tell us that this was dynastic period work and there is the lid of the box which would have preceded the movement of the box itself we're now at Tanis which is located in the Nile Delta of northern Egypt and again this is quartzite and notice the powerful heat effect on the right hand side as well the stone seems to have been blown off in some cases everything found at Tanis in general was found underground this is likely a dynastic period reconstruction of massive blocks that were found at Tanis and look at the size of that huge slab on the left again the stone probably gained came from the Aswin quarry which is about 700 miles away and there again quartzite with what looks like scorching now this is what's left of a quartzite statue and you can see as we get up close that the surface were melted by some intense heat Tannis is one of the most bizarre locations on the planet and here we see remnants destroyed of up to 15 massive obelisks and it's every piece of stone at Tanis is broken not through human intervention but likely from a giant Cataclysm in the very distant past the site was probably found by the dynastic Egyptians and here again quartzite with heat scorching well now we've returned to the Giza Plateau area this phynx is right behind this guy there you can see its head and today or now we're exploring the Osiris shaft that has only been open to the public for about two years you can only enter this with special permission and our group I believe paid somewhere in the region of two to three thousand dollars for two hours inside but it was absolutely incredible as you can see on his face so we're walking in and were walking straight into the bedrock itself and now we're gonna look down to the first level underground and the ladder takes you down approximately thirty feet into a chamber carved out of the bedrock  and now we've gone down the second level which is another hundred feet down into the bedrock luckily they've replaced the ladders because the one on the right is a little bit suspect but the newer ladders are actually quite sturdy and it's well worth it if you go to Egypt we'll be going back in April 2019 and that tour sold out in July of 2018 now in the second level there are six niches and there are two boxes this has a strange black goo on the surface that I'm going to take samples of in April 2019 to test and see what kind of material it is whether it's organic or not so here we're in the second level and finally this is yousef are we on in the third level it's down a further 60 feet so that means the Osiris shaft as far as we can tell goes at least 200 feet into the bedrock he grew up across the street from the Sphinx and this was the first time he had ever been in the Osiris shaft and finally this is showing you the weathering of the Sphinx enclosure you see the vertical weathering had to have been the result of precipitation and so far at least 200 geologists have stated it has to be water erosion and that means that the Sphinx enclosure was carved out at least 8,000 to 10,000 years ago and that is at least a few thousand years before the existence of the dynastic Egyptians and finally something you get to see if you go inside the enclosure is the fact that there is an access point near the back of the rump and there's a ladder inside taking you under the Giza Plateau", "OEkRpO5XQd8": "", "rmVz9dsMWNU": "hi this is Fred and this is my bar and these are five Easy Bar magic tricks if you like this video please click on the link below and at the end of this video please look for all of my other bar and restaurant related videos thanks for watching okay for this first trick what you're going to need is you're going to need a dime like it heads up two pieces of paper and a high bowl or a rocks glass and first let me show you the trick and then I'm going to show you how to do it and by the way this always works good that's why this bar magic is people are usually drinking at the bar and it works so much better when someone's had a a couple drinks in them all right here we go  with the dango  right there all right let's do it again  one more time if you haven't seen it  alright let's put it back real quick alright so pretty easy trick it's not really magic at all what you've done is you've taken a highball glass and you've put a piece of paper on it like that too to make it look white and then when you put it over the dime magically Boop the dime disappears so it's all how you move your hand and how you cover it to make it look like it's vanishing so I like doing it that way I've seen other people put a towel on top of it and half the glass and then the time disappears but this is how I learned it and enjoy all right for this for this next trick you're gonna need two regular straws let's give them editor plastic oh actually I have one large and one small straw let me go fix that let me get it actually will do with this so I want straw that's slightly bigger than the other but that's no problem so let me show you the trick and then I'm going to show you how I did it I'm gonna take this draw us I'm gonna tangle it tie that one around that one that's one around that one and now you've got the two straws totally intertwined Alakazam and the two straws are not broken and yet they're apart pretty cool magic trick not really magic let's show you how to do it for this trick you got the your two straws you're going to then take the first drum and make it t put your thumb there and you're gonna wrap it around too completely so it actually looks like bent just show you so you see how that's around that and just show you the bottom just like that so then you're gonna take this next one the bottom piece you're gonna wrap it to the right all the way around and come back and grab it like that then gonna take these two and just pull them over like this what it's actually doing is its untying itself so it looks like a mangled not there and then you should twist slowly twist come right apart super magic but not it's actually a really cool trick and anybody anytime anybody tries it they really get it tangled in a knot so pretty cool trick for this next trick it's a it's a card trick and this is the easiest card trick I know it's probably the very first card trick I learned when I was like 6 so I guess I wasn't even in the restaurant of our industry yet so I'm gonna just shuffle our car and then you're going to you know have your person they pick literally randomly pick any card so they pick what's just a card deck down that's your car don't let don't show it to me that's your car so then they put it on top of the deck you're gonna take the deck you're gonna put it behind your back you're gonna show them the card and say is that your card and they're gonna say no it's not you go okay so you put it back 100 you're back you cut the deck just say is that your card and they're gonna say no it's not so then you're gonna say okay give the car you give the deck to the person you're doing to trick trick to and they're gonna shuffle it or do whatever they want you can tell them to shuffle it you know look through the deck to make sure you didn't mark the deck or mark the card you can shuffle it a million times whatever and then they'll look for the card in the deck they'll give it back to you and say yes their cards in there you can cut it again or do it every one and you're going to flip through the deck and try to find their card  and then you know once you have it set up you're gonna say you know what was your card and they're gonna say it was the seven of clubs and you go yes it was so a pretty easy trick I'm gonna show you how I do it but I'm gonna show you from my my side my view I'm actually going to show you this way cuz I can't seem to get my camera to to move from there so you're literally gonna shuffle the deck and there are randomly gonna pick any card in the deck so you hold the card they could pick whatever one they want so let's say it's that card so they're gonna look at the card which I'm gonna show you and then they're gonna here and put it on the deck so they're gonna put it on the deck when you put the deck behind your back so now this is behind your back you're just gonna take the top card and flip it so you see the card which their card is the six of diamonds but when you show them and you pull it behind your back you're gonna show them the bottom card on the deck and say is that your card and as you're looking as they're looking at this card you're looking at that card so you can see it and then you go okay so that's not your card they don't know when you put the deck behind your back you're just simply gonna flip that card and just cut the deck you actually already know what they're they're carter's then you show them and say is that their car and they're gonna say no you're gonna say here right it's not your card put the deck down let them flip through it let them shuffle let them cut you already know what their card is and then you do you know whatever you want to get the car to the top of the deck go whichever way you may may want to get the card so I personally like flipping through it and you know making a few cuts when I see their card and I get it in my hand I just cut it to the top so it's right there and when I cut it I just put it on the top of the deck now do a couple more and then when I put it down and say what was your card and they go who is the six of diamonds there's their card and literally you know what the card was before you gave him the deck okay for my next trick and by far this is my favorite trick of them all and if it works it really knocks the socks off people so for this trick you're going to need to make a pyramid of fives so you have 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 s & 5 fives and what you're going to do is ask your friend who you know when we're doing this completely concentrate it's gonna sound funny we're gonna need you to say the fives outlaw out loud the row but in the middle of everything I'm gonna stop ask you a question and you need to give me the very first answer related to the question that pops in your head and like I said if this works it works and it makes them go crazy so so what you're gonna do we can actually try this at home or you could try this at home I'm gonna point to a row and then you are going to say the row out loud and then I'm gonna start from the top and go straight down and then I'm gonna randomly pick and like I said in the middle of it I'm gonna ask you a question and you're going to answer the question so again you need to really concentrate on this for this to work so let's start at the top yeah 555 555-5555 and 55555 five thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five five five hundred and fifty five fifty five thousand 555-5555 five five hundred fifty five fifty five five thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five 555 555 thousand 555 555-5555 thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five five what's the first vegetable that comes to your so then I'm gonna hold this up and say now if that worked on you whoo and then if they say another word which is another vegetable that has that color which would be tomato it works really good it's a great trick I'm going to tell you how this works and how I said how I you know set it up you're gonna actually have the fives and you are really going to randomly pick fives so from what I have been told the number 5 is related to the color orange in your head so when you're just thinking about 5s 555 555 and the rows of 5 and then you ask them a question what's the first vegetable that comes to their mind pretty much 70% of the time they say carrot or tomato so carrot being the number one answer tomato being the number two answer so what I usually do is put carrot I have it written on a piece of paper have it in my right pocket and I have tomato written on a piece of paper in my left pocket and if they say a carrot and you pull it out it just totally blows their mind if they say tomato same thing it totally blows their mind now like I said it works 70 percent of the time but when it works it's amazing so give it a shot on your friends but remember they need complete concentration all right for this this next trick you're going to need a a pen in a piece of paper so I only need one so what you're gonna do is ask your friend and this could be a this is a very good group trick if you have more than one person two three four people it works but since I'm here by myself we're going to use a deck of cards here to randomly pick a four-digit number so we have a deck of cards and we're just gonna flip through and say okay to can't use jank I see one two four six clean seven so two four six seven is our number two four six seven now being the magician than I am I'm going to write the answer down right now before the trick is over I'm going to write down  right that's the answer hold this over  I'm gonna leave it right where everybody can see right okay so now for the second part of the trick to continue we already have the answer written down you're gonna ask another person for a four digit number so let's pick some cards  Jack we got eight ten five so we're gonna use the ten in that one I should have used those as ten so we have a eight one zero five and let's pick a few more numbers three nine eight so three nine eight four all right three nine eight four so those are all the random numbers that that we've picked or your your friends have given you I'm just again using a deck of cards to to make this work so now I am going to use my exquisite math math my exquisite magical skills to to make this work so I'm going to pick a four digit number myself I'm going to pick one eight nine four and the next number I'm going to pick is six zero one five and now let's add these up and hopefully when I add all of these these five digits up they're going to total the magical answer so let's try this so we've got 10 18 25 we got 1026 we've got 1024  we've got 1022 so the answer I came up with is 2222 462 let's see if the magical answer  see if you can see that one two two four six two so I'm gonna show you how to do this trick now actually I have a Freudian slip before it is mathematics it is a mathematic trip so let me show you how to do it now you're going to ask your your friend for a four-digit number and if it's a group you could ask someone for two digits and another two person for two digits the only rule is the four digit number they give you can't end in 1 or 0 it cannot end in 1 or 0 so I'm going to use 6 5 4 3 as a number so there's your starting number and now you're going to write the answer down to get the answer what you're going to do is you're going to subtract 2 from the final number and put that 2 in the front so the magic answer for this one would be 2 6 5 4 1 so again 2 6 5 4 1 will be the answer I'm gonna write that down on another piece of paper 2 6 5 4 1 so that is going to be the answer to this trick now you're gonna ask them for another four digit number and then you know first you're gonna wrap that up and say okay I have the magical answer if you can put it in someone's pocket you can put it on the you know on the bar under a glass so there you go and then you're going to ask for another four digit number so they can give you it at this point time you could use any numbers you want so one six seven two and another number could be five three one four so now for this next part what you're going to do is each one of these numbers individually you're going to make equal nine in your four numbers so for the first number I'm looking at as this one so my number is going to be eight the next number is six so my number is going to be three seven my number will be two and two my number will be seven so let me just show you how that looks 8/3 - seven okay so and now I'm going to make this next line the next four digits one two three four those I'm going to individually make equal nine so five is going to be 4 3 is going to be six one will be eight four will be five so let me write that down to show you so we've got four six eight five and just to show you arrows these are the numbers then I'm making equal 9 the reason I do it this way is so they can't see the way I'm making it equal 9 if you do all their numbers in a row so you're making this number equal 9 7 2 and then this number you're gonna make 5 plus 1 equals 9 4 3 plus what equals 9 6 etc etc now if we add this all up it should equal our magic number so so we've got 10 21 you've got 10 24  we've got let's see 6:12 21 22 23 24 25 this last one we have that city can 25:26 so that's the magical answer - six five four one and surprisingly - six five four one magic or mathematics well thanks for watching we appreciate it remember if you like this video please click on the link below and at the end of this video which is right now please look for all of my other restaurant and bar related videos again thank you for watching and remember new video every week subscribe  you", "Xg37L5z5r_M": "[Music] so we're gonna give you five small challenges and you're gonna have three minutes to complete each one and you can give up any time within those three minutes but we're going to make a bet with you for every challenge that you successfully complete you can ask the prefix to do something for you but for every challenge that you fail we get to ask you to do something so do you accept is this gonna get thirty thousand views  make sense the challenge okay yeah sure place for matches like this and challenge your friends to create a square by moving just one match [Music]  nope that's cheating I'm only but you've one of them nope Jenny will spawn for me I don't maybe it's because it stands on the table I'm not singing it so I mean if I do this matter what size the squares okay no cheater  yeah swear him in on there you go yeah you got it  okay yeah yes to win the band move this match creating a tiny square in the center there are one two three four coins in this room and one two three four five coins in this room your friends have to move just one point and end up with five coins in each row I  want to take the first two heads to just soak it in  so you need five minutes show yeah  what if I did something like that this makes no sense to me I'm telling you I'm very straight down there's only nine questions and that's boring for can't I just know that doesn't work Rachel do you give up Rachel do you give up me do you give up Rachel help me so it's this one of the points there's five okay done if I did this or no if I lifted the coin yeah  the secret is simple it's eleven matchsticks the road explain to your friends they have to move five of them to create nine plus something like that well that's not nine well I'm gonna  create the number nine to create nine  it's an obscure challenge to create a nine no no no you have nine and five sticks okay but I need the number nine I did what you asked you have to admit I did what you asked oh the word nine okay when they give up explain it really easy just move these five matchsticks and you end up with the word spent involves six glasses but liquid in these three and leave the other three empty explained your friend has to rearrange the glasses so they run full empty full empty full empty but they're only allowed to move one block  [Music]  you want to move 100 I'm optimistic but I would not call that fall yeah when they give up simply pick up this glass pour the liquid into here replace it and you've won the bet the glass with water and challenge your friends to float a paperclip on top of the liquid okay I use the tested  come on monkey could do this it's just physics surface tension so I put this in one throw I want to make like a flipping contraption hanging it from the sides is cheating I need a copy  are you kidding okay already yeah  Wow surface tension oh yeah baby oh yeah go B this is good surface tension it's not rocket science come on kick it seriously every time they play something into the glass you'll sink to the bottom the secret is to form one of the paper clips into an L shape then balance another paper clip from the arm of the L and carefully place the entire arrangement onto the top of the water amazingly the paper clip [Music]", "g72SmMdFBpk": "I don\u2019t care if you will live or die, I really do not care. It is tough to hear from someone you don't know well, (Laughter) But imagine if you hear this from someone you love. On the twenty-fourth of February 2012, I was diagnosed with throat cancer late. in this night, I came home and sat at the table with my daughter and wife, I am trying to conceal fear And I inform them about upcoming actions. Then I pushed my daughter away from the table and said: \"I don't care if you will live or die.\" There was a lot of anger and screaming through the closed doors, And tonight while I was trying to sleep, It made me think about it, and I started thinking: \"Why don't you see what you gave her and what you did for her?\" I was a radio journalist, One day, I was a news anchor on a big show. And I became a reporter. Then I became a reporter in foreign countries, and we traveled around the world. We moved from the county prairie frost to the warmth of Sydney, Australia, To be able to cover Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. She couldn't understand how she hadn't seen what she had given her, But while I was lying and steeped in my beliefs, I began to see the truth, and the truth was ... That I couldn't remember the last time she embraced her and made her feel safe, Or the last time I told her how proud I was, Or the last time I said to her, \"I love you.\" And I suddenly realized that the cancer had already reached beyond my throat. After a few weeks I was in the hospital To perform what doctors call a radical neck resection: They grabbed the scalpel and began cutting behind the right ear Even below the Adam's apple, he was wounded 12 inches long. They had to remove a golf-sized tumor. And while I was recovering, And I pray to a god I did not believe in, \"Let me finish what I am,\" The surgeon came and told me it was not over, And that I have to undergo chemotherapy and radiation for several weeks. Back then, I felt I needed to be close to people; Because I was more afraid than ever, And I decided to go for chemotherapy and radiation sessions on my own And I miss an opportunity to tell my wife and daughter: \"I'm so scared, please go with me.\" I was longing to be near them, but I was pushing them away to die anyway. (Sigh) I used to go to radiotherapy every day, I couldn\u2019t go home to find myself surrounded by four walls, So I started going to the downtown areas to drown in a sea of \u200b\u200bpeople I hope this distracts me and takes me away About the thought that broke out inside my head That my departure is drawing near. We are said to be: \"When we are ready to learn, then the teacher will appear,\" But I did not know that this teacher would be a homeless homeless man. I remember the first time I saw him He was miserable and sits on a piece of cardboard at a busy intersection With his little dog sitting next to him and next to him a large banner reading \"Help me.\" And when I first saw him, the first thing I thought about was: \"How dare you? You must look for a job. how dare you? You are not a victim more than me. Look at me, I have cancer and I will probably die. I have been with young children in chemotherapy sessions. They are the victims, not you. \" During the following days, I was watching him while I was walking back and forth, and I was trying to engage people, I have never seen him reach out or beg anyone in public Or behaving aggressively, But he seemed nice, and he greeted and greeted the people around him. And one day, on my way home, You are on the same side of the road as you sit. Normally, I would have crossed the other side to avoid facing it, Or maybe to avoid prejudices about it, But today I said, \"No, I'm going to go.\" And when I started getting close to him, His little dog got up, stood in front of me Then he sat down and looked at me in a friendly look. (Laughter) I extended my hand to him and raised him, and then I turned to the man. Without thinking, she spoke freely and asked him bod: \"What is his name?\" He laughed and said: \"Okay, you mean what her name is, and her name is Molly.\" (Laughter) \"It usually doesn't stop people unless they need something. What do you need? Well, I wish I was so good in my thoughts ... (Laughter) The first thing in my mind is: \"A good trick. It manipulates my heart and evokes my feelings.\" (Laughter) Instead, I told him, \"She must have known that I needed a cute dog to play with him today.\" And she walked away. I was confused; I was confused about a lot of things. The day after radiotherapy, I realized I wanted to go back To replace it, do something, or find out something. I wanted to give him something, but not money Because we know what happens when we give someone a money beggar, He will spend it on drugs or alcohol. I stopped to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee And some biscuits for Molly, When I got close to him, he waved at me and said, \"I see you came back again for Molly.\" I was about to give him food and things, But he preceded me and reached out to shake hands with me. Meanwhile, he started talking to me As if we have known each other for a long time. I sat with him and gave him a sandwich, so he told me: \"I will only take it if we share it.\" Spanish poet Kivedo once wrote: \"The misery goes away when we share the bread.\" There was no misery on this day. We sat down and spoke as old comrades and for a moment I forgot that I was sick. After a little while, he reached out to his bag and pulled out a small box of grain, His hands were shaking and he couldn't open it, so I offered him to open it. He gave it to me, so I looked and found his name on it, Douglas. The name of the medicine was \"Largactel\". Which is used for people with schizophrenia, And I thought that meant he was definitely a mentally disturbed serial killer ... (Laughter) What is that? This is an internal prison, People get very little government support, We ignore them and brand them. I turned to him and said, \"Is this why you are begging?\" He looked at me and said, \"What? No, I'm here to raise money to help those in need. \" He pointed to the sign. Under the big sign \"Help Me\", which I didn't notice, There were the names of the groups for which he raised money. Suddenly, I realized that he was not the helpless person, but me. Because the judgment I made on it I was blinded by the fact that this man is kind. And I saw him a lot later. I remember that one day He had a wide smile on his face and waved his hand. He reached out to his bag to take a small box of chocolates, I ignored it because it's a cheap kind of candy, But I knew from him that she had a lot of money. So I extended my hand to the box, shook his hand and said: \"thank you my friend.\" And he started to tear, so I said, \"What's wrong with you, Doug?\" He said, \"I have no friends, Of course, I don\u2019t have important friends like you. \u201d I lived my life trying to be an important person, With TV cameras and admission. In my life, I have never felt a more important person than I did at that moment. Because I was important just because I was with him. And I told him I will only take chocolate if we share it, as we always do. We sat down And he opened them with great happiness. And while we were sitting, I was looking at a group of people passing by. Humans have places to go, people to meet and things to do, And human beings I thought I was like them, Humans were looking at us as though we were below them. I wanted to be like this for a long time, and have this vision from above, But now, as I sit down, And I eat the best chocolate I've ever had, I realize that the best vision I have is now. Sydney, Australia, is a bit cold in winter. I used to walk the city streets one winter day, wearing a coat. When I got to Doug, Lee put a milk box upside down and sat on it. Molly went up and put her paws on my knees, So I carried it, attracted me, and opened my coat, It was the first time I had exposed the long scar that was on my neck. Doug said: \"What is this?\" So I began to explain to him about cancer. He said to me, \"I know you will be okay.\" And I said, \"I feel kind of okay, I've started radiation and treated.\" He grabbed my arm, and I turned toward it So he said, \"No, you will be fine, You have a lot to do. \" I have never felt a sense of expression in my life, But I got confused that day. So I did what men do When we are touched and afraid that we will cry in front of everyone; I breathed and turned my head and tried to swallow my tears. And he was cute, and he did just as I did. We sat there, inhale, back and forth. (Laughter) I think sometimes we ... We say the best things when we don't exchange words, We just exchange places. I had to leave, But I didn't want to say goodbye to him, so I said, \"I'll see you later.\" He waved his hand and smiled. Molly stood up and sculpted for the first time. I walked this street that day with tears streaming from my eyes, Not because I was afraid or angry, but because I was happy. Because for the first time in my life, or for the first time since I had cancer, I realized that I would live. For the first time in my life, I felt I had a real goal. The next day she underwent chemotherapy. Well, chemotherapy has a way to erase any positive energy inside you. You are slowly feeding on a venomous droplet inside your body. To make matters worse, That there was a little girl sitting in front of me with a nurse next to her, She was combing horse hair game. She wore a scarf to cover her bald head, Her skin looked green, and she looked defeated. I did not want to see it Nor can I look far. Suddenly, My cute pass came when I closed my eyes, And I remembered when I was a toddler, My closest friend Rob Austin, the class clown was doing some facial expressions, She turned to her and did this ... (Laughter) This is more reaction than what I got from it. (Laughter) Do you know what small children look like when they think you are really a stranger? Well, this was how she looked at me. (Laughter) The logical thing was to turn around and pretend that this didn't happen, but ... This would have required a smart person, And I didn't say in this conversation that I'm smart. So I did the same thing again. This time I saw that her stomach started spinning until she reached her chest. I was wondering if you would feel sick and vomit, but ... (Laughter) I started to laugh. And the little boy's laugh becomes contagious, So I exploded with laughter. The nurses came from the other rooms They also started to laugh. I realized I had to see Doug and tell him: \"You're right, I still have a lot to do.\" The next day, I went back again to the city center, But he is gone. he was not there. I didn't think much, I just hoped to find a paradox. So I came back day after day, I went back for weeks, But he was not there. So I asked store owners if they had seen him, Most of them used to say: \"The homeless move to better places.\" I was calling the institutions, They were saying that they would not be able to tell me anything because of the laws protecting privacy. night, At the time I devoted it to thinking And fear about my death, I started to think about it and wonder: Was he robbed? Was he transferred to the hospital? Was he put under security surveillance? And I started thinking about Molly. Was it in a shelter? Was she about to kill her compassionately? I wanted to tell you about Doug And to give you all kinds of wonderful metaphors about what it means for me And how it will become part of the great transformation in my life, And I wanted to tell you how great it made me, But then I realized That day I was not prepared to tell Doug the full story. With the chemotherapy session that day, We had to get our seats apart Because every time we were looking at each other, we were laughing. Chemotherapy sessions continue, and you don't laugh; It kills you. The chemotherapy made me emotional, shed some tears, and I felt bitter, But I knew I couldn't leave that day, I thought I was leaving before, Before I tell her anything It could have been important and saved. When I finished the chemotherapy session, I went to her and sat cross-legged in front of her, And I looked at her face to face, and I must have looked miserable I was shaking and I felt the sweat coming out of my head. I was trying to come up with great words, And when she did, she looked at me and tipped her head, With a sympathetic view Which you can distinguish from a parent, and not from a young child, Then she reached out I put it on my cheeks to comfort me. I was the child at the time, and suddenly I started crying, She wiped tears from my face. The hardest thing was to get out there. When she looked back, she was there combing horse hair again. After several weeks, I was in chemotherapy, and I saw her nurse, so I said: \"Did you see her? How is she?\" The nurse came and told me that she had died. I thought that God took the wrong person on this day. Her story and Doug's tale have been in my heart for a long time. I began to realize that I was not afraid of death, I was afraid throughout my life. I began to realize That we all will die in a moment, But we can live a million wonderful moments And full of enthusiasm, pain, love, anxiety and anger And anything we want, And I lived half a century I avoid any negative feelings and try to distance myself For the poor, the needy and the miserable. I tried to surround myself with the rich, famous, and powerful, And I think if I become with them, I can live with this kind of safe happiness, And if you feel guilty about the homeless, Then I can wait until I make more money than I need To give them some of what I owned. But here, in my most miserable moments, So two people I've been avoiding all my life, A homeless man and a little girl, And who I thought had little to offer them, but they had given me so much. There was a lot to do, But it is not within him that he saved other people, Rather, much of what I had to do was to see others, To receive them, And give them strength to treat others. I also started the path of penance in my life with my daughter. When I was asked to make this conversation, I felt proud and humbled, But I was afraid that I was not worth it. Normally in the past, I would have told millions of people about this and would post about it, But I haven't told anyone for several weeks, except that I phoned my wife Marina She cried with me on the phone. Then I called my little girl. Now living across the country in Australia. She goes to school, She will be a teacher for children in early childhood, It will be the best because it is really good at it And her heart is big. And I told her, The same little girl who was not interested in whether I would live or die, She said to me: Dad, I'm very proud of you. And you will do all good, And I love you, Dad. \" thank you. (clap)", "Rat1n34l_wI": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs Reviewer: Peter van de Ven So, take a look at these behaviors: Does Math Gets High Gets Stressed Out And Rocks Out To Music What's the first that comes to mind? Does it sound like - I heard \"college,\" yeah. (Laughter) I was thinking more of a teenager. It does sound like a teenager. But what if I told you that your skin - take a look at it, that very colorful sheath covering your body - that your skin can perform all of these behaviors. Now, before I give you the \"skinny\" on the teenage-like behavior of skin, I want to show you how I got to examining the radical behavior of skin. It started during the economic recession, which is where I found myself in my first job - an unlikely time for a first job. So how did this happen? Well, there was an alarming trend: There was a rise in skin sensitivity. And that meant more people in the dermatologist's office and more people in the facialist's chair. And there was a rise in skin conditions like inflammatory conditions, like eczema and psoriasis. And we didn't know exactly why, but a lot of people in the industry thought maybe it was the rise in stress; maybe it was a lifestyle thing; maybe it was pollution. But I wanted to know how. So when I started working in the skincare industry, I asked myself: How does something as globally extreme like the economy, how does that translate to something like a skin rash? You see, I'm a neuroscientist, and in studying the skin, I found that there was just as much neuroscience in studying the skin as there was in studying the brain. And that was actually surprising to me. So I want to show you some stories today that are going to explain how this connection between the mind and body interact and hopefully surprise you with some of the ideas that came about in understanding the connection between the brain and the skin. So I want to share with you first some examples of the curious ways in which our minds are represented on our exterior. This is Jack. Jack is a veteran pilot. He has been through it all. He's been through wind gusts and locked landing gear. He can keep his cool in just about any situation. But every time he flies over a particular canyon, his forehead breaks out in herpes blisters, every single time he flies over that canyon. Naturally, he goes to the doctor, gets a medicine, and it treats his symptoms, but it just keeps coming back every time he flies over that canyon. And this is Sophie. Sophie is a senior in high school, and she's a dancer. And, of course, as any senior in high school, she's trying to decide what she's going to do with her life. \"Am I going to go to college?\" \"Will I continue to dance?\" \"Will I dance in college?\" \"What college am I going to go to?\" So as she battles with her indecision, she develops a wart on the bottom of her foot. Of course, like Jack, she goes to try to get some medical treatment, and it does treat the symptoms here and there, but it always comes back. She can't get rid of this wart. And in the end, the wart makes the decision for her. She can no longer pursue dancing because of the pain in her foot. And this is Danny. Danny is ten years old, and he was born with eczema, so he was used to the medications, he was used to the rashes that came and went, but the medications always kept his skin rashes at bay. But one day, they stopped working. The medicine was no longer good. The medicine stopped working the day his mother tragically died in a car accident. Cases like these are not few and far between. In fact, they simply highlight the interdependence between our emotional state and our body state. A blush inadvertently reveals our mind's secrets. Goose bumps warn us when something is wrong. And we feel crawling skin when we're paralyzed with fear. Our skin has the machinery, the same machinery as the brain. And it's only been a decade or so of research that shows that the skin has the most intricate and sophisticated systems that were once under the sole domain of the brain. So for instance, the stress axis - the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis - found in our central nervous system is also found in the skin, and it's theorized that this stress pathway actually evolved in the skin first to avoid pathogens from entering the skin. But stress is more than skin deep. You don't have to know anything about this man to know that something happened to him between the first picture and the last picture on the right. This is a photograph from a series by photographer Claire Felicie, who took picture of Dutch marines before, during, and after deployment to Afghanistan. You can see the changes from the first picture to the last picture, and this is only in one year. This is not due to the effects of normal chronological aging. So whether it's war, divorce, losing your job, any stressful situation, this often shows up on our skin first. But we so often dismiss that as unimportant and superficial. And when we miss these cues that our bodies are desperately trying to tell us, it's tantamount to repressing emotion. So I want you to close your eyes for a second and imagine that you're blind. Okay. Now you can open your eyes, and plug your nose, and imagine that you can't smell. Okay, I think we can all kind of do that. Now, sit there with your bottoms firmly pressed against the chair, feet flat on the ground, and imagine your can't feel. That's pretty tough. So what is that? Our sense of touch begins in the womb. It's nearly impossible to not feel, even when you try. So touch began in the womb; it's the first sensory system to develop. And as psychology has taught us, Maslow taught us that monkeys, in fact, baby monkeys preferred mechanical mothers covered in terry cloth. But today we know that scientific research is showing that this particular mother's touch, this caress, actually changes her child's epigenetic programming. So that kind of research shows us that there has to be something more to this touch, in particular, this gentle touch. So recently, Swedish neuroscientists discovered a new set of nerve fibers in the skin that respond to only the most gentle of touches. To give you a little bit of perspective, in the body, the nerve impulses can outrace a Ferrari. That means they can travel at speeds faster than 250 miles per hour. That's pretty fast. But these touch fibers in the skin, they're slow, they take their time. They travel at a leisurely stroll of about two miles per hour to reach the brain. And, unlike their quick signals that reach the somatosensory cortex and tell us what we've touched, the details of what we've touched, these slow signals travel to a different part of the brain that processes emotions and tells us what we feel when we touch. And this part of the brain is called the posterior insular cortex. And so we know that this gentle touch gives us a sense of who we are, and it also gives us a sense of who we are in the greater world. So if you stimulate another part of the brain called the angular gyrus - this part of the brain is also stimulated by gentle touch - if you stimulate this in somebody, you will trigger an out-of-body experience in that person. And that means that the gentle touch fiber is somehow reflected in our personal sense of self, and our sense of culture and who we are in the community. And so we wear our culture on our hands. And on to my final point - and I saved this for last because I thought it was a cool story. So, let me tell you a little bit about touch and sound. The story started about 15 years ago, and there was a mixer for new faculty at Rice University. And at Rice University, there were new faculty, some of them were from all departments, and there was a neuroscientist. And the neuroscients struck up a conversation with a philosopher about things like the fallability of science and the way that the brain organizes and orchestrates all of the flood of sensory information that goes into the brain and puts it into a coherent perception. You know, simple things like that. So it turns out that the philosopher had suffered a stroke, and that had left her with a strange mixing of her senses. And at this point, the neuroscientist said, \"Yeah, let\\'s look at your brain.\" So in one experiment, she sat with her hands on the table and two rings, and the rings were dotted with electrodes. And these electrodes were transmitting some electrical pulses that followed a beep or a tone. And she had these in each of her middle fingers. So she had her hands down, and she was to hear the tone and then feel a little tingle on either hand. And she was to say which hand she felt the tingle in. But here's the rub: She kept feeling tingles even when they didn't deliver any electrical shock. And so, of course, the neuroscientist was very confused and said, \"We shock; she feels. We don't shock; she still feels. What is going on?\" So after a while, and I mean a while, I think it was over a year, he kind of had an idea: Could she possibly be reacting to the tone that came before the shock? And so he did another very scientific experiment. He simply asked her. \"Do you feel sounds? Can you feel and sense sounds?\" And she said, \"Oh yeah. All the time. Ever since the stroke.\" (Laughter) So, fast forward ten years, and Dr. Rowe's research found that her mixing of senses was due to the fact that her auditory area had gone over the somatosensory cortex, which was its neighbor in the brain. And so her sound and touch senses were mixed. And so that shows us that, of course, there's brain plasticity, but that there's a very deep connection between sound and touch. In fact, some scientists today believe that the sense of hearing actually evolved from the sense of touch. Think about the hair cells in your inner ear. So, imagine what it feels like to sense so many sounds in such a loud and busy world. How did she deal with it? Well, she took up the bass guitar. Because the soft, deep sounds felt like a massage over her body. Not too long ago, we thought that the brain function was hard-wired, localized, and that damage to the brain was pretty much permanent. We know that's not true today. The paradigm shift that occurred was neuroplasticity in the brain. And skin is this very thin and seemingly disposable tissue. But I want to flip this inside out. If the brain has plasticity, and if the skin is like the brain, could the skin also have plasticity? And does that mean that the skin has untapped potential that we are not aware of? Could we sense extrasensory things like infrared through our skin? Actually, mouse research suggests that we can. And could we maybe get superhuman hearing by sending vibrations to our fingertips? Forget the Apple watch; your skin has a clock of its own, and it can keep time. We actually have an incredible, wearable sensor that can tell time, and it's a shield and a communicator, and we don't even know it. So, how did these stories end? Now, they all came from different walks of life, and they did share one common theme: They had one problem that was unresolved. So their unresolved emotion led to something on the skin. And fortunately for these people, who are real people, by the way, they're patients, some of them are patients of a psychologist in Boston, Jack, for example, went to see a hypnotherapist. And in that, he revealed that his friend had actually died in that canyon. But his friend was a pilot, and Jack was supposed to be the one flying that day, but he called in sick, and instead his friend flew over that canyon, and he died. So Jack felt extremely, extremely guilty. And it wasn't until he was able to speak about his feelings in this way that his breakouts on his forehead never came back. Sophie also underwent hypnosis and revealed that her wart had been giving voice to something that she was afraid to do herself, which was to say, \"I no longer want to dance.\" And after she understood that, her wart went away for good. And Danny went to see a psychodermatologist, and he also had a different form of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and through this he was able to battle with the fact that his mother had died and that made his skin worse, and after the therapy, three weeks later, his lesions healed. So conventional medicine did not treat these people in the right way, in a way where they fully, fully recovered. Conventional medicine treated the symptoms for a little bit, but it did nothing for the long term. Now, we can continue to put out little fires here and there, but it's not until you find the source of the problem where you can really get rid of your issue. So, I love the idea of the hummingbird effect. The hummingbird effect is something where an idea in one place strikes another idea, completely unrelated sometimes, in a totally different field. And in this case, do ideas and innovations unfold in this matter, and if they do, does the idea that the skin has a brain of its own unfold in this way, and could that trigger new discoveries in other areas? Especially if we know that the skin could have untapped potential that we know nothing about yet. And so imagine how understanding these discoveries could change technology and medicine. Twenty years ago, Dr. Michael Gershon revealed that there was a brain in the gut. Today, if you go to a grocery store, difficult to find a grocery store without probiotic drinks or probiotic supplements. And today, I'm telling you that the skin also has a mind of its own. And so, for decades we've known that the brain controls the body, but if we now know that the body greatly influences the mind, and we see these in cases like the person that develops an actual clinical depression or anxiety due to a very visible disorder, or the anorexia patient that gets better after wearing a tight body suit, or the power one feels when they're wearing a white lab coat. Embodied cognition is not a new idea, but it's finally gaining steam in ways that doctors and therapists can finally implement. And so many people live disembodied nowadays. They tell you that they disconnect themselves from the body. But when we mind the body, we know our sense of self. And so, as these ideas unfold, it'll take some time for them to reach an everyday life. So I want to leave you with this: to listen to your skin. Thank you. (Applause)", "e_TjrqWTV5s": "[\u266aINTRO] Throughout our planet\u2019s history, billions of species have gone extinct. In fact, over 99% of the species that have ever existed, don\u2019t anymore. Some of them disappeared long ago, leaving behind the occasional fossil to study. Others went the way of the dodo and were killed off either directly or indirectly by humans. But every once in a while, a creature we thought had kicked the bucket is found \u2026 still kicking. Here are seven animals that turned out to not be extinct after all. One of the most well-known examples of this phenomenon is the coelacanth, a kind of simple fish. Until the 1930s, we\u2019d only seen it in fossils, and the fossil record suggested it died off not long before the non-avian dinosaurs did, over 65 million years ago. But then, in 1938, a museum curator named Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer discovered a live specimen someone had fished off the coast of South Africa. These days, we know of two different living species of coelacanth, one in the western Indian Ocean, and the other in waters near Indonesia. They\u2019ve been so hard to find because they tend to live between about 150-250 meters down, in the ocean\u2019s twilight zone. Which, despite the name, is not a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind. It\u2019s just pretty dim down there. On top of that, coelacanths also gather in caves during the day, only to leave at night to feed. But now that we\u2019ve found them, we\u2019ve learned that they\u2019re kind of awesome. The coelacanths we\u2019ve found are nearly identical to fossils hundreds of millions of years old, so they have a lot of anatomical features we\u2019ve never found in modern animals. For example, they have a hinge inside their skull that\u2019s unique among all living vertebrates. It allows the back of their skulls to swing upwards, so they can basically open their mouths super wide. So basically they\u2019s be perfect dental patients, if they weren\u2019t fish. I mean, I don\u2019t know\u2026. Maybe they have tooth problems. Coelacanths are also the only living fish to have seven lobed fins \u2014 and we only know of one other living fish with lobed fins at all, the lungfish. Four of the coelacanth\u2019s fins are paired up, and they move similarly to how land-based animals might move their legs. Because of this, scientists used to think that the coelacanth could be the so-called \u201cmissing link\u201d between sea and land animals, but genetic sequencing has debunked that. The role most likely goes to the lungfish, which is the coelacanth\u2019s closest relative. But don\u2019t worry, coelacanths. We still think you\u2019re special. Like the coelacanth, we used to think the Kha-nyou, or Laotian Rock Rat, was long gone. But instead of being found by fishermen, this animal was spotted at a meat market. In the late 1990s, two scientists visiting Laotian meat markets independently identified what appeared to be a new species of rodent. The animal, which looked like an adorable cross between a squirrel and a large rat, was a regular on the market menu, but it took nearly a decade to confirm what it really was. In fact, the first photographs of a living Laotian Rock Rat weren\u2019t captured until 2006. Based on initial DNA testing, scientists first thought the creature was part of a brand new taxonomic family, one most closely related to guinea pigs, African mole rats, and porcupines. But within a year, new analyses revealed that it was actually the only living species from its taxonomic family Diatomyidae, which disappeared from the fossil record around 11 million years ago. Today, the rodent is mostly found in Central Laos, but a smaller population has also been found in Vietnam. Both groups live in the crevices of limestone towers in forests. So, that might explain why they\u2019re hard to find. Since they\u2019re so rare, most of what we know about the species comes from analyzing bushmeat samples and talking to the locals who hunt them. But the scientists are pretty convinced that the rodents are nocturnal and mostly herbivores, although they might occasionally eat insects. If you\u2019re looking for an animal we thought was extinct for a really long time, you might want to try monoplacophorans, a type of mollusk that we thought disappeared around 400 million years ago. And then in 1952, ten live specimens were collected from the seafloor near Costa Rica, over 3500 meters below the surface. After that, researchers realized that monoplacophorans had actually been found before, as early as 1869! But they were all incorrectly identified as limpets, a kind of snail, because of their similar shape. Today, we\u2019ve found around 30 distinct species, and all of them fall into the subcategory Tryblidia. As the name suggests, monoplacophorans have a cap-like shell with just one plate. In fact, their shell microstructure and musculature are basically identical to those found in fossils half a billion years old. But a lot about them, including how they grow and reproduce, and their relationship to other mollusks, is still a big mystery. They\u2019re so simple that researchers once believed they could be the original mollusk, from which all others descended. And because they show signs of segmented organs, they were also seen as a potential missing link between all mollusks and annelids, or segmented worms. They probably aren\u2019t either of those things, though. Newer research suggests that, instead of being the OG mollusk, they\u2019re actually a super specialized branch on the mollusk family tree \u2026 which is only getting more complicated as we learn more about it. Mollusks might be simple, but they\u2019re not the simplest animal on our list. That honor goes to the Neptune\u2019s Cup Sponge, which was first discovered around 1820 off the coast of Singapore\u2026 and was very quickly harvested to extinction. Or so we thought. These sponges could grow to over a meter tall and wide, and their cup-like shape was so convenient that people actually used them as bathtubs for their babies. Because they were so large, they were a valuable collectors item for individuals and museums, and we kept harvesting them until they were almost all gone. The last time anyone recorded a living one was 1907, at least until 2011, when scientists discovered two living specimens in the waters off Singapore\u2019s St. John\u2019s Island. Before then, in the 1990s, we\u2019d seen dead sponges wash up onshore in Australia, so there was some evidence they weren\u2019t extinct after all. But it took over a decade to find these live ones. The two sponges were young, only about 30 centimeters in diameter, which is nowhere near as large as they could grow to be. But they did teach us that these sponges don\u2019t grow as slowly as we used to think. The two young sponges grew several centimeters over just a few months, which is a lot compared to other species of sponge, which only grow that much in a year! As of this May, three more live sponges have been discovered, and to help conserve the species, they\u2019ve been transplanted so that they\u2019re close enough to each other that they can reproduce. It\u2019s safe to say we will not be using them for baby baths any time soon. Or ever. Let\u2019s not make that mistake again. The first fossils of the Mallorcan Midwife Toad were found in 1977, on the island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean. Based on those fossils, researchers thought it had been extinct for a few thousand years, probably because Romans had introduced predatory snakes to the island. But only three years later, we found live ones! Midwife toads are not especially talented at helping others through labor or anything. The name comes from how the males care for fertilized eggs: they carry a string of 7-12 of them wrapped around their hind legs until they hatch. Like a little tadpole fanny pack! These tiny toads only grow to be 4 centimeters long, and they used to be found all over Mallorca. But invasive species have pushed them into the northern mountains, where they live in small streams carved into limestone. Thankfully, active breeding programs across Europe have existed since the mid-1980s, and the first toads bred in captivity were reintroduced to the island in 1989. So far, these conservation efforts have been considered successful, and the toads were even reclassified in 2004, from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable. So things are looking up! Meanwhile, just east of Australia, you\u2019ll find the 10 kilometer-long Lord Howe Island, formerly the home of the creatively named Lord Howe Island Stick Insect. It\u2019s also nicknamed the Land Lobster or Tree Lobster, depending on who you ask. They are not as big as actual lobsters, but they can grow to be 15 centimeters long, or about as big as your hand, which, if you ask me, is bigger than any insect really needs to be. Either way, we thought they\u2019d been wiped out not long after 1918, when a shipwreck on the tiny island introduced a bunch of black rats that would\u2019ve considered stick insects a really tasty snack. But it turns out that about 25 kilometers away, on an even smaller volcanic outcrop called Ball\u2019s Pyramid, a very tiny population survived. And we finally found them in 2001! Unfortunately, Ball\u2019s Pyramid isn\u2019t an ideal environment for them. These insects used to live in forests in the hollows of tree trunks, but there aren\u2019t any forests on the outcrop. Instead, they hide in holes full of plant debris. And they can only feed on one plant that grows there: the tea tree. Which can really be a problematic eating strategy, as pandas have found out the hard way. In 2003, two insects were brought to the Melbourne Zoo to begin a breeding program, and so far, over 14,000 insects have been born there. This year, a new female named Vanessa was brought from Ball\u2019s Pyramid to the zoo for some much-needed extra genetic diversity, and she\u2019s definitely living her best life. She currently has her own $80,000 climate-controlled glass house. But 14,000 insects does not mean the species is saved. With fewer than 30 of them in the wild, the Lord Howe Island Stick Insect is a strong candidate for the world\u2019s rarest insect. And even though Ball\u2019s Pyramid is nearly inhospitable for them, it\u2019s not safe to start reintroducing these critters to Lord Howe Island until conservationists take care of the rat problem, because there are still plenty of those guys running around. So only time will tell if they\u2019ll ever be able to return home. Finally, for our last not-dead-yet animal, we have the Ecuadorian Horned Anole, or \u201cthe Pinocchio lizard.\u201d One look at a male specimen and you will see why. The anoles were first discovered in the 1950s, but the few scientists could find were all male, so they couldn\u2019t tell if the females also supported that impressive nose. And within a decade, all signs of them had vanished. Their suspected extinction was probably caused by deforestation, since the anoles were only found within about 250 square kilometers of forest near the village of Mindo. But in 2005, a group of birdwatchers traveling through the area saw a single, strange lizard crawling along a road. They caught it and snapped some photos, and it was identified as the long-lost Ecuadorian Horned Anole. Several years later, scientists captured specimens for study. They had to go at night because these anoles are super well camouflaged during the day, and they like to hang out high up in trees and creep around very slowly. But at night, they change color and become pale enough that flashlights can pick them out amongst the foliage. So far, we don\u2019t know why they do this, but it is convenient at least. Even though we know they\u2019re alive now, researchers still don\u2019t know much about these lizards. They can actually wiggle their proboscis, but scientists don\u2019t know exactly how they do it. They might have muscles in their snouts, which would make them different from other lizards. Or maybe their bodies pump fluid into and out of them. If nothing else, researchers are pretty confident that the proboscis is used for mating displays, as opposed to, like, fighting other males. That\u2019s partly because they\u2019re super flimsy and would make for terrible nose swords, but also because of directly observing males flourishing them around before getting it on with their partners. We, of course, don\u2019t know exactly how many Ecuadorian Horned Anoles there are, but so few of them have been spotted that they are listed as an endangered species. Hopefully we can keep them and their habitat around long enough to get some answers. No matter what the pressures on these organisms that have pushed them so far out of our grasp that we just thought that they were gone, it\u2019s always an exciting moment for science when a species seems to come back from the dead. Some of them act like little time capsules from Earth\u2019s past, and all of them help us better understand the family tree of life. And hopefully, we will be able to keep them alive and well for years to come. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow!

all day long I don't ask her to ever do math if critics say no wonder she's a genius because she is devoting all her time for art then it would be a better place in the world that there would be more people who are interested in focusing their energy to the fields that they are interested in [Music]  while some geniuses use their talents to create a feast for the eyes others may find that their unique skills are not quite so useful been print more an unemployed accountant from Darby is perhaps an unlikely genius but on today's shopping trip he set himself a challenge [Music] Ben is going to attempt to remember the 13 digit barcode of every item in his basket this means memorizing the order of 130 digits in just 5 minutes most of us can only remember up to 7 new numbers time for Ben to see how far he can go  bacon 5 0 0 0 1 9 2 0 1 4 1 8 7 big pie that's five zero zero zero one nine two two six four three six zero Ben is the UK memory champion and a world record breaker I hold a record for memorizing the most packs of cards in an hour 27 packs and also four binary digits that's ones and zeros I hold the record for memorizing the most of those in 30 minutes 4140 digits garlic bread that's five zero zero zero one nine two zero four three seven seven four yep really it's only since discovering this hobby of mine that I firm well Excel did anything has the Bears sweet five seven zero  three one seven zero four zero five two six  I turned the numbers into pictures we should have at lemons there were a lemon being fed to a sasquatch which is wearing a plastic Mac consumed the pack of sausages and a leg in practice people are either completely nonplussed by it or they think it's extremely cool it's sort of about a 50/50 split I think it's weird that is amazing yeah I can't just I can't even remember Mary shopping this some days I won't if the few people who find this kind of thing really fun [Music] did you tell him your birthday Oh 706 1980 it's a Sunday and this year it's a Sunday you retire in 2045 on a Thursday you'll be 65 in 24 in Salt Lake City Utah everyone knows 56 year-old genius Kim peak April 12 2006 so Wednesday and shall be two years old on Saturday and when can she retired good little girl when you gonna let her retire known by many is the real Rain Man Kim was the inspiration for Dustin Hoffman's character in the oscar-winning film of the same name brain-damaged since birth and a rare condition known as savant syndrome have somehow given Kim an ability to memorize facts and information that is without equal savant syndrome is a rare but spectacular condition and with somebody with a developmental disability such as autism has some spectacular island of genius that stands in stark contrast overall handicap for years doctors have tried to fathom Kim's spectacular brain I'm just gonna ask you some general questions can I do that yes okay today it's the turn of the world's leading expert on savant syndrome dr. Darrell Trafford when did President Truman removed gentlemen MacArthur from his command April 19 April 11th I'm 51 when at Hong Kong returned from British colonial rule to July 1st 1997 when did Saigon fall to North Vietnam April 29th 1975 when Kim was 9 months old the medical world said he would never walk talk or be able to learn proving experts wrong he is now believed to have the greatest factual memory in the world memorizing 98% of everything he reads I keep thinking that pretty soon the memory full sign has to come up like it does not a computer but it doesn't he continues to absorb and not only absorb but also recall what what day was was Easter this year what was the day it was March 23rd we won't see another one this early again until 21 60 then we won't when is the last time that we 1913 you folk should remember so how many years before the next a hundred and fifty-two years what year will that be the 2160 it's believed Kim's talent may be partly down to the fact that his brain is wired in a completely different way from the rest of us since birth Kim's corpus callosum the white matter that carries vital connections between the left and right halves of the brain has been completely missing but somehow Kim's brain has managed to rewire itself in a unique way this could explain his extraordinary genius what is what is the earliest that Easter has ever fallen 1761 1818 2274 how do you figure those things out Kim how do you do it by looking at my own heart my own mind Kim like most savants doesn't explain how they do it Kim Kim's how do you remember all that stuff I just know that how do you remember all that stuff I just know a lot about it and they don't really explain their methodology and I think in in reality salons are not aware of what that process is  every time I look at him and I when I see it it is and it blows me away [Music]  you  music is everything for ten-year-old Ariel Lonnie a child prodigy from Israel  Arielle is more than just a pianist is a composer too oh this could be an intro and then there could be there before no that's what I want to right now now first of all I want to jot down the intro okay before we start anything you have a subject you got a subject now going to do my opposite of post 9 and it puts 10 so I'm going to work on a 6 or 7 I don't have to do so then I work on the procedure not one of them no custom he'd achievements are beyond far far beyond of any most gifted child that I've known the question was why do you take criticism from your teachers hell from your parents not from your mother I'm not from your father either welcome my teachers are way smarter  parents Gabi and Olga have raised their son in a home dominated by music Ariel was destined to be a pianist right from the off we were negotiating for a piano and when all that was pregnant was a yeah and she said well why why are you so anxious about it what's the big deal is not gonna come back home from the hospital and and start taking piano lessons that I said no but I don't want to bring a child back from the hospital into a home that doesn't have a piano neither Gaby no Olga could play the piano it was for one person only their newborn child when he was born he started listening to music right from the beginning because there was a tape that his father prepared for the occasion and from then on he was listening to music almost 24 hours a day there is a theory that the young children can be taught anything they don't have to be born that way but the earlier you start the education the more you'll be able to achieve it soon became apparent that the theory was working he was less than three just a little lesson 3 and then we were driving in the car and he was sitting in the back and listening to the radio and it was Beethoven's 2nd piano concerto which I recognize but I didn't I don't know the key and I didn't have the CD so I told him this is piano concerto by Beethoven and that he said Ian and I didn't have the answer because I didn't have the city to look at right now he said cannot tell so he says in b-flat major and I look in the mirror and I said are you sure and he said yeah so needless to say as soon as we got home I take out the city and I look at it man it's in b-flat major by five aerial had already told himself to play the piano and started taking lessons by 7:00 he was playing classical concerts with an orchestra of adults  in a way we created it to some degree by exposing him early on and a little baby doesn't have many choices or he just lies on his back and you play bar when you play Barto he listens Ariel is now firmly on the path for a life of music  but although showing a talent way beyond his years he's wary of being labeled I don't like the meaning of child prodigy cuz child prodigy is basically someone who can play fast and not more than that no understanding music just playing fast and how are you different cuz I understand the music I analyze are you a pianist or a musician physician no you genius not yet I will be wonderful not yet  while Ariel developed his gift from an early age others find greatness much later in life but it doesn't always reap rewards [Music] Ben Britt more started out on the path Virginia's in his mid-20s when he began training himself to memorize decks of cards I held the record for memorizing a pack of cards in the quickest possible time 26.2 eight seconds from just a single glance Ben is able to recall every number and every suit in the exact order in which he saw them six of spades Queen of Hearts queen of diamonds eight of Spades Ace of Hearts no ace of diamonds never mind queen of clubs Ben is in treasure clubs in just two days he's going to push himself to the limit and attempt to smash his own world record nine of Spades King of Hearts and three of diamonds Ben's genius is not simply in remembering playing cards but in the elaborate mental process he uses to do it I have an image in my head of a person or an object for each pair of two cards which comes to a total of 2700 for possible images so for example this pack of cards starts with the 7 of Spades King of Spades which is a pack of seeds growing into m2 of Hearts 5 space which is multi pello out of wet wet wet and 5 of Hearts king of clubs which is Alma furred okay making a bration time starts now the key to Ben's memory genius is that he uses a different part of his brain to store new information compared to the rest of us to remember cards most of us would use our working memory but this can only store up to seven new pieces of information such as a phone number this information is only held here for a few seconds before it's forgotten but Ben can link any sequence of numbers and cards with images that he has permanently stored in his long-term memory this system means that in the UK memory world he reigns supreme it's a real community the memory championship people we all get on well we hang out outside competitions we sit around talking it pubs about our systems sounding like a terrible bunch of nerds well be aware of a terrible bunch of nerds let's be honest about this but being a memory giant hasn't translated into financial success two years ago Ben gave up a career in accountancy to focus on his talent now he's struggling I am absolutely completely flat broke at the moment I've got no money at all I've got less than no money I've got loans and things so I am actually quite desperate to get back to work at the moment and I was struggling to find a permanent job in accountancy  people tend to assume I'm a naturally billion person which I deny absolutely I'm a bit of a thick overly in a lot of ways I just have a an interesting hobby possibly because I've got too much time on my hands [Music]  thirteen-year-old art prodigy are kianak Romaric absolutely believes that her god-given talent is behind her extraordinary success today at a local gallery selling prints of her work she has come for a meet and greet with some of her fans yes actually for a couple years since I was 4 to 7 years old I had constantly visions of heaven and I used those visions and I paint them when I'm thinking it you know you're at your age and you're already you know so established in this industry you know I look up to you thank you very inspiration to me thank you she's really been in touch with another dimension that is not common to our normal human experience it's definitely projected she's like a projector from God onto a canvas an artist since the age of four this is no mere hobby for our Kiana her prints alone sell for thousands of dollars at home she is the sole breadwinner with her parents and brothers carrying out specific roles in her business being the main moneymaker in the house is a great responsibility but he actually my pain I just don't feel like I'm making money I'm making them business but it just feels like I'm having fun with the painting but a Kiana's genius has made her family rich since it's slow now and the economy's kind of a little flattened out I probably do where we do I should say we 50 prints a month the print is $1,800 US dollars to 3100 on top of the $100,000 plus a month they make from prints every so often they sell an original well the most originals are between 100,000 and 300,000 our highest once sold is 175 and that was a challenge there was the one with the horse in the middle of the pine trees within the snow and the sold to all of rancher down in Texas we try not to sell the originals you know she has control cuz all of this you see it here is all hers so when she's 18 this is hers I walk out of the picture and I do something else and the fruits Avakian is later a new million dollar family home should be painting in this area here we'll have her probably easel here I know if a easel on this wall or easel on that wall but we asked Lee gave her a little kitchenette where she'd be able to have her daily coffee or tea washer brushes  but is this a normal childhood for a 13 year old girl if a normal childhood is to sit in front of television and just be on set alone for 3-4 hours a day I don't know if that's not much in childhood I consider a normal childhood and being able to serve to serve other people to help other children to enjoy what you're doing to be together with the family yeah I agree on that I got nothing to add to that one she's not missing out a thing [Music]  a self trained genius is about to push himself to the limit I'm going to try to break my world record that speed cards I'm going to try to memorize a single pack of cards in some time faster than twenty six point two eight seconds [Music]  but things aren't going quite to plan for the UK memory champion pushing it too much in the middle I lost track of all the images and has done this before he's very experienced his current record is around 26 seconds and we're very much hoping that he can push it down and give us a whole tremendous shock [Music] Ben gets a second chance [Music]  Ben hopes to have memorized the pack in less than 24 point six eight seconds but to prove it he must now arrange a separate pack of cards in the exact same order  that's my best guess anyway to decide it the two packs must be compared card for card  [Applause]  [Music] I did it yeah twenty four point six eight it was in the end which is just about exactly the kinda time I was hoping for he's broken but you know the four-minute mile for the brain we started out with a puppy teaching a lesson to a mouthy it was holding a microphone over a necklace owned by her machine hammered it was using a pair of tongs to hold a pack of sherbet pouring it into a sieve it's an objective test of how fast he can be done and in that sense it's unbelievable influence of an auctioneer who was selling a tentacle which was growing out of superhero in a suit of armor who was planting a flag in my dad's old garage simple as that in twenty four and a half seconds in Israel it's 9:00 p.m. on a Thursday night and ten-year-old musician Ariel Lonnie has a gig at the tender age of seven he branched out onto the jazz scene [Music]  this gig is supposed to start at 9:30 which you probably won't so it's that closer to 10:00 it'll probably go until about 11:00 11:30 but Adam is gonna get home it'll be midnight that's obviously not a good thing ready for kids please jazz and if you want seven audience he can't get an audience that's 4 p.m. thank you very much don't go Jones this is all them but can a child of 10 handle the strain of such a late night gig  [Music]  like Dave Brubeck is a very very good but a child it's just a little boy it means crazy nights and be strange light [Music]  it's a playoff between what is this what I'm gonna give to the world as he grows up what is we go to sacrifices with fear as the set continues the late night starts to take its toll [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  Ariel decides to persevere  it's now 10:30 p.m. [Music]  how did I play I could do better you know was right  we're going out to improve got a crew he's not pleased  in exactly six weeks our ill makes his European debut at a Jazz Festival in Italy could it be too much too soon  getting the balance right between protecting and encouraging a gifted child is incredibly difficult but in Singapore Valentine Corley is determined that his eight-year-old son Island reaches his full potential the key can be a relatively small molecule circulating in a body fluid whereas the lock is usually a large molecule known as a biological receptor that is often found embedded in a cell membrane the Eynon Cawley's love of science was spotted when he was six years old we discovered that he was interested in chemistry when he was at his aunt's house he found a chemistry book and he was reading it and his aunt saw him eating this and said you seem to understand that and he said I do so she went to and got an exam paper gave it him Oh level example and he answered the questions correctly Aylin told himself chemistry on the internet and at seven past the Oh level exam  now his father is battling to fast-track his academic career he hid he Menuhin without a violin is not a violinist he's it could have been and and the same applies to any of these children if they don't get the opportunities they need then all you've done is wasted their life and wasted their contribution they could have made a society tell me why I can't climb wait in the pressure daddy can't climb because he is so heavy if he steps over here he will ruin his feet because his weight except on a small area will cause a lot of pressure he weighs 100 Lemmon kg and the surface area is roughly how much square inch a square in a square inch can you imagine what would have happened if Leonardo da Vinci had never been apprenticed to an artist none of his work may have happened [Music] to put a child like that in an ordinary school there's a kind of abuse from his perspectives school is in which is how he describes school to me one day he said to me the only the only thing I like about school is my friends so he he does have he does have that but the actual lessons don't give him anything at all nothing I cannot although Island must continue attending primary school Valentine has arranged for him H just eight years old to also study chemistry a degree level it's our only the third year students here get to do the experiments because they have gone through first and second years training before Island he just comes in as if he's gone through the first and second year training although he basically knows what to do if I increase the concentration of nitrogen what will happen very good reaction right to reduce the concentration of nitrogen according to the Kshatriyas principle if I increase the concentration of chlorine what's going to happen yeah cool the room will shift to the right there's a mind of an idio but the intelligence which is roughly the same of ours which is a bit stressful you worry Finn subsequently you need to wash it with sodium chlorite now tell me why we need to do this I'll leave it to you to find out okay why do you need to wash with sodium chloride anybody can tell me now the it's near separation yes it it's layers it's very obvious that he's a prodigy and then I think the people here are very welcoming that I had worried they might not be but no person is nowhere he's tall but it would seem I Ninh might not be the only genius in the family his father now a freelance writer originally studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge when I was a child I had many different gifts but I don't think that they were given full opportunities they needed to be expressed to your minds any of islands ability inherited from his parents yeah I would say so the funny thing is that his scientific interests parallel my own age for age as a child he starts expressing interest in chemistry at 6 it's the same age I became interested in chemistry ok so it's it's the same pattern and yet we can guide him in this pattern we just let him be and he chose the same path it's easy for a child in that position to end up frustrated and having you know known that situation myself I don't want to see him frustrated I want to see him develop it at his own pace in the areas of his interest and become the full human being he's intended [Music]  are you from I'm from Davenport Iowa and what's here you go there if you're a three it's five six three if you're a seven its 309 prodigious savant can peak is a walking encyclopedia having memorized over 12,000 books when did able to become England it's been that way since 827 under AG Burton and Ethel stand defeated the Danes of Brennan Byrne United the country in 933 but suffering from brain damage since birth Kim is a genius in need of 24-hour care and at 82 his father Fran has his own illnesses to contend with having recently had a melanoma removed from his face I have to brush his teeth and everything is physical we shower together and I have to dress him after he dressed himself I have to redress him just just everything we do together and provisions have to be made for when Fran is no longer here the last place I'd want to go was into a group home er into an institution my other son about six months ago came and told me that he would like to take his wife and move into our home where Kim's environment of book says and he would take care of Kim just like I am and we're gonna have four more great days together but for now Fran is constantly at the side of his genius seller the pathologist says everything's great I just can't wear the bandage until next Monday I have to go back and see him again but everything fine no cancer okay yes dad [Music] before becoming the inspiration for Rain Man Kim had been a recluse unable to even make eye contact with another person but Dustin Hoffman told fran to share him with the world ever since he has done exactly that we've flown a million nine hundred ninety two thousand air miles in 19 years we talked to over 4.4 million people in small groups he's become something that he was never supposed to be Kim and Fran are on tour 20 days out of every month today they've been invited to the University of Wisconsin to meet an audience of over 300 people all eager to witness the genius of Kim peek we'll start with a with an easy one what day of the week was March 20th 1979 a Tuesday okay and I was born on March 12th 1933 what Sunday  sometimes people look at savants whether that's a musician or an artist or where memory giant is sort of putting them on display so to speak and you know can you stump the the genius kind of thing and that's not what this is all about it helps them it's a form of therapy if you like a part of that is what we call training the talent and that's really what the treatment of savant syndrome is statistic find the talent and and run with it although Kim is unable to hold a simple conversation he is now interacted with millions of people at events like this all on a non-profit basis what was the best picture in 1961 Westside sorry there's flies when Stein wrote the score in 1957 thank the wind Shakespeare write Rome 1595 but Leonard Bernstein wrote the score in 1957 I'm very familiar with the literature through the last hundred and twenty-five years and there's never been a chem peak and I don't know if there would be another what are you thinking to me that song is called the birch tree [Music]  Vicenza Italy and ten-year-old musician Errol Lonnie has been invited to make his European debut at a prestigious Jazz Festival but he's feeling the pressure so big gig okay so right now what matters is to put a smile on your face and I'm not nervous smile  this is a real Jazz Festival with big names and his playing alongside known people so he's very very nervous we just hope that he will revive before the concert [Music] later that evening an audience of jazz aficionados gathers to watch aerial and jazz Parnas jean-claude Jones you'll know it's better we practiced with the metronome [Music] we're more together we dropped it together some affinity the present re re l jean-claude Jones [Applause]  dad Gabi is in the wings throughout [Music] [Applause]  this time Ariel's a success fantastic I never thought that a little child like him uh could do something like that a genius more than a genius I think I was too surprised how do you say in English but goosebumps I had the goose bump of my yard  [Applause] how's the professional when the Chopra just stops being a child then the question is is he does he have the wherewithal to be a bona fide artist or not and if he doesn't then he can be a very happy amateur it wasn't for music he'll probably have to follow career and something else that it says it will have to be his decision ultimately it will not be ours [Music] you [Music]",

that doesn't work so you can get it for free  you  first thing you're going to do is take every screw out of this microwave that you can find on the outside every microwaves a little different you have to look all the way around it to find every one of them and in this case we have a star slotted screw and I don't have a star wrench so I'm actually going to use my cut-off grinder to cut the heads off that  we've taken the door off by opening it as far as it'll go until it snaps then it comes right off we've taken the screws completely out of back in the bottom all over the thing now the hood part oughta just come right off just like that so let's see what's inside  so now let's look at the guts of the microwave here's where it all happens  right down here you see the capacitor that's a very dangerous thing to mess with I'm going to show you how to short that out but if you've never done this or at least don't know what you're doing don't mess with it it's not worth it and stay away from it but if you know what you're doing you can short it out using a couple screwdrivers  on this microwave you can see the capacitor is hooked to the fan housing which was pretty easy to just pull out of there when I mess around with any of that area around the capacitor I always use something like pair of pliers or in this case I have some wire cutters with insulated grips to it just to help prevent getting shocked  here's your capacitor the way I short these out is I take two screwdrivers in each terminal and I cross them I touch them now sometimes you'll hear a loud pop but in this case it seems to be already safe but I still don't trust it so I'm not going to mess with them I'll keep my hands off of it and set it aside I'll show you where the magnets are the magnetron is in this silver box right here we're going to have to take that off and in this case doesn't look too hard so wherever there's a screw take the screw out it's a nut take a wrench to it now I'm just going to start clipping wires to remove the rest of this stuff to make it easier to get to the magnetron  you  as you can see I've cleared every from the magnetron and if you look over to the side you can see in there the two magnets and that's what we're going to try to get out to take this off you can see there are screws holding it on each side so we're going to take those off and it should just come right down  so what I like to do is put magnetron and vice vice it down really good to where you can get to those magnets now you're going to take the housing off as you can see there are tabs that secure the housing together so what I like to do is to take some channel locks and put them in there and then I just pull like that and I'll do that all the way around the magnetron casing on each side to pull those tabs out  now the next one's a little harder to take out what I like to do is get a screwdriver in here and just start prying until it breaks loose and just kind of go all the way around it there you go this little thing comes out and there you have your other magnet  every microwave is different by manufacturer you'll see where this microwave was pretty simple to take apart some are more complexed but now you kind of know the anatomy of a microwave the larger microwaves have larger magnets smaller ones have smaller magnets  you", "5cFhx_myB0Q": "hello hi everybody gave here from the Hawaii Institute of self-reliance his survival welcome back Mahalo for watching in this video I'm going to show you how to make chocolate from the tree to a chocolate bar on the homestead there's three different varieties that I have right here is a cacao tree this is one variety this is the Aztec ancient Mayan Aztec variety you can tell it's very bumpy and not very domesticated right and this is the Hershey's variety this is what your Hershey's is made out of your standard Hershey's chocolate and this is old-school but this is even older right and how you tell that the pot is ready you can shake it right and there's a rattle you can hear the beans inside and then if it was on the tree and I'm not sure I can scrape the skin right just scrape the skin and there's no green right that's a good indication that it's ready to pick also the development of the ridges and each variety is different you just have to know you're ready so don't go away and learn how to make chocolate here's some pods on the tree leaf the bark to you some smaller ones  is a better example sleep smaller developing cacao pods  here's another variety here we have vanilla and cacao this vanilla vine is growing on the cacao tree here's some vanilla beans yes we grow long vanilla and cacao busted that one up good okay so what we're doing here is I'm breaking them open and he's putting the beans in the cooler to ferment and ferment these for about five days keep it about a hundred and twenty degrees and what you're looking for is just the bean and you don't want any of and grit or any sand or anything or any of that part of it or any of the Rhine so you don't want any of this you don't want any of that and you don't want the seeds to be sprouted  I don't think we have any sprouted ones here so I won't be able to show you what a sprouted seed looks like but it's fairly obvious what a sprouted see looks like and you just don't want any of them in the container  so this is what the sprouted beans look like I actually did find some right there they're sprouted you don't want them in the fermentation container and you don't want any the rhein you don't want any of this all of that goes back on the tree so we're getting everything that you don't want in here out of here and this will ferment for about five days have to help it get hot in this cooler and we're gonna put some of this into that and get the thing ferment and this is still cold and an active right so I can drain this one more time this afternoon before I put this in there and this will be busy man going off pretty good by that time and there's a vinegar with the mother in there you know live vinegar bacteria and probiotic stuff and some yeast and then you'll add that in after we get the juice that we want to drink right now yeah so this is basically yeast to start different vegetation and I'm going to show you that we're gonna collect some of the juice this is very rare  extremely that you would actually get to see cow juice from the beam that's good that's good there you go cacao juice let's test her out oh my goodness it's like drinking a jolly rancher so good oh yeah at the bottom of the cooler where we're gonna put the seeds you want something like this so you can collect the juice from the beans the white part that comes off the beans here are some beans that have been fermenting for about three days now I want to mention this is a dry fermentation they have a nice sweet vinegar smell it's not a dirty sock kind of funky smell it's actually pleasant for a vinegar smell and I want to mention like I said it is a dry fermentation now when you collect the juice the first day or two is good but then you want to add on the second day you want to add some yeast and a little bit of vinegar to start the fermentation process but that's after you drain the juice because the juice is good without being fermented of course you can ferment it and you can make like a cow juice wine which is really good so now what you want to do is you want to ferment these beans for five days total if you go over five days they could get kind of funky of course you don't want any bugs and like I said it's a dry fermentation you drained it every day you mix it twice a day and you want to keep it above a hundred and four degrees and there's a little trick by adding hot water bottles inside here there's a hot water bottle buried in here and that will keep it warm and then these coolers will keep it warm so I'm gonna shut this lid to keep the heat up to keep the fermentation going this has been laying out for about two days it's going to start to dry and the pulp is rotted off you can see that it's kind of rotting hot it's come off of it now these beans took about six days to ferment and then when the temperature started to drop that's when you lay them out to dry and flavor or the smell of the flavor is  a good vinegar kind of snow not so sour socks subtle smell these have been drying and they're not quite done but they're close and they smell pretty good a nice sweet vinegar smell not too bad don't worry about if they stink because roasting then will take out some of the flavor of your beans don't smell so good  [Music]  [Music] in this step we are separating the inside of the beam from the outer shell the outer parchment or chafe let's find one yeah this is easier to crack you see the inside just the nibs this is before roasting and then you roast them after you separate this part from the innard and I'll show you the setup with the Champion Juicer and a fan beans go in the Champion Juicer right in here no screen and come out the bottom the fan is blowing here comes out the bottom right here the fan blows separates  parchment there you go simple easy effective cheap way to do it not that labor-intensive you could set up other rigs and it just takes time to build it and maintain it and you know if you're just a homestead and you're not doing a whole lot of production this works just fine there you go  see just a little bit of smoke starting to rise off of here about time you turn it that's typically down you see it's starting to get it dark dark color to it and you can smell it and the convection oven would work a lot better this is this your typical kitchen oven and you could use a BB a coffee roaster right and then some people will roast the beans whole or roast them as nibs which we're doing right now I believe row seat as nibs better more surface area and I believe you get more of an even roast if you roast the nibs and not roast the beans you make nibs and then you roast the nibs because the nibs are little pieces of being you use a Champion Juicer to make nibs and also you can make the liqueur with the Champion Juicer as you can see them right here I've got the liqueur and then this is the waste that I could add back in and this is the nibs I'm putting in there I started out with five and a half pounds of nibs and one vanilla bean four ounces of cacao butter and about four grams of soy with icing and I kind of heat it up to activate the vanilla bean and to melt the cacao butter so I'm going to show you how I do this it's going to get loud because a juicer is loud  [Music]  so this is the chocolate liqueur putting it in the Melander wet stone grinder this is brand what it looks like this is the point where you add the sugar after I add the liqueur and that infuses the sugar with the liqueur and then you could pour about 12 hours after this has been ready here's the Melander add some sugar you slowly add sugar  to use the sugar with the local for five-and-a-half pounds of a core you put in two and a half pounds of sugar which will make a 70% cacao chocolate bar and then you let this run for 12 hours or if you want really smooth chocolate let it run for a little bit more or you could take your sugar and we're using cane sugar and then grind it in a coffee grinder and it will infuse with the liqueur better and then at that point you want to pour oh I didn't show adding the sugar oh no I did I did okay  what's the temperature  four point eight ninety four point eight so 95 95 okay so it's ready to add the seed and this is one method of tempering chocolate because this has been running and the sugar has been infused and we got some cacao butter he's placing in there and this will start the process of aligning the crystals so we can temper the chocolate you just got to make sure that you stir it up really well you're gonna stir it through the seeds in there completely and that the temperature is 95 you don't want to go any lower and you don't necessarily want to go any higher because if you it drops down below 95 you might have to bring it back up to 105 to break the crystals starting to temper so he's gonna mix this up take out the stone and we're about to pour okay okay I'm not exactly right okay because we do want to go well I'm just saying before you put the seed in before you put the seed in now we've wanted to go along now you're going to drop it but you're gonna mix it and then the crystals are gonna start to align this is my buddy Gary he's the chocolatier yeah we're on right no no no cuz I this is informational and you know I'm just like an apprentice so if you go down to about 93 and that's the time we're gonna start forward 92 okay making sure you get zero water in there you want to stir it up real good with the seed in there you know all that stuff you know the stuff together because this is like the most important part you have to start all over if you mess up the tempering and it is not the easiest it's definitely alchemy there's no true science really necessarily behind this it's kind of interesting  okay I've trimmed some of the bars they're out of the mold trim them with the knife there's just a little excess on the side not a big deal now we're going to do this kind of the old-school way with a piece of tinfoil Willy Wonka [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] there you go bar chocolate we groans we made homestead chocolate that's how we make chocolate now I'm just an apprentice my buddy Gary he's been doing it a lot longer than I and I'm learning from him and there's seven steps to making chocolate roughly and I think that most important or the most difficult would have to be you know the fermenting and the the tempering right because the fermenting you you want to draw out all that that purple and and or as much as possible and the tempering is kind of tricky you want it to be solid right and not flexible but you want to have a break good break here's a here that that's snap that's what you want this is a good tempered chocolate and sometimes it can be hard because it will bloom but bloomie doesn't really necessarily affect the taste too much it's just the look of it and how how well it held the temper so I'm gonna try it oh yeah that's some good stuff there you go chocolate homestead made in Hawaii I'm gonna wrap this video up right here I wanna I'm gonna put a link in the description box where if you want to you could donate and get some chocolate and I'll put a link in the description box for that and I here to answer any of your questions thank you for the like thank you for the subscription make sure your the bell symbol to give notification for when I upload a video and until next time Allu really good stuff oh yes just keep me awake keep you going for a long time this is definitely one of the ultimate survival foods but old chocolate", "A6Dkt7zyImk": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs Reviewer: Tanya Cushman What if I told you that breakfast being the most important meal of the day was wrong? (Laughter) What if I told you it is more important when you eat than what you eat? Perhaps much of the nutritional dogma that we've been raised with is now outdated, like snacking all day long and eating many meals. Over the next few minutes, I plan to discuss with you what I believe to be the most profoundly transformational concept and strategy as it pertains to health and aging. Over the last 20 years, as a nurse practitioner and a functional nutritionist, I've seen tremendous shifts, tremendous shifts in health and wellness: escalating rates of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease - many of which are preventable. The choices we make in terms of nutrition are profoundly impactful on our health, more than most of us realize. During my training as a nurse practitioner many years ago, the dominant nutritional paradigm was exercise more, eat less. I've found this to be profoundly ineffective for most, if not all, of my female patients. The concept of \"calories-in, calories-out\" alone is just not effective. Many of the things that I work with, with my female patients really focus on the connection between our lifestyle choices and how that impacts healthy aging and weight gain. I do not believe, nor do I support, the limiting belief that women have to accept weight gain as a normal function of aging. The National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey, which looks at data with regard to children and adults in terms of their nutrition and escalating obesity rates, compares what went on in the 1970s, where most Americans consumed three meals a day and no snacks; fast forward to today, most of what we are doing as Americans is eating three meals a day and snacking all day long. Really. And so one of the things that starts to happen when healthcare providers are telling our patients that we need to eat all day long - it's wrong. Eating all day long overtaxes our pancreas and our digestive system. It overtaxes it so much that it cannot work properly. And if it cannot work properly, we cannot absorb our food or the nutrients in that food. Another really important distinction when it comes to meal frequency, or how frequently we're eating, is the debate over sugar burners versus fat burners. And when we're talking about that, a sugar burner is someone that consumes lots of carbohydrates and taps into glucose as their primary fuel source, which is incredibly inefficient. If you recognize these individuals: They are frequently hungry. They often get hangry. They have - yes - significant dips in their energy level. They struggle more with fat loss, and they struggle more with their weight because insulin levels are high. Insulin is that fat-storing hormone. So if levels remain high, we have more oxidative stress; we have more inflammation; and we struggle more with weight gain. In sharp contrast to this are fat burners. They tap into fat stores for energy; they have sustained energy; they are much more clear cognitively; they don't get hangry; it's easier for them to lose weight because they tap into those fat stores; they sleep better; and they age more slowly. So meal timing and how frequently we are eating - it's absolutely crucial. Absolutely crucial. Let's talk about some statistics as they pertain to women and healthy aging. So we know two-thirds of women 40-50 years of age are overweight, and more than half are obese. How do we proactively address this statistic without quick fixes? It makes me want to cry when my female patients would prefer I write them a prescription than work on changing their diet, more exercise, other lifestyle changes. Women in their 50s and 60s gain an average of 1.5 pounds per year. Per year. That's average. And some of this is attributable to things like hormonal fluctuations, women having less lean muscle mass than their male counterparts, sleep disturbances and mood disorders. However, there are strategies we can use to help offset this. So folks, I want you to save your money on potions and powders and supplements that are not long-term solutions. I've got a better idea. And I'm going to tell you about it. I've got a better idea. There are lots of strategies that I use with my female patients, but none more powerful than intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting can help fuel fat loss as well as many other benefits that I'll talk more about in a second. But it also can improve interpersonal relationships and self-esteem. And for many women, this permits them - it's the magic bullet that allows them to gain back their former selves. Really powerful. And the really cool thing about intermittent fasting is it's free, it's flexible and it's simple. You take nothing else away. Free. Flexible. Simple. So let's talk about intermittent fasting. It is the absence of food during a prescribed time period. You exist either in a fed or a fasted state. I'm sure for many of you, you had breakfast this morning. So when you eat, insulin is secreted by the pancreas to move sugar into the cells. We store the bulk of our sugar in our liver and our skeletal muscle. But when we exceed those storage sites, we store it as fat. When we're fasted, insulin levels are low and we can tap into fat stores for energy. Free. Flexible. Simple. And so, when we're talking about intermittent fasting, it's fairly simple. If you skip breakfast - If you skip breakfast in the morning, you can reduce your caloric intake by 20 to 40 percent. And the typical time frame that I recommend to my female patients is a 16:8. Sixteen hours a day fasted with an eight-hour feeding window. I know that seems a little overwhelming at first, but I'll give you some strategies for how you go about doing that. So, the 20-40 percent reduction in calories means that you can fuel fat loss. So what are some of the benefits other than fat loss - fat loss and especially visceral fat around our abdomens, around our major organs? We know that it improves mental clarity because insulin levels are low. We know that it spikes human growth hormone, which helps us with lean muscle mass. We know that it induces something called autophagy - I will speak more about this in a second. But this is spring cleaning for the cells. It is only evoked when we are fasted. Autophagy. We know that it lowers insulin levels, blood pressure, improves our cholesterol profile. And we know that it can reduce your risk for developing cancer and Alzheimer's disease, which I like to call type 3 diabetes. If, for no other reason, we want to protect our brains. As wonderful a strategy as this is, it is not for everyone. I'm going to talk briefly about the individuals that want to avoid this strategy. First and foremost, if you are a brittle diabetic, or you have difficult-to-control diabetes; if you are a child, an adolescent or age greater than 70 - might not be the best strategy; if you are pregnant; if you have chronic heart issues, kidney or renal issues - not the best strategy. If you have a history of a disordered relationship with food, whether it is anorexia, bulimia or binge eating - might not be the best strategy because it can invoke those tendencies. And last but not least, if you have a low body mass index, you're frail or you've recently been in the hospital like I was for 13 days. I'm not currently intermittent fasting. Now, everyone always asks, Well, when you're fasting, we know we're not eating food, but you can absolutely consume things like filtered water, plain coffee or tea. They will not break your fast. But when you're ready to eat, what do you eat? Now, I would be remiss if I did not mention that there are foods that are going to be more advantageous for you to consume when you're ready to break your fast. So I want you to focus on real whole foods. That's what your body needs, wants and deserves. So I want you to purchase the best quality protein that your budget permits. Ideally, organic or pastured meat, wild-caught fish. Healthy fats - so crucial - helpful for building healthy hormones and also really important for satiety - making sure our taste buds light up, make us happy. I'm not part of the anti-fat brigade. Really, really important. Twenty years ago, I might have told you not to eat fat, but now we know better. So I want you to focus on things like avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed butter and nuts - really great, healthy fats. Unprocessed carbohydrates. Ladies, absolutely crucial, if you're in perimenopause, the five to seven years before menopause, or you're in menopause, quality and quantity are crucial. So I want you to consume things like low-glycemic berries, green leafy vegetables, squash, quinoa, sweet potatoes as opposed to bread and pasta. Cautionary tale: I want you to limit sugar and alcohol. By that I mean, I want you to not consume those things because they can offset all the good that you're doing. And lastly, keep yourself well hydrated. Now, I want to make sure that I briefly touch on some of the practical implications for how you would go about starting intermittent fasting. Generally, I have my ladies start with 12-13 hours of fasted period. And they can slowly increase by an hour or so every day until they've reached that 16 hour mark. Again, you want to keep yourself really well hydrated. You can also have plain coffee or tea. In addition to that, you want to ensure that you give it a solid 30 days before you determine if it's the right strategy for you. And if you have chronic health conditions, I want to make sure you discuss it with your healthcare provider. Really important. And recognize it may take six to eight weeks to really see the full benefits of what you're doing. The biggest pain point for my female patients is weight gain. I have a fantastic strategy to help with this, but I don't want you to buy into the next $50 container of protein powder or the hottest weight loss supplement that's out there. I want you to think about the fact this is a simple, flexible and free option that you can try at home, discuss with your healthcare provider if necessary. I really feel so passionately about this because it's something that all of us should be discussing with our patients. Thank you. (Applause)", "tx_FIxIE5bc": "but we live in a world where we are constantly exposed to things that are out of our control like pollution secondhand smoke and pesticides Holistic Nutritionist Andrea Donsky is here to help [Applause]  so daily detox is great because what we're saying is you don't have to go and do like a 7 to 14 day cleanse that's right what you can do is do little things every day in your diet to help your body flush out the back and it makes a really big difference because our bodies are a beautiful machine it's constantly look working to clear what it doesn't need yeah sometimes it needs a little extra help for sure so let's help it out yeah so the easiest thing that we could do is start off our date with a glass of water and lemon right so studies show that lemons help to filter out unwanted toxins in our body mm-hmm now many of us might be doing that already but the key is you want to use the whole lemon I've been doing it wrong water and I didn't know I should be using it the skin like using lemon zest so right so that's the key because what the juice itself has citric acid which helps to move our bowels and that's important when we're detoxing because we want to get things out yes the peel has oils essential oils that are good for nausea digestion also they have fiber and we're gonna talk about why that's important in a minute okay so what you can do to get the actual oils up is you can take a lemon zester yeah and then you can literally just zest the peel and you can see the oils are on your skin right it's not amazing and then throw it in your water so you're putting the peel in the water put the peel in the water and are you drinking the peel you can drink it you can eat it yeah totally do it because it has the fiber and then it also if you don't want to eat it on its own you can put a little tea back yeah and then that way it can just absorb it through do you still put the juice in the water too absolutely absolutely you squeeze it right in so you got the juice you got the peel you got it all and it taste so yummy right then oh my god I love lemon water especially warm lemon water first thing in the morning the only thing I would say though does that mean we need to start buying organic lemons or do we need to start washing them better Organic is always great but we want to wash them exactly you want to wash off the bacteria and any wax is it on okay okay a really good point so we've done our lemon water and you say not just first time in thing in the morning but also in the evening before you go to bed yes you can do it before you go to bed as well okay I actually drink it a lot your only day as well yeah and then I drink detox water okay so I'd love you to help me make this sure so what it is is we can use different fruits and different vegetables and put things into it so for example I'm gonna have you throw strawberries in this cream in there throw them on it okay so strawberries have vitamin A and C yeah which helps to neutralize toxins and also flush them out of her body gotta cucumbers are hydrating yeah they're anti-inflammatory right is that what we do because I we do that exactly to get rid of the puffiness okay we've got our lemon zest we've got our lemons for what we just talked about throw it in throw it right in you know what you told ginger those are great for digestion they're high antioxidants so they can scavenge those free radicals shots mint chlorophyll okay take this every day as well that's great so did it in the cute little shot glass that makes me happy exactly okay so mint chlorophyll helps to deodorize our body but it's also high in antioxidants and then you can also put in some activated charcoal so this is really you can open up the capsule and put it on in it makes your hands black and it makes buck the water black so you have to be a little careful this is the hot stuff for all the ingredients now everybody wants charcoal what is it what does it do it acts like a sponge in our body pulling toxins out huh yeah so that's really great so you can mix it all up you want to let it infuse for about 4 to 5 hours or overnight yeah so this has been infusing overnight so I just you can see how that is I would love you to try it because I wear tell me what you think that tastes like I like it I mean I do mint chlorophyll every morning as well and so I like that taste it's fresh right and it gets you to drink your 8 to 10 cups every day right it's easy to get down mm-hmm I think you might feel you know you might have it with me I love it and what's great is you might feel you might have you know better memory boost your digestion might be working better your skin might be clearer so you see all these great positive side effects from cleansing absolutely ok good tips so what is this all about what do we do toxic all right so this is food and when it goes so gently cleansing do you really want to use one and eat food that's high in fiber yes that's because fiber moves through our digestive system removing waste from the body again the key is we want to get it out question if you're constipated this is really great you want to eat fiber mm-hmm so foods that are high in fiber fruits and vegetables you've got your grains like your key line your oats and your wild rice your legumes and your nuts and seeds now women want about 25 grams of fiber a day yes and then about 30 to 38 but we're only getting about half of that really yeah we're not getting even close to what we need okay we need to bump up the fiber right so we can start integrating foods like this into our diets absolutely okay leafy greens yeah so these are there are certain foods that can actually detox specific organs everybody okay so cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts and kale and broccoli they can actually cleanse our liver for up to two weeks after we eat them really two week how much do we need to be eating to get that kind of diesel of servings a day okay I would incorporate and you know what eating it you know a few times a week is really important they're like my favorite vegetables what Brussels sprouts Brussels sprouts kale cauliflower I love them okay I will do the cauliflower and the kale but these guys I don't know my gosh fry them or something that's the key okay a little bit of salt and pepper I'm telling you you like pop them they're so yummy okay all right so then you've got your baby and we've got our basil that helps to detox our blood yes we've got amazing greens like our spinach and our chart as well as ground flax seeds that can help detox our coolin okay and apple cider vinegar has something called acetic acid that help that helps to chelate heavy metals from our body okay except everyone's into a lot of people into that apple cider yeah it's really good really of apple cider vinegar I wasn't really sure what it was about but that's what it's about heavy metals and it also helps to alkalize your body and it's good for digestion too so it's good for so many different reasons you want to be alkaline yeah wanna be alkaline okay is acidic that's wrong now this this is about your skin this is about detoxing our skin and also we're gonna talk about our lymph nodes so this is dry skin brushing have you ever done this before no okay so this is really fun here I'm gonna have you try it okay have you do it with me yeah so our skin is our largest actually honor so our skin is our largest organ and it's also our largest elimination organ okay so when your dry skin brushing so what you want to do is go towards the heart it helps to improve circulation okay it helps to exfoliate our skin it helps to remove toxins and flush it out but it also helps to reduce the appearance of cellulite really it does right so we're going like [Applause]  in the shower before you get obviously before you get in the shower you can do it at night before you go to bed so it's really great at getting things moving yes so you want to look for a brush tip has natural bristles if you feel like your skin is really sensitive you can use an exfoliating gloves as well I can do this in the actual you obviously go towards the heart because that's what's best for our lymph nodes and also circulation that is so interesting I've actually never heard of that okay now you also want a trampoline right so this is a rebounder now this is a really fun way to get things moving specifically our lymphatic system okay so our lymphatic system is what flushes toxins out of our body so I'd love you to step on it yep so all you do is literally jump up and down yeah and it gets things moving because our lymphatic system doesn't have an actual machine I'm pumping machines you jump too high you don't so how long should you be doing this for if you can incorporate this into your into your regular exercise routine or just something you do everyday I would do it every single day it takes as little as 2 minutes to get things start to move and flushed out of your system to do this without smiling but it's really easy to incorporate daily into your lifestyle okay really good who knew it you also get a really good workout by jumping on a trampoline is the exercise alright it gets things moving so important for us", "idRjqi8JC2U": "the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes

spacecraft passed by the hunk of ice and rock revealing that it acts more like a true planet than a dwarf planet the probe found Pluto has a gravity strong enough to hold on to its atmosphere and deflect charged particles from solar wind 23 the gold star collision the year 2013 was a fantastic year for astronomy astronomers also detected the collision of two stars which produced tons and tons of gold weighing many times the mass of our own moon 22 Martian tsunamis scientists have recently released evidence that massive tsunamis may have rocked the Martian landscape a discovery that blew the minds of many in the space community the researchers posit that two meteor strikes caused huge tidal waves which would have produced 165 foot or 50 meter high waves 21 the Godzilla of Earth our

the moon is so volcanically active that a five-inch layer of molten lava covers its surface every 10 years by looking at this rapid rate of eruption scientists have concluded that massive pressure on iOS core causes fractures which head to the surface to release pressure 18 Saturn's massive new ring astronomers have recently discovered a massive new ring around Saturn situated 6 to 18 million miles or 3.7 to 11 point 1 million kilometres from the planet's surface the new ring spins in the opposite direction of the other rings the new ring is so thinly scattered that you couldn't tell if

The world's lightest, that is least dense, solid. This piece has a mass of just 1.22 grams. That is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air, which kind of makes sense because it is 99.8% air. In fact, some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them, they would be less dense than air. I have long been fascinated by aerogel so I actually flew out to Aerogel Technologies in Boston to find out why was aerogel invented. How is it made? Why is it such a good thermal insulator and what is it used for? - Okay, we are going to try an experiment to demonstrate the insulating power of aerogel so over here we have two setups: one with a glass petri dish, and the other one with aerogel on top. - Both are made of silica, but with very different physical structures. We're gonna see how long it takes to melt these chocolate bunnies with a Bunsen burner. - Now to have a look at this experiment, we have a FLIR T1020 which can see temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius. - Looks like it's getting pretty hot. - Yeah, you can see that the glass is getting really hot already. And after just a minute: - It's starting to smoke. - Okay. - It's definitely melting and smoking. Oh, yeah, here we go. I would say that's phase change. - We've got a liquid chocolate situation. We have some smoking bunny. Over here, the bunny is actually sort of melting over, and look, there, it's sort of tilting to the side. - Alright, I think we're going to call that a melt. - What is that? - Oh! On cue, on cue. [Laughs.] - I would say that is material fail. - Not only did the bunny melt quickly, the petri dish cracked under the thermal expansion. - Wanna pop it in? - So now let's try the aerogel. [Music] - So how is aerogel invented back in? - Back in 1931, a guy named Professor Samuel Kistler had a bet with his colleague Charles Learned. - Now the bet revolved around jellies, like peanut-butter-and-jelly jellies. Now the thing about jellies is they are actually a combination of liquids and solids. [Music] I mean, they're mostly liquid, but it's embedded within this 3D solid structure. - So if you think of a gel, like jello, has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that gives it its rigidity, and then that's about 1% of the gel. - So the bet was this: Could you remove the liquid from the jelly? Without affecting the solid structure? I mean, if you just evaporate the liquid out, well, then the solid structure shrinks, because as you remove liquid molecules, they pull on each other, and they pull on the solid structure around them, basically crumpling it from the inside. Now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways. First, he realized you could replace one liquid with another inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly. So you could swap out, say, water, for alcohol. And then, if you take the jelly and put it in a high-pressure vessel called a autoclave, - By heating it to the high-temperature, high-pressure point called the critical point of the liquid, that liquid transformed into a semi-liquid, semi-gas called a supercritical fluid. - At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas. Those molecules are no longer pulling on each other. - So once you've depressurized the vessel, that solid skeleton, that 1% of the mass of the gel, is left behind intact, except for where there was liquid in the pores before is now gas, and that solid skeleton, that nanoporous solid is what we call aerogel. - Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931. It is getting pretty hot as you can see through the thermal camera. But coming up on three minutes, there's still no sign of melted chocolate. So we're gonna pull out a thermocouple and just check the temperature underneath the bunny. Like, underneath the aerogel, and see what, what the flame temperature is. You can kind of see that, that parts of the bunny are getting hot, but it's not the bottom of the bunny, It's all the, around the bunny. - Exactly. That convective heat is moving up and around the aerogel, - So you can see the thing is getting red hot. - And by four minutes, the bunny is looking a little soft. - Still pretty good though, considering how easy it is to melt chocolate. - Can I put my finger here? - Be careful. It's not that it's hot, it's that it's brittle. - Right. - But yeah, totally cool to touch, right? - It is, it is just warm to the touch. - He made aerogels out of all sorts of things. He made them out of eggs. He made them out of rubber, out of nitrocellulose. And, included in there was silica. Actually right here on the table, I have some examples of some silica gels. This is a, a wet silica gel It's kind of rubbery so I can just, you know, carve out a piece. It is 97% alcohol inside of its pores. And then the remaining 3% solid is amorphous silica. Just-- - Can I touch it? - Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of rubbery. Not that strong. - So was I cracking it there or was it already kinda cracked? - Yeah, you just, no-- - Oh whoa, it's very easy to break. Very crumbly. - The next step is to replace the alcohol in the gel with liquid carbon dioxide. - We're about to see liquid CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a. - Liquid CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a has the advantage of being non-flammable, plus it's got a low critical temperature. - Open it up, and-- - Yeah, I see it flooding in there. - Yeah, it's flooding in. There it goes. Just another solvent. [Vibration.] - You can clearly see that it's so much cooler on top. - What temperature is it on the bottom? - We're at 600 right now? - 600 degrees Celsius. - 600 degrees Celsius, that's 1250 Fahrenheit right now. - Notice where the bunny is melting. It's melting right on that edge where the heat's, like, the flame is kind of crawling up and over. - So, yeah, that's - Oh! Bunny down! [Laughs.] - Well, not a bad result. - Not a bad result at all. - I'm interested in in tasting some of this chocolate here. ( - Gross.) - Is it hot? - It's warm. - Warm. - And delicious. - Like fondue. - Mm-hmm. That was great. Once the liquid CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a has filled all the pores of the gel, it's time to take it supercritical. - It was, I would say, a kind of a spiritual experience the first time that I saw a supercritical fluid. - We'll get to that here. - [Laughs.] I love how much you're into these autoclaves. - I love aerogels. To make a supercritical fluid, we can heat this with a hairdryer actually. [Hairdryer blows.] As we approach the critical point, the surface of the liquid becomes kind of blurry. - Weird, huh? - That is like weird waves in there, yeah. I'll speed it up so you can watch the surface disappear altogether. You're now looking at the supercritical fluid of CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a. In this state, the CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a can be vented without affecting the solid structure, and what you're left with is aerogel. \u00e2\u2122\u00ab - If you look at aerogel on a light background, it's almost impossible to see, because it is pretty transparent. But if you look at it on a darker background, then you can see that it has a slight bluish color. And, it's bluish for the same reason that the sky is blue, because all those tiny little nanoscale structures, they scatter the light according to Rayleigh scattering. And, the intensity of light scattered is proportional to 1 over wavelength to the power of 4, which means it scatters shorter wavelengths, like blue, much more than it scatters yellow or red. And, for that reason, aerogel looks opaque in the ultraviolet and transparent in the infrared. - Now, what do you think this would look like if I held it up to the blue sky? What do you think we would see? Would it look ultra blue? No, it looks yellow. And that's because the aerogel is actually scattering out that blue light, and so what passes through and makes it to our eyes is the longer wavelengths like the yellows and oranges. It's basically the same effect as looking at a sunset When you see the yellows and oranges of a sunset, it's because the blue light has already been scattered out by the atmosphere the light had to pass through before it reached your eyes. So effectively looking at aerogel against blue sky is like looking at a portable sunset. The nanoscale pores of the aerogel are also what makes it such a good thermal insulator. ( - Three.) - That's awesome. - Does that look hot? - It's definitely hot. - You might think that because aerogel is largely comprised of air, like 99% air, that it has the same thermal properties as air, but that is not correct. It's actually a better insulator than air is. - That's because the width of the pores is smaller than the distance air molecules travel on average before colliding with something. Their so-called mean free path. Hence, it's really difficult for the hot, fast-moving air molecules below the aerogel to diffuse through it and transfer heat to the top of the aerogel. This is called the Knudsen effect. - It is so weird because you know, you don't expect something that's transparent to block the heat that well, but this really does. - And that's why NASA used aerogel insulation on the Sojourner Rover, Spirit and Opportunity, the Curiosity Rover, and they plan to use it on future missions to Mars. - Why does it need insulation? - The electronics, because they don't want the electronics to get cold during the cold nights on Mars - NASA has also put aerogel to more exotic uses, notably to catch dust from a comet as part of the Stardust mission. - So the particles were traveling about six kilometers per second relative to the aerogel So when they hit the aerogel, because the aerogel's a very low density material, very, very porous material, the particles actually enter the aerogel, and as they travel through the aerogel, they basically break apart the network that makes up the aerogel and they lose energy in the process and eventually come to a stop. This is good for capturing particles, because if a particle like that were to hit a solid surface then it just stops, you know, immediately. - It just vaporizes. - And vaporizes. - So should we expect to see aerogel in our everyday lives anytime soon? - One of my running jokes is when they build skyscrapers in Antarctica, they'll use aerogel as thermal insulation. [Both laugh.] - Why do you say that? - Well, because then they'll really care about how, just how thermal efficient it is because it would be so cold there. - Right. - So instead of having, you know, ten feet of fiberglass insulation, you could have six inches or something of aerogel. - Scientists are currently working on reducing costs and increasing durability. - And that's true. They do have some elasticity. - Okay. - Yeah, so there we go. So it is not hard to break. - They've already made a lot of progress. For example, original silica aerogel is hydrophilic. - There we go. Now this is a hydrophilic aerogel. - So once we've done this, is that piece of aerogel ruined now? - Pretty much. - But there are ways to make it waterproof.

chanced upon a large shipwreck it was the ruins of a Roman trading vessel carrying large amounts of wine and various other treasures from the Greek islands what the diver found was one of the greatest halls of antiquity period artifacts we have ever found but among the pottery marble statues and jewelry inside an unassuming wooden box was an object that historians have never ever seen before a device so bewildering that it altered everything we knew about ancient history this highly corroded bronze relic is the Antikythera mechanism named after where it was found but beyond that it is shrouded in mystery what we do know is that it was constructed by an unknown Greek scientist over 2100 years ago the strange mechanical device is made up of numerous gears switches and mechanical oddities upon its discovery scientists pulled their hair up trying to deduce where it came from who made it how does it work and what does it do scientists from all over the world examined the device for over a hundred years but nobody ever got remotely close to uncovering its secrets and so for the past 100 years the Antikythera mechanism has sat on display at the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens Greece completely undisturbed shrouded in mystery until recently over the past 20 years using a whole array of modern technologies we have been able to crack the code behind this unknown mechanism a whole host of experts in the fields of engineering archaeology and various other Sciences from multiple countries collaborated in an effort to painstakingly pick apart the device but there was a problem being such a significant historic relic the Antikythera mechanism couldn't literally be picked apart so to see beneath the surface scientists had to use a highly specialized x-ray machine which presented another problem one of the only x-ray machines in the world capable of seeing inside this corroded bronze Marvel was located in England the relic itself is far too fragile to be moved outside of its Athens museum so the extremely large and heavy x-ray machine had to be shipped all away to Athens that's a great expense so that the relic could be safely imaged without moving it more than a few metres but the details that they uncovered inside the device blew the minds of every antiquity historian out there because the technology used inside it shouldn't have existed over 2,000 years ago when it was made the complex clock-like device contains 37 gears of varying sizes shapes and teeth counts each cog is precisely manufactured to exacting standards and has a teeth count that correlates to a prime number what you're looking at ladies and gentlemen is the world's very first computer over 2,000 years before the Apple one and over two thousand years before Alan Turing's bomba it's incredible to think that this is an actual computer that can take an input and compute an output that was invented and created in roughly 100 b.c over one and a half thousand years before arguably less complex things like the printing press the light bulb and the steam engine whirring vent so what does the Antikythera mechanism do before I tell you I'd like to take a minute to thank

over a number of years we have been able to determine that this ancient computers function was to track the metonic calendar and predict solar eclipses it also keeps track of the timing of several athletic games such as the ancient Olympics this device should not exist it is so incomprehensibly ahead of its time that it's almost impossible to believe that it was created when it was to put things into perspective the first mechanical clock wasn't invented until late 14th century and it was roughly the size of a small car yet this device created 1,500 years earlier in ancient Greece was considerably smaller more intricate more precisely engineered and many times smarter for it could not only keep track of time but predict the future in the way that's a piece of modern computer software the Antikythera mechanism contains sets of gears pins and rivets that could collectively model and keep track of the movement of the Sun Moon and planets in the night sky this is a diagram of the logic pathways of the Antikythera mechanism showing the functions of each gear if such a device were created today it would still be impressive it is believed that the knowledge used to create such an advanced device was lost in antiquity as nothing anywhere close to as sophisticated as this would be created for another thousand years the gross in probability of its existence has of course led to many science fiction writers claiming it was created by or given tools by aliens but the Antikythera mechanism isn't the first out-of-place historic artifact which has been blamed on aliens in 1912 a Polish book dealer named Wilfred Voynich travelled to Villa Mondragon II in Italy where he discovered and purchased a very old and very mysterious book it had no title upon the cover and no author within it it contained hundreds of pages of detailed yet bizarre illustrations surrounded by text that is written in an unknown language or possibly a code for the remainder of his life avoiding it became completely obsessed with decoding the books words and diagrams to try and understand who wrote it when and where was it written and what does it all mean having dedicated his entire life to unlocking the book secrets Voynich died having come no closer to answering any of these questions the book has been given the name the Voynich manuscript script after the man who found it and so the Voynich manuscript was passed around from one cryptographer to another both American and British codebreakers attempted to decode it during World War one and - with absolutely no success it has come to be one of the most famous unsolved codes in the entire history of cryptography even using the most sophisticated computer Crypt analyst techniques available to us today we have still not even come close to solving it linguists have examined the manuscript and concluded that its contents are not written in any natural historic language that we know of this only leaves two likely alternatives the book is written in a very old language that we are completely unaware of that was lost to time or the other option it is written using a cipher a secret code to disguise the true contents of the text this means that whatever is written in the Voynich manuscript is of such high importance and significance that the author felt it necessary to painstakingly encode every word the animal skin parchments that the manuscript is written on was recently carbon dated the results showed that the book was written sometime between 1404 and 1438 cryptography was really very basic at this time in history the only effective method of cryptography that had been discovered in the 15th century were substitution ciphers in which each letter of the alphabet is simply swapped with another using modern computers we have long been able to crack such ciphers with ease in fact we have been able to crack every known cipher up to the 18th century long after the Voynich manuscript was supposedly written yes this one mysterious book still remains uncrackable the illustrations consist of a variety of herbal plants as well as nude women bathing astrological symbols and visual metaphors some of the illustrations contained within have an uncanny resemblance to images from the natural world that would not have even been seen by humans for another few hundred years after the manuscripts inception such as this illustration that looks remarkably similar to a galaxy and this which has a resemblance of a plant cell yet the telescope and microscope wouldn't be invented until 200 years later there are many aspects to this manuscript that are historically out of place and way ahead of their time leading many to believe that the Voynich manuscript is the memoirs of an alien who was stranded on planet Earth which could also explain the alien like language yes I know it seemed like whenever the Internet is struggling to explain something it turns to aliens other theories from various scholars around the world include the Voynich manuscript was written by medieval scientist Roger Bacon or even by a young Leonardo da Vinci but the carbon dating of the book puts its inception out of both of these men's lifetimes it has been fought by many that's if we could crack the Voynich manuscript we would unlock the secret to eternal youth as many of the illustrations seem to allude to this over say it's in alchemists handbook and it contains hundreds of powerful alchemy recipes long lost but one incredible aspect of the Voynich manuscript which I can't wrap my head around is that upon examination under a microscope there is not a single mistake or error across all 260 plus pages of this mysterious codex there is not one piece of evidence that suggests that a correction was made by the author considering that it contains many thousands of words written in a secret code and some of the most complex detailed and beautiful illustrations from a book of this time period including a masterfully illustrated six page foldouts the fact that not a single mistake was made by the author is quite frankly unbelievable superhuman in fact today it sits securely in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library at yet it is undoubtedly the most mysterious book within the library's vast collection every few years another learning scholar tries to look at deciphering the book stacks and unlocking its secrets or have so far failed thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video then please click here to support me on patreon to help me make more videos

bloodless Wars but Wars nonetheless are slowly waged across many domains of knowledge paper by paper and book by book at stake are the prizes the label of expertise the tenure of Education and the authority that derives from establishment some of these disputes are precise using the scientific method of hypothesis experiment and result to produce concrete conclusions to unhorse old ideas and to move our understanding forward such as that that occurs in the disciplines of biology mathematics or chemistry for example other disciplines are less precise and rely on the interpretation of incomplete sets of evidence that weaving together of data and observation as happens in fields like archaeology or paleontology one battle that's been heating up considerably over the last decade is the fight for the foundations of human history itself I'm not talking about modern history or even what we refer to as ancient history at least as we know it in our textbooks today I'm talking about what happened before this the ground that the tale of our past is built upon and the basis for all of recorded human history and that is the timeline of our evolution as a species our rise from the Stone Age and into the era of civilization it is these older aspects of our past that seem to be in an ever increasing state of dispute the arguments being made are legitimate they are coming from many different vectors and many different disciplines of science many arguments are based on discoveries that have only been made in recent years and collectively they're making the case for a reevaluation of the story of our past ever stronger everyone is aware of this story to a greater or lesser degree and in its most basic form it goes something like this a while ago we humans Homo sapiens evolved emerged directly into the Stone Age fiddling with sticks and rocks and contentedly hunter-gathering our days away it's here that we spend the vast majority of our time on earth tens if not hundreds of thousands of years then all of a sudden we get the bright idea to team up raise some forts build some walls create some gods make some rules and then voila there's civilization the ancient sumerians kick us off then Egypt Babylonia the Greeks the Romans China's great dynasties and all the rest soon we're playing with swords and castles and serfs and slaves now it's time to up our painting game and we have a renaissance someone observes that steam goes up which is still the basis of our entire economy even nuclear power stations are just big kettles for making steam go up we begin a love affair with gunpowder and money we put a meter on electrons and sell them to everyone and the Industrial Revolution begins the inexorable rise of modern technology then all of a sudden hello here we all are intangibly connected to this thing called the internet watching thousands of tiny flashing pixels on some device of unimaginable complexity while sipping a latte wearing sneakers and synthetic clothes and mostly doing so as if this was all perfectly normal the idea that we are all here as the direct result of an unbroken straight line of human progress coming from the Stone Age this is one of the foundations upon which our modern human identity is formed yet it's this very foundational concept that is under siege the evidence that our history is longer and much more complex just continues to stack up the narrative that this new evidence weaves is frankly alarming it tells a tale of unimaginable destruction a tale of the rise and fall of unknown yet undeniably mighty civilizations of advanced technologies that were created used and then lost to us a cycle of death and rebirth on a scale that is beyond anything contained within our current version of history a version that in the light of all this new evidence can simply be considered but the latest revolution of the cosmic hamster of human civilizations let's put some of this new evidence into some context here's a new scientist article from 2006 which was if you're at all like me and in complete denial about getting older shockingly 13 years ago now although you wouldn't know it from the music that I still listen to this article lays out the timeline of human evolution the mainstream story of history as it was taught in 2006 let's make a graph and talk about us kids around a hundred and ninety five thousand years ago we emerge onto the scene and into the Neolithic Stone Age here we stay for many tens of thousands of years until we start eating mushrooms having visionary experiences during cave art burying our dead creating symbolic and abstract concepts also called the great leap forward which was some 50,000 years ago around the same time that humans first colonized Australia then roughly 12,000 years ago and still globally in the Stone Age mind you modern humans finally reached the Americas the Stone Age eventually comes to an end only a scant six thousand years ago from now when the first true civilization that leads directly to us begins with the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia which was mostly in what is now modern-day Iraq now let's look at some of the new evidence since 2006 and how it should be affecting this timeline a new find in morocco made us instantly more than 30 percent older than we first thought pushing the earliest date of our species back to some three hundred thousand years ago new DNA evidence analyzed from Neanderthal remains estimates are split with them from a common ancestor as far back as 800,000 years ago not only that but discoveries of entirely new species of hominids like homo florensis or the Denisovans is proving that our origins as a species are much more complex than we had ever believed as our timeline extends further back it also means that we coexisted with our cousins for a very long time I believe there is much more to find here new archaeological work has smashed our understandings of human timelines in the Americas with digs like their cerruti mastodon site in San Diego although bluefish caves showing that humans were in North America as much as a hundred and thirty thousand years ago and certainly much longer than those dates claimed by the Clovis doctrine of Archaeology that for so long has strangled open-minded research efforts in North America not only this but DNA linkages between Aboriginal Australians and the natives of South America linkages that don't seem to exist in the peoples of Central or North America is challenging the entire northern land bridge theory of the Diaspora of humanity these findings suggests that large populations of people groups large enough to leave genetic indicators crossed the Pacific Ocean long before we were supposedly capable of such feats and when it comes to civilization the story gets even more intriguing with many new finds pushing our supposed start date back further and further we had first thought that civilization arose some 6,000 years ago but the largest megalithic site in the world kablooie Tepe in Turkey is now known to have been deliberately buried some 12,000 years ago likely after thousands of years of use the reed ating of the Great Sphinx in Egypt by professor of geology dr. Robert Schoch indicates that this structure is at least as old as Gobekli Tepe some 12,000 years and it's possibly significantly older a massive man-made pyramid like structure was recently discovered in Indonesia at a site called guna and paddock and it has had carbon dating of organic remains that were pulled from chambers inside the structure that pushes the earliest dates of civilization possibly as far back as 25,000 years ago and it's not just new findings when it comes to the reasons for a revaluation of history there is a whole other category of evidence in this debate and that category is that in many ways our current interpretation of history simply does not make sense when you take a close and careful look at it contradictions and mysteries abound in our story of history they attract the attention of interested and open-minded people despite the efforts of academia in many cases to just declare that no such mysteries exist these contradictions are often hidden in plain sight they're in our textbooks and they're in the astonishing megalithic evidence that is left to us in the ancient places of the world demonstrated nowhere better than those in Egypt just consider the Old Kingdom period which according to Egyptologists arose directly from the primitive Stone Age and whose people did not have the ability to quarry granite why then is the old kingdom so rich in incredible granite structures that have never seen their match since how did they build such massive granite artifacts and architecture without the ability to quarry this stone why are these incredible structures the earliest pyramids ever built and this is to say nothing of the mind-bending precision that is evident in this work when you look closely nor the obvious signs and markings of advanced tools tools that are not found in the archaeological record after the Old Kingdom Egypt kept on building pyramids and they kept on making artwork but they never came close to reaching the same technical ability that they supposedly did in the very earliest part of their civilization ask yourself is this really how civilisations work another contradiction this time South America why are there three distinct styles of architecture present in Peruvian ancient sites three styles that are wildly different in their technological sophistication yet all three styles are attributed to the Inka alone what can we make of the mysterious precision stonework of puma punku and tiwanaku in Bolivia all the cyclopean walls of saqsaywaman why does so many of these sites show evidence of just massive destruction at some distant point in their past why does the megalithic architecture in different places match so closely if it is from different civilizations that were separated by distance and millenia of time why are we only now thanks to deforestation finding literally hundreds of huge geometric shapes as well as the remains of entire cities in the Amazon jungle what about the pyramids that are dotted all over China pyramids that nobody has been allowed to film that alone investigate in some 40 years none of these mysteries fit within our current story of history pyramid culture itself seems to be a constant across many parts of the world the greatest pyramid of them all the Great Pyramid of Giza has yet to give up all of its secrets despite our modern technology every aspect of its construction that we have managed to puzzle out from its precise alignment to true north and to celestial constellations it's sacred geometry ratios that encode the very constants of nature to the fact that it is essentially an accurate scale model of the earth all of these attributes speak to us of an unimaginably advanced understanding of the universe an understanding that must have existed deep within the distant past and an understanding and a capability that we simply cannot attribute to what we no of the ancient Egyptians why are there ancient maps like the piri Reis map or the Iran toe phineas map maps that show Antarctica before it was even discovered these maps were admittedly drawn from even more ancient source maps maps that are now lost to us not only that but they accurately depict the coastline of Antarctica that is under the ice as verified by the US Air Force in 1960 several ancient maps show undeniable proof of advanced technology in their projections and in their high degree of accuracy in both longitude and latitude which was not possible for us to do as a civilization until the turn of the 19th century because of the need for accurate chronometer x' which we hadn't invented until that point i don't think that many of these contradictions nor these mysteries can be resolved from within our current paradigm of history nor can we truly attribute all of the megalithic work or the ancient high-technology objects that are still left to us to what we know of the great the great yet primitive ancient civilizations that make up our orthodox version of history I love and I greatly respect our ancient civilizations but the reality is some of what we see was simply out of their technological reach and this is attested to by so many professionals craftsmen builders and engineers that study these things in detail there is however a key that unlocks these mysteries a solution that makes sense of all of these contradictions and this solution comes to us from adjacent scientific fields and from a series of discoveries only made in the last 20 years it's a huge clangor in the story of history it's something that fractures our established timeline and it destroys the premise of a single unbroken line of human progress since the Stone Age the premise that the story of history is built upon it effectively wipes the slate clean and its impact is such that were we to be honest were we to be truly open-minded and receptive to new evidence we really should be rewriting the entire story of our history from the beginning this key is known to us today as the Younger Dryas Cataclysm and it happened in the period around twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and it changed the surface of the earth evidence now shows that the planet was subject to an unimaginably violent series of cataclysms during this period most likely a series of massive cosmic impacts and air bursts impacts from the broken up fragments of a giant comet that intercepted our planet these events ultimately melted the glaciers they ended the Ice Age they killed off fully half of the megafauna of the Pleistocene up to 80% of all of the large animals in the Americas and they rose sea level some four hundred feet to their current height that they are still at today this was a very very dark period for life on this planet and anything remotely resembling civilization at the time would have been erased almost entirely the most important aspect of this to me the undeniable fact of this event is that all of our recorded history all of our evidence for civilization all of it comes after this world ending Cataclysm why do you think that is  every ancient culture speaks to us of this tumultuous period with their origin stories and their symbolic religions they speak of Cataclysm of destruction of flood and fire they speak of the world being destroyed by a war in the sky and later being renewed they speak of their ancestors living through these events of gods of giants of great civilizer z' with magical high technology like powers that came from across the sea and it's not just Cataclysm but there is another curious commonality between many ancient myths and religions and that is that many of them consistently encode advanced celestial knowledge in their symbolic tales and this case has been made for many different cultures that span the entire globe as well as millennia of time our own religions our own modern-day Sun cults they also encode this celestial knowledge and they also speak to us of Cataclysm of world-ending floods science is now backing up the truth that's encased in these legends and these religions and the evidence for all-mighty destruction during the Younger Dryas is writ large on the earth itself in places like the channeled scablands of Eastern Washington State in recent months we've even found what appears to be one of the craters from this cosmic impact a massive gaping hole under the here with a glacier in Greenland so it is from within this context the context of Cataclysm and near extinction that the human timeline and the mysteries of the story of history can begin to make some sense it becomes a tale of inheritance of extended timelines of civilizations rising and falling a mighty global civilization that existed in the distant past a civilization that was struck down and swallowed by the earth or subsumed by the seas a civilization that left traces of its greatness in architecture and in artifacts it left legacies of its knowledge encoded into the cultures and religions of those people that eventually followed after all the ancient Egyptians even call themselves a legacy civilization a legacy of what or of who it is from within this context the context of a lost ancient high-technology civilization that the contradictions evident in megalithic architecture could be explained and the enigmas of obviously high-technology objects to be fully investigated and solved yet despite of this deluge of new evidence our tenured academics and their textbooks in the field of history are very slow to change if not outright ly hostile towards any new ideas if questioning this dogmatic version of history is heresy then this is the label that I happily accept and I consider this channel to be something of the modern heretics toolkit many others are also on this path authors researchers fellow content creators and I think a slow awakening is actually happening as more and more people realize that it is high time we re-evaluated the story of our past you will find content on my channel that explores many aspects to this debate from cataclysms of the Ice Age looking at new scientific evidence investigations of ancient sites and the search for evidence of ancient high technology my hope is to spread some awareness of this debate to get more people interested in uncovering our real history and above all to get people captivated by the true mystery and wonder that awaits those who wish to visit the astonishing ancient places that are still left to us around the world I want us to heed the warnings that are transmitted from ancient civilizations warnings that are indicated by the astronomical alignment of so many of their structures and written in to so many of their stories we need to understand the dangers that lurk in their cosmic environment of our future as ultimately I believe that our priorities as a species need to change if we hope to survive in the longer term and eventually propagate ourselves into the stars my name is Ben and you're watching Uncharted X I wanted this to be an introduction to my channel and an overview of what I'm trying to do if this is the first time you've seen any of my work then welcome to the channel I hope you find the rest of my content interesting I'm a lifelong student and a fan of history I've been traveling the world investigating and filming at ancient sites and other interesting places for many years now I've had the chance to interview and even travel with many of the experts working in this field and I'd like to think that I have a curious and open mind when it comes to new evidence affecting our vision of the past I'm not championing any specific agenda nor do I claim to have all I definitely don't but I'm open to any idea that brings real evidence as ultimately my goal is to go where the evidence leads no matter how uncomfortable or threatening it is for the mainstream academics working in this field I'm committed to the scientific method and I think that if we apply ourselves with open minds to all possibilities we can make some real sense out of our past I hope you'll join me on this journey I'm committed to pursuing this goal I quit my day job a few years ago to try and do just that and I need some support to make it an ongoing concern I'm extremely grateful to those that find some value in my work and have already seen fit to contribute towards this effort I try to work on a principle called the value for value model if you get some value for this please do consider returning some of that value back to me be it sharing my work tipping me as you might tip a server or perhaps even signing up on the crowdfunding sites patreon or subscribe star all of the details on how to do this are available at Uncharted XCOM slash support please give it a look or please do hit me up on the social medias I will see you all in the next video peace  [Music] you", "MTY1Kje0yLg": "tivity the explanation for gravity is that matter bends space and so you put mass in a place of space at warp space-time and objects are not feeling a force of gravity they're just following the natural curvature and so this is a sheet of lycra where do you get this is my old bike shorts no there's literally a spandex calm you can get a sheet like this if you buy the sales stuff so you don't care what it looks like right for like 20 bucks maybe less depending on the sale and so you put matter and it warps space-time and so if I have another object it also warps space-time they feel that and they're attracted to each other and so that's that's Einstein's picture of gravity objects warp space-time feel that curvature and move accordingly and if you have more mass you have more mass is going to bend space-time more respond and so you put something there now it's attracted now in reality that big mass would feel the warping of space-time by the marble - right it would move a little bit but we usually usually ignore that you know the earth makes the Sun move a little bit but it's so small we can ignore it the moon makes the earth kind of wobble around two point three quarters of the way from the center of the earth we usually don't account for that when we're looking at satellite motion well instead of just letting go of one what if I give it a sideways push now it orbits now it's losing energy which wouldn't happen in the solar system right not noticeably there's some perturbations from other planets and things but this one does lose energy and spirals in if I don't push it as hard it will do the lips when you study the solar system  all the planets are going around the Sun the same way why is that did God decide the only life clockwise or as I'm whether he's above or below the solar system right why is everything going in the same direction well the answer is it wasn't different directions but there was a preferred direction the distant form from had a slight preference one way versus another and things go in the opposite way got eliminated and when it's all said and done everything is going the same way that usually that works 90% of the time and so I had slightly more in one hand and another but I don't consciously do that and you want to give them something spread out a little yeah the wrong way get eliminated right now there also would have been you know this is where this analogy breaks down there's you know another dimension right but those things are out of the plane also that weren't near the preferred plane also got eliminated and so that's kind of cool now my students use a pH et Phet simulation called my solar system and so they've seen all this on the computer and when we do this during our special relativity unit they're like he is just like the computer that's kind of cool that a stretch see the Micra model sings suicide just like it learn to the computer now some things we've discovered using this I'll say it's just some larger marbles my friends with them out but they've been space time too right and so maybe you can get one thing so the earth-moon system maybe and so you see that this seemed you know you can't buy micro this big you get it in rolls and you have to sew it together I've been told to use a stretchy string the stretchy thread to sew it together and so the next time I do it I'll do that because it pulls and so you just a little bit of thread fixes it and so in the morning when I first set this up look at leaning against the table will be underneath fixing holes from last year one time my principal walked in and I hear somebody in the room and I'm underneath on the middle sewing in a little paws yet and then he's looking around for me and he kind of knows some of these in the room buddies oh there you are because what are you doing there and I go I'm repairing a rip in the fabric of space-time you've probably seen plastic ones of these right the Discovery Center Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose has won the Exploratorium has won sometimes they have MIT's shopping malls you put money in it but one thing you can't do with those is put two masses in and so when we went to the moon when we first started we set our spaceship so I'm going to call free return trajectory x' so they would go to the moon and this is hard to get down and they would come back and like a figure eight and so that lets you show now of course the moon is smaller but if you look at the plots of the free return trajectory back from the Apollo program you'll see it has a figure eight sort of shape and so this takes a little bit of practice to be able to do the figure eight these clamps around here you can adjust it to make it tighter if it's not working so Steve and I when we set this up in the morning we played around with it and actually I think it was working better than usually is it's so not easy and so I go through that's one year a kid who read some stuff about the dark energy energy have extra oh and so I'm just energy what does that makes everything come apart right and so dark energy would be that stuff goes apart rather than toward it so if you work in dark energy anytime right and so I go through that spiel maybe it takes me ten fifteen minutes talking with the kids you stuff they're not familiar with and then I just let them play and so that's where we discovered the earth-moon thing is I just let it play and they're like mr. Barth career-low and they're all excited cos they discovered that  so so if you want to try it out what we do but we want to play mr. burns so I see the whole thing if you buy all the parts and everything is about a hundred dollars but one of my favorite days so you're gonna do it Monday right Steve don't do it but just do it once and you'll be hooked it will take a little bit of cooling to put it together but I'll post the plans it takes it comes apart all the PVC pipe wrap it with a bungee cord stuff the biker in that box and I can carry the whole thing myself  this is about the right size you can get your whole class around it pretty much smaller what one problem is reaching some of you I think would have trouble with that so you get a student to do it right one thing you got to watch though is some students will think to go underneath to push up and then while they're underneath somebody decides to put the big mass out and you know they get their space-time warped and so just tell me can't go under  and so is general relativity in the state standards no probably the the crowning achievement of science not in the state standards can you fit it in after the star test you bet you can find some videos like you know I show a thing on gravity waves and then we do this and that's you know a day almost a day but since I don't understand it myself that's plenty so let's go back into the room", "IJhgZBn-LHg": "you  hey Vsauce Michael here do you have a best friend who is there for you 24/7 365 sorry that's not really good enough if you're a friend truly had your back they would be there for you 24 point zero zero zero zero zero zero six seven three sixty five point two four two one eight nine one also George Washington was born on February 22nd 1732 at least that's what we're told however his family Bible says he was born on February 11th 1730 1/2 so which is it mister I cannot tell a lie oh and don't even ask about 1752 in Russia 17:52 looked pretty normal but check out what the British Empire was up to that year nothing really out of the ordinary except ember the second was followed by the 14th were eleven days just deleted where'd they go what happened then it is time to question time and how the earth moves reconciling both of these things has led to some pretty strange things we all love time-lapse videos of the stars moving across the sky but really we are the ones who are tumbling through the universe on a giant wet rock vehicle called earth with a windshield called the sky as viewed from above the North Pole we spin counterclockwise west chases east I always remember this by thinking of the US as a weird Mane headed animal with Texas and Florida legs running forward but we don't just spin we also revolve around the Sun on a plane tilted 23.4 degrees relative to our spin it's kind of nauseating at this scale but from this perspective you can see that the Sun rising and setting is just the earth pointing you towards and then away from the Sun this motion causes your sunrise your noon the moment when the Sun is highest in your sky before your Sun set to more closely investigate this movement let's talk about meridians you are on one at this very moment your meridian is just aligned from where you are right now straight towards the North and South Poles it's a line of longitude as opposed to the horizontal lines that lay flat when north or south is up that we call flat attune or actually latitude the Sun is highest in the sky to you your noon when your Meridian is pointed right at the Sun a cool thing happens at this moment all shadows around you point directly towards one of Earth's poles unless you're on the sub solar point the subsolar point is the point on Earth's surface directly below the Sun it's always somewhere you can check its current location online links as always in the description on the subsolar point shadows fall straight down so they can easily disappear twice a year the subsolar point crosses over Hawaii the only place in the US where it hits land and when it does it is called Lahaina noon meaning cool Sun straight vertical objects look unnatural during this brief time like they don't belong as if they were photoshopped in without regard for reality in Honolulu a sculpture by Isamu Noguchi called sky gate casts a twisted shadow all day every day except during Lahaina noon when its shadow is a perfect circle you may not live in a place where the Sun ever appears directly overhead but once every Earth rotation the subsolar point falls somewhere on your Meridian making it noon for you the technical name for this noon for you is local apparent solar noon the clock on your wrist and the clock on your phone don't tell you your local apparent solar time because long ago we realized that if every meridian had its own time a person just a few kilometers away seeing different shadows than you did would disagree with you on what time it was so town's adopted their own time now later on this trick was standardized and time zones as we know them today came about but that's not all we didn't like about shadow based sundial time to explore deeper we have to begin by asking what's a day I mean obviously it's just the time it takes the earth to turn around once right but according to what everything else in space is moving in some way to the universe doesn't include a convenient sheet of graph paper at Absolute rest we can trace paths on the best we can do on that front is to look at very very far far far away stars so far away like distant features of the landscape out the window of a moving car they barely move as Earth does now to them a Meridian on earth completes a trip around about once every twenty three point nine hours this is called a side aerial day side aerial means pertaining to the Stars even though the sidereal day seems pretty clear it's not what our calendars and clocks are based on because there's a nearer star whose position relative to us has a bigger effect on our lives the Sun looking down on the north pole at Earth's counterclockwise spin the earth also moves counterclockwise around the Sun after a sidereal day the earth has moved a bit along its orbit so some more rotation is required for the same meridian to point back towards the Sun again this longer definition of one rotation is what the modern calendar and clock is based on it is called the solar day but here's the thing exactly how long the earth has to rotate to complete a solar day changes day to day our clocks are just based on the average amount of time this takes so throughout the year they fall ahead and behind the Sun this is a solar graph a picture of the sun's path across the sky every single day if our clocks actually told us local apparent solar time if you took a picture of the sky every day at noon you should get a line of Suns but this is what really happens over the course of a year it will appear as though your clock is running slow and then fast and then slow again and then fast again this problem was known since at least ancient times even if its cause was it in order to reconcile the two the equation of time was constructed in this sense equation means to reconcile the equation of time was applied to what a clock said in order to compute the real time the solar time a sundial would show now some fancy clocks called equation clocks were made that would do this for you but eventually we gave up we gave up and just said no the real time isn't what the Sun says it's what our inventions say now this transition was a big one it was humanity growing up it was like the first time you realize you're stronger than your parents we realized our timepieces were more regular and turned our backs on the timepieces nature had but what causes this disagreement in the first place as it turns out the answer revolves around revolving the way the Earth revolves around the Sun if the Equator faced the Sun all the time and the earth always orbited at the same speed the subsolar point would just stay right there on the equator throughout the year and the amount of extra time spent rotating the earth needed to do to finish a solar day would always be the same but those two things aren't the case first of all the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical so its speed varies throughout the year when it's moving around the Sun faster around the beginning of January the amount of extra turning time needed to complete the solar day is longer than when it's further away from the Sun and moving more slowly there's more because the earth is tilted the subsolar point is dragged throughout the year in a circle around Earth that's not the equator so it changes directly moving northeast then leveling out and going southeast before leveling out and going northeast again during times of the year when the subsolar point is being dragged by Earth's orbit mostly east it gains against Earth's spin faster more time is required for the day to finish now by coincidence we are alive at a time when both of these phenomena lengthen and shorten days at roughly the same time so they add up making September 18th almost a minute shorter than the longest day of the year December 22nd for northern hemisphere Ian's December has the shortest periods of daylight but the whole solar day from sunrise to sunrise is for everyone on earth the longest of the year on December 22nd people in the North just spent most of it in darkness earth's tilt it doesn't just affect how long a day is it also affects how long a year is this is because the Earth's tilt is what causes the seasons for the half of the earth tilted towards the Sun the same amount of solar radiation is spread across less space than it is on the other half so there is more heat energy laid down per area this causes what we call summer and winter for the other half the amount of time from one of these seasonal orientations of the earth to its occurrence again is called a solar year or a tropical year it's a very useful way to define a year because it contains every single season exactly since it's based on the very orientations that caused them but the problem is this the number of solar days that occur in a solar year is not a whole number it's almost 365 but after that many solar days about 1/4 of a day more happens before the solar year starts again this makes designing a calendar more like designing a calendar if your calendar only ever has 365 days in a year over time those dates will drift from the seasonal positions they used to occur during unless hmm this extra quarter of a turn adds up to a full day after four years see March 1st is coming a day too soon now so if we just delay March by adding an extra day at the end of February every four years a leap day we're back on track leap days do not add days to your life you're still going to live the same number of them they just change what we call them but really who cares about being one day earlier every four years I mean one day isn't much you hardly notice it but over time well if America's founders had declared not only independence from Britain but also from leap days and abolished them from happening today 240 years later their calendar would be a full two months ahead of Earth's position putting America's coldest winter days in April and its hottest summer days in October adding a day every four years is what the famous Julian calendar does introduced in 46 BC by Julius Caesar it was the defacto standardized Western calendar for a very long time more than a millennium but it's not perfect look closely leap days actually move the calendar just slightly too far each time because I lied 365 and a quarter solar days don't occur within one solar year the real number is slightly less and fluctuates year-to-year based on long-term changes to earth and the sun's movements which means adding one day every four years is just a teensy weensy too many by 1582 julian calendar dates were ten days behind the seasons compared to where they used to be that's not bad ten days and more than a millennium and a half but the Catholic Church cared because they wanted Easter to occur exactly when it used to centuries ago astronomers at the time realized that if leap days pushed the calendar too far behind the seasons we would just need to celebrate fewer of them to fix the problem specifically we would need three fewer leap days every four centuries the rule they wrote to achieve this stated that every four years would continue to be a leap year except if it was divisible by 100 unless it was also evenly divisible by 400 this removes three every 400 years on October 4th Pope Gregory the 13th introduced this new calendar it took his name the Gregorian calendar he also undid the drift that had occurred since the early days of the Julian and declared on October 4th that tomorrow would be October 15th October 5th to the 14th never happened in 1582 in countries that listened to the Pope it took the rest of the world centuries to hop on board England and its colonies like the soon-to-be United States of America adopted the Gregorian in September of 1750 - by which point their Julian dates were off from the seasons by 11 days hence the disappearing of the 3rd through 13th when adopted the 1st of the year was also moved from March to January first this explains why George Washington's birthday has two answers although more closely hitched to the seasons than the Julian the Gregorian calendar still isn't perfect its difference causes dates to become one day off from the seasons every 3,000 216 years other calendars have been proposed like the one stand-up maths calculated that drifts off even more slowly his video is a great watch by the way but enough of all of this let's sit back and enjoy Earth's movement without trying to divide it up and name it as a caveat keep in mind that Earth's oceans and liquid insides and other celestial bodies are always pulling and tugging and sloshing around minutely changing Earth's movements their effect is measurable but difficult to notice at big scales and also don't look like much in the short term short like the length of a human life looking from above the North Pole the equator spin counterclockwise at about sixteen seventy kilometers per hour relative to the Sun Earth orbits counterclockwise at one hundred and eight thousand kilometers per hour along a path tilted 23.4 degrees to it's spin within our local neighborhood of stars our entire solar system is drifting seventy thousand kilometers per hour roughly in the direction of the bright star Vega in the constellation of Lyra and our solar system is part of a giant galaxy called the Milky Way on a plane tilted about sixty degrees approximately like the windshield of a car looking from above Earth's North Pole our entire solar system races clockwise around the galactic center at about seven hundred and ninety two thousand km/h our whole galaxy is also moving through the universe we know this because when the universe was very young it was so hot electrons and protons jumped around and photons of light scattered constantly they couldn't travel very far before scattering again so the universe was opaque but then around 380,000 years after the Big Bang the universe cooled just enough for electrons and protons to form hydrogen suddenly abruptly photons decoupled from this obstacle course and could travel relatively unencumbered the universe became transparent to light since that moment those early photons have been propagating through space every day ancient photons that last scattered off this opaque fog at the moment of decoupling a light date further from Earth currently is reach us they are part of the cosmic microwave background radiation it is visible in every direction microwave because although they used to be more energetic the universe's expansion has redshifted them now some parts of this radiation are more redshifted than others because of our own movement through the universe controlling for the movements we've already talked about relative to this infinite cooling baby picture of the universe the first and oldest detectable light we are headed riding along in the Milky Way in the direction that the constellations of Leo and Virgo are to us at a speed of 2.1 million kilometers per hour towards a thing we don't fully understand yet simply called the Great Attractor this is how you on Earth's surface are moving through the universe aboard Spaceship Earth okay now stop this is roughly 100 years of Earth's movement through space this path we trace for where we began here is the path you will take through the universe in your lifetime you
