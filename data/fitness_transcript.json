{"9PQW8QVxS-U": "we tried keto here but first the keto diet the hell is it the ketogenic diet is an extremely low carb high fat diet it involves drastically reducing your carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat now this reduction in carbs puts your body in a metabolic state cold when this happens your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy it also helps to transform fat into ketones in the liver which can supply energy for the brain ketogenic diets can cause massive reduction in blood sugar and insulin levels this along with the increased ketones in the body can have numerous health benefits but ketosis also has side effects and we're about to find out exactly what those are because for the next six weeks we'll be doing the standard keto diet which means of our daily calories 75% will be fat 20% protein and only 5% will be carbs which will be about 20 grams a day those 20 grams basically the equivalent of one medium chocolate chip cookie so we're gonna have to be real careful not to go over as keeping our body in ketosis is the goal here we go wish us luck  day one of keto and I am super excited so I'm heading to the store now to make sure I have all the proper foods available for me when I need it I think that's definitely rule number one when anytime you try out like a new eating habit or a diet or anything like that is making sure you are prepared preparation is definitely key so I'm gonna head into the store and load up  [Music] I gotta be honest I had no idea what to expect but I'm having a great time why is it taking us so long to do this I was always a little into you but now I'm all the way sorry about that do you want another drink last night was amazing it's time for round two day 12 of my Kido journey and I finally feel like I'm just starting to get the hang of it a little bit the first two weeks were pretty rough and my biggest problem was probably making sure that I just kept under the designated amount of carbs which for me is about 20 to 30 grams a day and things that I did such as eat nuts for example they have low amounts of carbohydrates but when you're eating it throughout the day trying to get those fats in you don't realize that they very quickly add up so for me up until this point of the journey what's really been instrumental he's using a calorie tracker I got my Fitness Pal on my phone and it's helped out big-time because I can just scan as I go and make sure that I'm trying to hit that number I'm still trying my best to do it I'm still trying to get used to which foods really come in handy in a pinch meats are always really nice of course fats such as butters but a little bit of the side effect of that is I just feel damn greasy it's just I feel like it's coming out my pores almost all the time I'm cooking with it I'm eating with it all the time it's getting our kitchen counters all greasy 'he's getting our tablecloth I've become a greasy guy  [Music]  [Music]  currently working on day 15 and it is something to adjust to for sure you know it's a funny story I actually accidentally basically the dakedo before it was Kido back when I was 19 and I competed in the bodybuilding competition and if you guys are familiar with body but it's usually they'll cut out a huge majority of carbohydrates they'll still have some maybe oatmeal or sweet potatoes things like that but I pretty much cut out everything's I'm like wow they say low carbs I'm gonna you know card so you know basically the more the better in that case or the less the better and I gotta say it worked wonders I got super shredded and I did very well in the competition it was definitely very difficult good thing about that is I've kind of already experimented with something like that and I kind of knew how it was gonna go and how it felt although it's been a long time since then so it's definitely kind of readjusting to that but I feel like I was kind of prepared for this and I knew how my body reacted to it's already kind of knew that it was I was gonna reap some benefits from a diet like keto I've got a wild left though so we'll see that so the results are in and I'm sorry to say it's well it's an it to you yeah it is you know men have a hard time coming to grips with this sort of thing and you know you're in your 30s things are starting to go ya know me it's up it's all job well hey I'll tell you one you give it one more shot well  [Music]  my god [Music] honey it's Aikido  you know it's day 30 and I can tell that I am definitely getting leaner in fact I've gotten some comments from people who know me they say you look like you've slimmed down a little bit and I definitely have it's been about five pounds of weight reduction so far and my eating schedule and habits have actually completely changed over the course of this we did intermittent fasting as a test last month and that's really carried over to this as well because fat of course has twice the calories over twice the calories as protein and carbs so my meals are half the size but I'm getting just as much calorie intake so with the hard workouts in the morning I'm really finding that I'm having just one giant meal after my workout and that's evolved even further into ohm ad which for those of you who may not know omadd's stands for one meal a day so I'm having one massive meal after my workout and surprisingly I'm staying satiated throughout the rest of the day so I'm just loading everything in the morning I'm eating I'm working out and then for the most part I'm good and I'm losing weight so this is very different from me kind of bizarre from what I'm used to but I have to say I'm enjoying it living without carbohydrates is not that easy and when you shop at the store you start to see and notice that almost everything contains carbs I'm not just talking about healthy sources of carbs I'm talking about sugars you would think to yourself well I'm on keto I need some protein I just need some fats I'm just gonna grab something easy like jerky prepackaged jerky and you look at the back of it and it contains 10 plus grams of sugars every serving and you're thinking yourself damn what else has sugars that I don't know about so I think it's really good way of kind of keying in on certain things whether it be processed foods or prepackaged foods and cutting that all out you know after having carbs sometimes you can feel that crash that little ole and almost feel a little Authority can even bloated afterwards so once you cut that out and get used to it you feel better and better we have made it to day 40 of the keto experiments and I think it has been a success so far feeling good getting in a good habit and getting used to having the certain meals that make me feel good and I kind of adjusted my protein intake a little bit higher than a normal keto diet usually it's around 70 or 75 percent fats and the rest protein with a little bit of carbohydrates but I upped my protein about the same content percentage as my fats it makes me feel better I'm more satiated throughout the day and I feel like I have a little bit more energy in the gym and I kind of keep the physique that I have built up and that I kind of want that I see in the mirror and then I'm like okay I'm happy with that because the hard thing about keto is if you stay on it for extended period of time it is definitely a calorie restriction diet you're gonna lose a lot of weight and some of that can be muscle so if you're worried about that I would recommend at least it worked for me to raise the protein a little bit higher I've definitely been drinking more water getting in that good schedule and feeling pretty damn good it's day 45 final verdict a lot of you suggested to do keto for six weeks to give it a little bit more time to feel the full benefits so that's exactly what we've done and I gotta say it's been quite a journey it's been very different for something so simple as cutting out carbohydrates it changes a lot of the ways you think about things I know for me I've been able to experiment with a lot of new recipes that have been really enjoyable keto cakes keto pizza and it's been very interesting and enlightening but as far as the flex or no flex this is a really tough one because there's some things I really enjoy and there's some things I don't enjoy enough so I'm gonna have to go with no flex because even though I would like to remain low-carb and as Brandon said try to keep sugar as absolutely low as possible which I thank keto for helping me to do that I do love carbohydrates I love blackberries I love apricots and it's been really tough to try to keep it under that 20 to 30 grams a day so I will stay low-carb I'll try to stay zero sugar but keto in its most hardcore form I'm not gonna continue to here too but thank you keto it's been fun but we got a part wait the final verdict for me personally cuts out any kind of sugars it is definitely difficult to get used to but I feel like it definitely has the benefits you can slightly adjust it to obviously what you feel like it fits your personal schedule and your eating habits but I like meat I like fat and it's something easy to fit into my schedule and I feel like it does my body pretty damn good looking good feeling good and I feel like it was a success so I am revisiting my initial review of the keto diets originally I did a flex and for a good reason because I felt it worked pretty good within my schedule it made me feel good it made me look better but as I progressed I just realized it's not really that sustainable to have that lower carbohydrates all the time because there is a lot of healthy sources of carbohydrates and I'm kind of adjusting now to a lower carbohydrate diet but keeping healthy sources in there of course keeping all my vegetables but also introducing some complex carbohydrates like potatoes or sweet potatoes oatmeal things of that nature probably sticking with around 80 grams or so they maybe even up to 100 depending on the day and I am definitely feeling a lot better having those introducing those into my regular eating plan and workouts are feeling better feeling stronger and so I I think that I still stand by the original flags but I did want to kind of revisit a little bit and just say that it might be tough to sustain something like that for longer periods and it might be important to adjust accordingly to how you feel how you react to it and for me definitely staying over carbohydrate but introducing those healthy sources well that wraps up the episode hope you enjoyed it what other recommendations do you guys have let us know in the flow bar above we're willing to try almost anything almost we're this close yeah as soon as you start going down we'll try it yeah that's young we're gonna get desperate hopefully that's not going to be for a while yeah stable", "s4dbHLOnTmU": "on one hand we've got so-called fitness experts overcomplicating chest training and making it seem like it's far more complex than it really is on the other hand however more and more minimalist trainers have gone the other route claiming that building a bigger chest is as simple as bench pressing frequently and getting progressively stronger the truth however lies somewhere in the middle sure there are those genetically gifted individuals whose chest would grow from nothing more than a few push-ups each night before bed but they're the exception you see building a solid well-rounded chest doesn't have to be this elaborate process where you hit the chest from all different angles likewise it's usually not as simple as bench pressing everyday if you want to build bigger pecs there are two things that have to happen for starters you've got to understand the anatomy and physiology of the chest once you understand what muscles are involved and more importantly what function they're responsible for choosing the right exercises and how to perform them more effectively becomes obvious second once you've got your two to three key movements focus on progression if you're performing the right exercises using proper form this ensures that the pecs are doing the majority of the work rather than the secondary muscles bearing the load and gradually increasing the load for example increasing reps without sacrificing weight or increasing weight without sacrificing reps your chest will grow in this video I want to briefly go over the basic anatomy of the chest and its functions and then I want to go over what are in my opinion the only three chest exercises you need for building well-rounded pecs the anatomy of the chest contrary to popular belief the chest is actually only made up of one main muscle the pectoralis major the chest muscles main function is to bring the upper arm across the body as you can see here the pectoralis major has multiple heads there's a sternal costal head which attaches the breastbone in rib cage - your upper arm and a clavicular head which attaches your collarbone to your upper arm this is important because how a muscle attaches to the skeleton helps determine how it responds to different movements for example exercises like the flat barbell bench press emphasizes the larger sterner costal head of the pecs and the exercises that involve shoulder flexion for example moving the arms up and away from the chest like the incline barbell press emphasize the clavicular head or upper chest that said it's not hard to see why targeting the quote-unquote mid chest or quote-unquote lower pecs is a complete waste of time the pectoralis major is one muscle responsible for the same few functions horizontal adduction internal rotation and shoulder flexion and extension now that you understand what muscles you're targeting and what movement they're involved in it's time to go over the best exercises for training these functions effectively number one a primary pushing movement the focal point of your chest training should do a few things first this exercise should focus on the primary function of the pecs horizontal adduction second this should be a big heavy compound exercise that allows you to load the pecs and lastly rather than focusing on one portion of the pecs it should target the chest as a whole that said the benchpress is the obvious choice a study published in the Journal of interventional medicine Applied Science found that benching 3 days per week Monday Wednesday and Friday with no chest isolation exercises increase both chest thickness and 1 rep max by 50% on average the chest gains the subjects experience were directly associated with a stronger benchpress now I know what you're thinking you're already bench pressing getting stronger but your chest isn't responding am i right this is where understanding the physiology comes into play here's what I want you to do put your left hand over your right PEC bend your elbow at 90 degrees and now bring your arm up so your shoulder and elbow are in line from here I want you to push your arm out in front of you almost as if your bench pressing while keeping your hand on your chest did you notice the lack of tension in your chest that's because benching with flared elbows almost completely eliminates the main focus of the PEC major horizontal adduction now try this put your left hand over your chest bend your elbow at 90 degrees but this time instead of bringing your arm up to the point your shoulder and elbow on line stop Midway with your elbow closer to your body from here with your hand still on your chest push your arm out as if your bench pressing did you notice the huge difference this simple change in how you perform the bench press alone will make a huge difference in the development of your pecs not sure if you're tucking your elbows too much or too little first make sure your wrists and elbows are in line when gripping the bar second bring the bar down right below the nipple line if you can accomplish those two things you're likely keeping your elbows in a safe position while also putting more tension on the pecs than the shoulders if you're already bench pressing frequently using proper form and getting stronger fear not there are still two more movements you should be implementing number two the clavicular head although the bench press does a great job at distributing tension among the entire chest the research is clear that the incline bench press activates the upper chest better than the flat bench this is why I recommend that everyone include an exercise that prioritizes shoulder flexion when pushing to ensure stimulating the upper chest sufficiently this exercise should focus primarily on the upper chest and include a good deal of horizontal adduction getting the humerus across the body for most I'd recommend an incline dumbbell press using dumbbells will allow more freedom to bring the humerus across the body horizontal adduction while still allowing you to load the upper chest to a great degree another alternative would be the close grip bench press although this exercise is tooted as a great triceps builder and it very well is research shows that the close grip bench press activates the upper chest 20 to 30 percent better than the flat barbell bench press and number three deep stretch short contraction last but certainly not least I recommend performing an exercise that targets the chest as a whole allows for a nice stretch and allows for the greatest feel of the muscle in my opinion there's no better way to end a chest workout than a chest fly whether it's done with cables or dumbbells the amount of stretch you can achieve safely through the chest fly is second to none not to mention the further we get the upper arm across the body the shorter we can get the PEC want to maximize your contraction with the chest fly don't make this mistake most people will perform the chest fly with their elbows slightly bent almost as if they're hugging a barrel the problem is this is causing us to stop short of a short and contraction making the chest fly almost completely useless instead start the movement off with your elbows slightly bent but begin to straighten your arms out as you complete the rep this will allow you to get the humerus further across the body making for a fully short and contraction to summarize make the bench press the focal point of your chest training load the bar up and aim to get as strong as possible include some upper chest work to ensure you're providing enough volume for growth then finish off your workout with a fly that allows for a good stretch strong contraction and an insane pump want to take your chest training to the next level

Keep that shit in the front of your mind and when shit goes bad and it goes sideways a lot of shit Does you're getting booed out the fucking building or coming through this injury or people? Are you writing you off? Are you guys gonna fucking make it you know any of that shit? You got it. You got to keep it in here The and it really has to It should Drive you This idea and this notion that you could be anything you want you can accomplish anything you want, right? We hear that you've heard that from the time we were little boys You hear that now, you're already incredibly accomplished You can win an NBA championship MVP of the league you could become president You could become governor you can have you could be in in in in You could be an entertainment you could do Charles and you do Shaq you lose that you could do whatever you want to do. You guys know that? The thing that has worked for me is to remember The hard times so And I'm sure you guys all have your processes. And again, I'm going to tell you what to work for me. So before A big movie comes out before back in the days when I was wrestling with WWE a Wrestlemania match Anything big that would happen. I would always take a moment and I just remind myself All right. I was evicted when I was 14. We were kicked off the island. We couldn't live in Hawaii and no place to live a Lot of shit happened then when I moved to Nashville I was arrested multiple times by the time I was 16 years old. I got remember that if I were playing on this team Which might you know? my skills are what's that term all the shit's so I never played but before I lace up before I get on court before I playing these big games before I go to the Staples Center Where history says those are those are historic will Hall Sahara at the Staples Center I would remember that and it allows me then to be present in the moment and understand. Holy shit. That's the stuff I have around me right now. This is this shit that I dreamed of when I was a kid I am here. I played for University of Miami played great teams Warren Sapp where Lewis there were my teammates. They were ballin Warren Sapp was playing tight end that time. I was starting defensive tackle. They moved him over to d-line And he looked at me. He's like yo, do I'm gonna take your spot. I said, you ain't taking my fuckin spot He's I'm gonna take your spot We battled and he took my spot They can imagine how that fuck with me cuz there goes my opportunity He went in switch to defensive tackle lit the world on fire Well what that did it crushed me to crush my dreams. I had a piss-poor senior year zero production No NFL no combine invite Nothing finally went to the CFL Calgary Stampeders making $250 a week Canadian Canadian I had to send that shit home To my to my wife at that time I had no money so I remember that I got cut from Canada. I had 7 bucks in my pocket And I always tell that story. So now my production company 7 bucks advertising agency 7 bucks. Everything is 7 bucks I always remember that what helps me is to keep the hard times in the front of my mind Because it allows me to go into these big Moments that I've worked my ass off and you guys have worked your ass off It allows me to go into these big moments with a different perspective What it also does for me and again this just this is what works for me like I Keep my back excuse my language. My back is up against this motherfucker Every day it's against this fucking wall. Excuse my language But it's a begins this motherfucker because it's what I believe in and when my back is against this motherfucker then there's nowhere to go But that way that's it So I feel like this could be something an ideology mindset that could help you Could if you look at it that way Because you made it already we made it We're successful boys and we're lucky boys to be we're at oh you guys made it everybody in the room Nobody's gonna get evicted anymore Anything you got there's no more money problems, right? You got a lot of hands out now I get a little bit Can I get a little bit right that happens? But when you make it For me I need this I need this So every day my back is up against this motherfucker and this is how I operate Now doesn't mean don't smile. There's me to laugh and joke Right happy I'm happy. I'm a happy guy But when it comes to business and when it comes to executing what's up against this? And I gotta go that way And I don't give a fuck who is in front of me. They're not gonna stop me. I feel like for me it feels seamless Because you prepared for so long, but it's just like you guys prepping for a game. That's the fun part That's where it's like fuck is fun and people are paying their hard-earned dollars to come see you. They're cheering. They're going bananas They're booing the shit out of you or on the road. It's that's fun. That's what you live for I mean, that's the juice right there The prep is where the characters made and I just don't mean the character I play I mean the fucking the character in here So for me the prep is getting with the director getting with the producers getting with the writers getting with the getting with so in essence it's like getting with all your coaches and your different position coaches and and all the Meetings that you have to have right? So that's the work you put in the key for me was Where does it start? What's the anchor? What's the anchor so I could have all these ambitions and you guys have all these ambitions, which is great It's important. I'll play this role. You'll play that role. I'll execute this thing and it'll come out this summer you guys will execute this thing during the summer right what it's time to really put in a lot more work But the key with me is just always finding what the anchor is and the fuck and anchor is Getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning everyday before anybody else and Grounding. My thought process is in the no one will outwork me No one I love and I respect you guys Motherfuckers one that worked me I'll start with this Two hands putting it'll work. The anchor for me has always been the work in terms of the weight room training So when I first started wrestling I was six years old rolling on the mats with my dad my old man. A lot of you guys will know this Yeah, Rocky Johnson My old man was Rocky Johnson was the first black WWF tag WWWF at that time first black WWE tag team champions were Tony Atlas back in 1983 My uncle's were wild Samoans. I come from a long line of pro wrestlers but before the wrestling part happened I was just in the gym putting in the work at six years old rolling around on the mats and finally when I could touch Weights at 13. That's what I was doing But the weight part for me and the gym part Has has always been has to be the anchor look at the end of the day like again That's it's the kind of stuff that I talked about at top is I have to hold on to My dad in his pickup truck came down four o'clock in the morning Pick me up at in whoo in Miami from Tampa. We lived in a little shitty apartment in Tampa He drove down in his little pickup truck to Miami to get me when I was cut from the CFL. I was driving up I 75 I don't know if you guys are from Florida any of you guys if you know It's I 75 is like especially down in Florida, Alligator Alley I'll never forget it's four o'clock in the morning, and I thought well fuck that. I leave home like you guys left home I'm ready to tackle the world to get after it achieve my dreams and goals fucking crushed by 22 23 years old I'm now I got to move back in with my mom and dad. I played on great teams. Oh, wait a second This is not supposed to be my future. I'm supposed to be in the NFL right now I'm supposed to be making a lot of coin and behind my parents shit buying me shit taking care of my wife But it never happened. So I pulled in my wallet. I thought well, let me see how much money I have I opened it up. I had a 5 a 1 and change I'm not fucking around and I Rounded up to 7 bucks But I thought God ain't this a bitch. I got 7 bucks in my pocket. Where the fuck do I go now? What'd I do? I can't go back to CFL coz I are you know? The point comes where you hear that voice big runs over like you're done, right? So I heard that voice so as coach was saying man. I hold on to that shit. I'm telling you I keep my back as Perkins's motherfucker. We laugh we joke, we have a good time Press is always fun to do sometime. You got to make it fun That's another thing he had to do your best to make press fun Who as you can but my back is still up against this motherfucker I do not forget it what this also helps me do and again it works for me is At some point you got to be fucking tired of not being number one You have to be and you got a fucking plate angry and I play angry now I'm cool and calm with my approach and when I step out on my field, which is a set or you know like There's something you're always gonna have haters and haters like well Yeah, man, how many movies you're gonna make her how much shit are you gonna do like you do a lot of shit? I say yes Cuz my ambition of course why not I could do it Yeah, I love what I do and not only that but in what world do we not work every day? It doesn't mean it's just like you guys in the off season. You got work every fucking day Doesn't end my back is up against this thing, you know, and I and I and I started to play Angry, by the way, and and I still I still play angry my last match Brock lesner Transition and I realized if I had to be great at something I wanted to be great in this world of Hollywood and movie making and producing and entertainment I had to commit and like you guys have to commit obviously you commit to something commit to the goal So I quietly retired two years later. I thought what the fuck did I do in my career? Cuz my movies were not doing well I was written off I was like around 2006 2007 I was like goddamn. I left I pulled a Jim Brown I left when I was on top like number one in the wrestling business and I left it was a ballsy gutsy So I'm called it stupid move, but I had to commit and I had to follow it wasn't my god And at that time I'll share this with you guys and Will Smith is my boy And I sat down at that time with the agency I was with and I said, what do you want to accomplish? I said I want to accomplish the world. I want the world and I want I want Will Smith's career But and I said and I mean this respectfully because I know he's here at this age. See with us I want to do it bigger and better? and They looked at me like I had three fucking heads and they were like. Mm-hmm. Okay but I still stayed focused and I still had these still put in the hard work with my two hands and That's it. And that's what it comes down to with you guys. One of the keys is Remember where you came from? Keep that shit in the front of your mind and when shit goes bad It goes sideways a lot of shit Does you're getting booed out the fucking building or coming through this injury or people? Are you writing you off? Are you guys gonna fucking make it you know any of that shit? You got it. You got to keep it in here And it really has to It should drive you", "vuIlsN32WaE": "[Music]  right well I might get myself into a position here and on the red carpet I don't think I need to introduce myself do I but this is the last talk for the day we will have a little bit of wrap up after this and we will have a little time to to reflect and maybe some questions I know some of you will want to get home but let's get cracking because we've got about well probably 12 minutes is my talk maybe might go for 15 so don't panic if that thing goes over so here we go the mathematics of weight loss well let me start with this last year I went surfing in Fiji and the resort had a photographer following us around taking all these photos which was really great except that I couldn't help but notice this somehow I'd managed to become 5 kilograms overweight couldn't believe my eyes so I did what they tell you to do I ate less and I moved more and within just three months I discovered I'd lost 6 kilograms so then I did what a normal person does I did physics but anyone would do this I graphed my weight and when I did the linear regression I discovered that lo and behold on average I'd been losing 85 grams a day which got me thinking in fact it got me very curious about this question that I've since discovered most people have no clue about in fact they've never even thought about this and to prove my point I've made a little video on Bondi Beach and the question was this when somebody loses weight where does it go what does it become how does it get out of your body you're probably dumbstruck by the question these people were so listen to this where does it go where does the weight go  well well I don't know I don't know that I don't know the mysteries of science it gets used up the universe another dimension doesn't go anywhere it comes over to me becomes nothing don't exist anymore I guess that's a very good question question what it fascinating question what would you say it goes right in the crapper mate sweat moisture and sweat evaporates up a Bondi Beach that's where I go well basically you burn it up as energy darkness is energy heat energy burnt in energy yeah you got me there I'm not quite sure mmm so what the heck is going on we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic I don't need to tell you about it so why don't these people know the answer to this fundamental question because not one of them was right and we do know the answer this is not groundbreaking stuff I'm about to tell you so let me just remind you of a few things you do know what's the chemical formula for water h2o chemical formula for carbon dioxide you all know it right so you know what human fat is made of so what is the chemical formula for human fat there is such a thing believe it or not it's been known since the 60s it's C 55 H 104 oh six that's the chemical formula for the average fat molecule in a human body some of the molecules might have a few more carbon atoms and a few more hydrogen some might have less they all have just six oxygen atoms that's very important and helpful for later but this is the average fat molecule hate c55 hate 104 oh six so let's be very clear about this the difference between that and that is C 55 H 1 Oh 406 I kid you not the difference between that and that same thing c55 h1 Oh 406 so how does this stuff get out of a human body well here's the general equation looks pretty sort of interesting slightly complicated not if you've done some year 10 chemistry surely this is year 10 chemistry although well it's not really but here's what it says fat plus oxygen gives you carbon dioxide and water that's what it becomes and this biochemist have known this for ages you inhale that you exhale that that's what happens to it amazing now that little arrow there is kind of oversimplifying something called biochemistry that's three years at university and my apologies to the biochemist so that men doubt oversimplify but I'm trying to get to the crunch it's really complicated it doesn't just come out of you for no reason you've got to do stuff eat less move more what we'll come to that in a minute but look when you want to lose weight you want to lose kilograms that's all kilograms all that stuff there so what do people say heat it burns up as energy because that's what we've been telling them all this time and it's very confusing because energy has different units kilojoules or you might use calories and yes that's heat that's motion when you move or it's thinking your brain needs energy or it's growing but that's not where the fat goes so what are we talking about here well let me just show you a couple more things so I've got some carbon dioxide here in its frozen form we call it dry ice it's carbon dioxide it has mass thing is you're not used to seeing it but here's some dry ice and it's heavy and if you put it in water lo and behold it does this cool thing in bubbles like you've all seen that before well that's carbon dioxide in water that's what fat is kind of made out of but it's not fat I'm not making fat that is not fat so how does that become fat well it doesn't just like that it becomes sugar first plants make fat well they start the whole thing a plant takes six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water uses an amazing chemical called chlorophyll holds them together and then sunlight comes in and finds those molecules together and it becomes sugar c6h12o6 is glucose fructose same formula c6h12o6 sucrose is glucose plus fructose stuck together - and h2o molecule so it's do the maths c20 no 12h 2205 right well here some this is sucrose plants make it and it's this stuff joined together it's now got chemical energy holding these molecules together so they don't just fly around like that and by the way if you drink that 600 mil of lemon flavored soft drink you'll get 17 teaspoons of this stuff are in there I'll just quickly show what that looks like here's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 right so if you drink that it's the equivalent of doing what I just did with the spoon except munching it all down exactly the same no difference so if you do do that then what happens well let me explain something else that I've been telling kids for a little while and they get this so when you eat food it's not in your body straight away if you swallow that sugar it's not in you yet so here's a pool noodle right it's got a hole running through it and here's an almond and if we put the almond in there can go all the way through and out the other end whoop-dee-doo here's another almond if I put an almond in here is where's the almond you would say the almonds in the pool noodle okay but is it in the foam that the pool noodle is made of no of course not it's just in the hole that runs through it that's food you swallow food it's not in you it's in the hole that runs from here to the back door and getting food into you it's called digestion so with this stuff you've got to break the bond that's holding the fructose to the glucose and as soon as you do that then that stuff can cross the barrier or internal skin and into your body and then it can go around in your blood that's digestion but now it's not metabolism yet it's got to go into your cells and then you've got to burn it up and if you don't burn it up if you eat all that sugar after you've had your three meals in the day your body doesn't waste it doesn't come out here the stuff that comes out the back door was never in you apart from a few molecules of cholesterol it's just fiber that you couldn't digest plus the bacteria that live in your gut you lose about 500 billion of those in one single sitting they're tiny that's many times the population of the earth every time you flush the toilet it's amazing but that stuff was never really in you so here's what happens if you don't then metabolize that sugar well then it's going to get converted into the stuff that we all have a problem with fat now better just prove that you do breathe breathe this stuff out right if you metabolize sugar you turn it back into carbon dioxide and water so every time you exhale out comes a bit of carbon dioxide you can't see it this is the problem this is why people don't know how you lose weight so there you go of traps and breath I've inhaled that 5% of the air in there is now carbon dioxide because it's come out of my lungs I've got some liquid nitrogen here and I'm going to use that to freeze this air liquid nitrogen is minus 196 very handy um where did I write that in fact I'll just pour it straight on so be a little bit careful with this stuff I use it all the time if I look a little blase I don't mean to it's please respect this stuff if you play with it the way you would respect boiling hot water now if you pour it onto a balloon the balloon does not pop which is incredible the nitrogen is minus 196 oxygen turns into a liquid at minus 183 so the oxygen in the balloon is turning into liquid carbon dioxide turns solid I've got a big bowl of it there but it turns solid at minus 78 so in the balloon now I have frozen well I have liquefied oxygen and frozen carbon dioxide I'm gonna take it out you'll see them so I'll just take a while for the balloon to go a little bit clear at the top the nitrogen in here air is 79% nitrogen the nitrogen is in the top of the balloon but now look at that liquid down there can you see that that's the oxygen from my breath that I hadn't used but once it's all gone there'll be some white powder left right the white powder is breakfast that's the carbon dioxide the carbon atoms I ate in the last 24 hours and when I blow on them they get warm enough to turn back into gas and they vanish and people think there's nothing in the balloon the balloon has mass those atoms have mass you can see carbon dioxide has mass when you solidified but when you breathe it out you don't see it and we've been confusing people by talking about kilojoules or calories and they're really important but people do not seem to understand that when you lose weight you're losing atoms you can't just turn atoms into nothing in fact science teachers out there you need to change the way you teach chemistry because those people and many in this room think that you can turn atoms into energy well it's one of the founding principles of modern chemistry you cannot turn an atom into pure energy it's called the conservation of mass before a reaction and after a reaction we teach kids you've got to have the same number of atoms it's called stoichiometry well we haven't been teaching it very well at all because people think you can turn fat which is kilograms into nothing or just kilojoules can't do it so he was my big fat question I'm a physicist I knew that bit but my question was if I've got 10 kilograms of this stuff then how much carbon dioxide does that become and how much water and turns out that that's really simple - this is year 10 chemistry and year 10 maths you need the periodic table of elements you have to look up hydrogen carbon and oxygen there they are now the periodic table has some important information on it the weight of a single atom of these elements so the weight of a single atom of carbon is twelve point zero zero one zero one one atomic mass units doesn't matter what they are in kilograms just yet I'll show you why in a minute we've got 55 of those in a average fat molecule so there's six hundred sixty point five nine what about the hydrogen okay there's a hundred and four of those so we have in one molecule of fat 104 point eight three atomic mass units okay great the oxygen is a little trickier this stumped me for quite some time in fact I rang around and I couldn't get a very clear answer on this because it doesn't seem that many biochemists have thought about it this way that's not because they're silly or whatever they just haven't thought about it in this way which really surprised me because this bit of information is the most motivating bit of information I had in my personal little journey of losing seventeen kilograms in six months it's all gone breathe it out amazing you could anyone can do this it's not hard so how much carbon dioxide and water well the oxygen is important there's six atoms of it in a molecule but what are they going to become are they gonna go out as carbon dioxide are they gonna go as water are they going some ratio of the two how do you figure this out took me ages and then the answer turned up in a very old paper from the 1940s where they'd taken water labelled the oxygen atoms made them put some an isotope of oxygen on to those and oxygen 18 gave it to mice the mice had it go in their belly but then it came out in their breath so water had the oxygen in it but then that oxygen turned up in the exhaled breath which showed that oxygen atoms are exchanged between carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules there's a really good reason for that here's some phenylthaline in water it's a bit hard to pronounce it's got a bit murky because I've left it sit but look if your barn here changes color great whoop-dee-doo what does it show you show you the carbon dioxide dissolves in water forms carbonic acid there's an exchange of oxygen atoms so what this told me is that the way these six atoms are going to leave your body is in the same ratio that they exist in the molecule so that's a two to one ratio so that means four will go out as carbon dioxide and two go it is water that's great now I know the answer so now you do the maths so we've got the first two answers I'm gonna add to the carbons the weight of four of these oxygen atoms they're gonna go out with carbon so check that up there and I've got two to go so two times that there we go check that with the hydrogen's because they're gonna go out with some hydrogen and now I can figure out the ratio of carbon dioxide and water from my fat so there's the totals and now we've just got to divide it by the total total and you get 84% will go out as carbon dioxide and 16% will go out as water so here's the answer then to my big fat question 84% of fat is exhaled 16% is excreted as water somehow it can be in your urine and your feces sweat that means that 10 kilograms of fat becomes eight point four kilograms of invisible gas that you breathe out that's amazing every time you're doing some exercise and your breathing rate goes up you're losing more weight than when you're sitting down and not breathing as rapidly and one point six kilograms will come out as water now we don't know if that comes out in your poo or in your where and your sweater in your tears because you cry a lot who knows but now I've got some frequently asked questions that I need to answer because there's lots of them well there's three main ones one can I just surround a breathe more everyone asks me straight away well you can't sit around and breathe more but it's called hyperventilation you've got a coax 4c 55 h1 Oh 406 out of the fat cells they're called adipocytes and to do it biochemistry made it amazing what really goes on it's a long story but you need to get them out by first of all moving more or eating less you've got to sort of starve yourself of energy so that you start turning these big molecules of fat they get broken into three fatty acids each they're called a triglyceride but they have to be broken apart before they can come out of the cells the hidey-holes that they live in in your bingo wings or you have double chins or your butter your muffin tops or wherever it is it's hanging around in there it's not going to come out until this hormone breaks them apart into its fatty acids it goes into your bloodstream and then you can oxidize them beta oxidation big long story really complicated amazing that we know but FAQ number two is does weight loss cause climate change well this is another really disturbing little thing because it means people don't understand climate change they just don't because if you did you wouldn't even think that but people think so why doesn't it cause climate change because food was made by plants just in the last couple of years and the way it did it was it took sunlight and glued water to carbon dioxide when you eat you're actually the energy is sunlight it was put there by the Sun if I wasn't well I'm not a hippie but I just about am because I think that this is amazing you eat sunlight that's the energy that you get but it's modern sunlight when you burn fossil fuels that's ancient sunlight it's locked up in the ground as carbon in wood Deadwood ancient fossilized coal and oil is ancient dead fossilized critters that lived in the sea that photosynthesize that died that got buried that eventually turned it all this does not cause climate change and the fact that people don't know that means we need to teach them more about climate change no wonder there are so many myths about both these things there are myths about weight loss there are so many diet gurus out there mate if they didn't know this are you gonna trust anything else they have to say to you no hopefully not stop buying their books that pills their rubbish why did you not know this until today I don't know the answer but it certainly makes me very very skeptical about any health claim that anyone makes who's supposedly a guru the third question that you don't get asked but I should get asked that I don't get asked at all except the biochemist would be sitting there wondering it right now did you take into account ketosis and no not really I did not ketosis is when you starve yourself of carbohydrates when there's no glucose in your blood and you can do this thing called ketogenesis your liver does it and can convert fat molecules into ketone bodies there acetone is one of them you go to a nail shop get your nail polish removed acetone right your body makes that stuff but you don't want to make it in huge quantities because you go into acidosis so I'm not going to comment on whether or not eating low protein diets is a good idea because I'm not an expert on that I would say that I'd be careful because it's linked to depression apparently in some papers I don't know I'm not making any health claims about low protein diets what I'm saying is that this is very simple if you just do what I did and what lots and lots and lots of other people I don't want to meddle it's easy all you have to do to lose weight is turn it into carbon dioxide and water and to do that all you have to do is eat less move more and keep reading thank you  you", "jFk-L7Wcg0g": "(knocking) - [Host] Hey Arnie, we're here to see your gym and fridge. (knocking) (rock music) - What do you want? (rock music) - [Host] All right Arnold, we're here to see your fridge, you ready? Let's do it. - What is it exactly that you want to see in the fridge? You just want to see the food? Or do you want to bust me because I'm not 100% vegan? (siren wails) What is it that you're up to? Follow me. So anyway, this is the refrigerator in my office. We have here fruits, we have vegetables, we have one of my favorite things that when it gets hot, I have watermelons, cut-up watermelons. We have, of course, the Radler, which is a German drink a combination of lemonade and beer. I love it. (laughs) Most people don't know this, but this is my secret protein drink. I'm telling you one, okay. This is between us. Okay, so here we go with the protein. You wanted to see how our protein is made? It's nothing special about it. I just put in a little bit of this almond milk, not much, just a little bit. And those are for muscle soreness and sometimes bone soreness. Put a little bit of that in there. Then you go and you put the banana in. (upbeat music) I don't do it always with the clean hands where I touch every dumbell and barbell and machine that other people have already touched. This is just to get the immune system going and to really always, you have to fight back. Now there's an egg, a raw egg that you put in there. Well actually, I like to put in the whole egg. (blender spinning) Now, this drink, literally you could serve at any bar. Health bar or any other bar. I sometimes put in there Schnapps, I sometimes put in there Tequila, so it just gives a little extra flavor. - [Host] What does your diet look like these days? - Well, I am as you can see, I'm health conscious. I was not always health conscious because when I was young, you know you get away with a lot of things, a little bit from that. Now I eat more, you know, like oatmeal, and greens, and vegetables, and healthy foods. Stay away more from the meats and more from animal products, and animal proteins, because there was this misconception that's the only way you get big and strong, so now I backed off that and, um, I feel much better after eating more greens. - [Host] Do you cook at all? - Yeah, of course. My favorite thing to cook is a steak. A lot of times my bodybuilding friends come over to my kitchen or come over here to this office and they will of course eat the delicious food because they all want to look like me. It's never gonna happen. (laughs) I love that. Anyway, - [Host] What kind of snacks do you eat? Ya know, during the day I will make a little protein drink of course, because I think it is just the best, ya know, if you have a lot of proteins. I mix it with, uh, some of the milk here, and sometimes, uh, juices, and then sometimes I have energy drinks also so it really depends what kind of a mood that I am in and if I'm tired or not, because our energy drink is really great when you're tired. - [Host] Do you drink cow's milk? - I would say that I hate cow's milk. I drink almond milk. It is much better. - [Host] What other foods do you hate? - Um, I don't really hate much of anything. I just stay away from it because of health reasons, but I mean I always was called the garbage disposal, because I was never sick and tired of anything. I mean anything. As a matter of fact I would go to restaurants and I would say to \"people make me an omelet\", and they say \"what do you want in the omelet?\" and I said, \"anything that\\'s in the kitchen sink \"or anything that you can find on the kitchen floor. \"Just scrape it up and put it in there and I would love it\", and that's exactly what they did. - [Host] Have you ever tried a fad diet like Keto or intermittent fasting? - When I started film, I didn't have time for fad diets or anything like that. I have to go and go on a real serious kind of a regimen. I work out harder, I do more cardiovascular training, and I watch much more what I eat, so I cut out just simply all the sugar products, and I cut out all the white bread. - [Host] Do you take any supplements? - Yeah I take supplements, I take multivitamins, and I take, uh, you know, uh, everything that the body needs, but like I said they're called supplements to supplement of what you eat, so the key thing is not to rely on the supplements as much as you rely on good food. Natural food, a lot of greens, a lot of fruits, and a lot of really good proteins. - [Host] Does Arnold ever have a cheat day? - Cheat days come up quite frequently. I just remember that even three days before the Mr. Olympia competition in 1970 after training we would go to the House of Pies. The key thing is always to remember that for every calorie you take in, you have to burn it off. No one else is gonna do it for you. You've got to do it. (upbeat music) - [Host] How often do you work out? - Um, I workout everyday. I workout in the morning from around 7:00 to 7:45 and then I try to bicycle every morning for around 45 minutes, and then many times I go back at night, and I work out at home in my home gym. - [Host] What do you consider an intense workout? - What I am doing right now is not what I consider an intense workout. This is kind of a light Mickey Mouse workout because we are doing the filming right now so I just go through the motions, but I'm not really training that heavy anymore because, uh, after my heart surgery I was advised not to train heavy and not to do anymore going for three reps and heaviest weight and all this stuff, so I do more kind of lighter weights and more reps. - [Host] Do you still chase the pump? - The pump is always out there and you always have to chase after it, yes. - [Host] What's the best thing you've learned throughout your career? - When you become a world champion in bodybuilding, and you um, reach your goal like I did after winning 13 world championship titles. Seven of them is Mr. Olympia, five of them is Mr. Universe, Mr. International, and all of those kind of competitions. Then it is important to inspire others, because I recognize that I did not go the way I am today. I did not reach this point in bodybuilding, or in anything else, without inspiration of so many people. If it is in bodybuilding, Reg Park or Steve Reeves, ya know and in public service, Ronald Regan or Mother Teresa, Mohammad Ali, who was one of the most generous and most giving persons that inspired me to give something back to the community. There's all these people inspiring so to me it's important to hang on that wall and to have other people look up there and say \"Look what this guy has accomplished. \"He came over here from Austria with absolutely nothing \"and, uh, he became the world champion in bodybuilding, \"and he became the highest paid movie actor, \"and the leading man, and then he got into politics. \"Look at what he\\'s accomplished \"because of hard work and because of a lot of help.\" And so I am, I want to be an inspiration to so many others. - [Host] All right, now it's time for our Rapid Fire questions. 7:00 a.m. workout or 7:00 p.m. workout? - 7:00 a.m. usually - [Host] Squat or deadlift? - When you say squat or deadlift it's the same thing as saying drinking or eating. I mean I think you need both, right? It's a difficult, it's a crazy question. You should try and work at the whole body minimum of three times a week. - [Host] Crossfit, yay or nay? - I think it's good done the right way. - [Host] Dumbbells or kettle bells? - It makes no difference because the muscle doesn't see what you are holding in your hands. - [Host] Run on a treadmill or in the great outdoors? - Both. - [Host] Biggest compliment - jacked, ripped, swole, or cut? - Cut. - [Host] If you could workout with anyone in the world, dead or alive, who would it be? - I would like to workout with Eugen Sandow, because he was one of my idols. He was the first bodybuilder that also was a Strong Man. I think that, uh, he's a remarkable human being and a remarkable athlete and Strong Man. - [Host] You know a lot of celebrities on Gym and Fridge say you're their ultimate workout partner. What do you say to that? - I'm here in Gold's Gym every morning. If you want to workout come on down and well have a good time. All right, listen guys, I gotta get back to my workout, okay? The time for fooling around is over, so, over there is the exit, and don\\'t say \"I\\'ll be back\" okay? (upbeat music)", "H6n3iNh4XLI": "Translator: Samaher AlJudaibi Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla Well, I want to see a show of hands How many of you canceled his friendship with someone on Facebook because they said Something offensive about politics or religion Baby care, food? (Laughter) How many of you avoid at least one person who knows it Just because you don't want to talk to them? (Laughter) You know, for a polite conversation it was usual Follow Henry Higgins' advice at Mayfair Lady: Stick to the weather and your health. But these days with climate change and the fight against vaccination (Laughter) These topics are also unsafe So this world that we live in, This is the world in which every conversation is in She has the power to turn into an argument Where politicians cannot talk to each other And even in the least important cases She finds someone who fervently fights with or against her Not normal The Pew Research Center studied 10,000 adults in America And they found that at this moment, we are more polarized And more divided Than we have ever been in history. We are less inclined to accept a settlement This means that we no longer hear each other We make decisions about where we live Who will we marry, even who will be our friends? Based on what we really think. Again, that means we don't listen to each other Conversation requires a balance between talking and listening And somewhere along the way, we lost this balance. Part of this is due to technology Smartphones that are either in your hands Or close enough so that it can be eaten quickly. According to Pew Research Center About a third of American teenagers, send more than 100 text messages a day. Many of them, most of them, are more likely to communicate text messages with their friends From having an oral conversation with them face to face There\\'s a beautiful piece in \"The Atlantic\" It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. He gave his students a contact project He wanted to teach them how to talk about one subject without using notes He said: \"I came to a realization .. (Laughter) \"I came to the realization that conversational efficiency Perhaps the most overlooked skill was our failure to teach her Everyday, children spend hours exchanging ideas with each other through screens But they rarely find the opportunity To hone the interpersonal skills of relationships and communication This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any skill in the 21st century? More important than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation? \" Now, I earn my living by talking to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, Billionaires, kindergarten teachers, Heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people I like. And I talk to people I don't like. I talk to some of the people I deeply disagree with on a personal level. But I can still have a great conversation with them. So I want to spend the next ten minutes teaching you how to talk. And how do you listen Many of you have heard a lot of advice on this Things like looking at a person directly in the eye Think of interesting topics to discuss in advance Like, shake the head in the affirmative and smile to show that you are interested Repeat or summarize what you heard So, I want you to forget all these tips Because she is stupid (Laughter) Because there is no reason to learn to show that you are attentive, alert and interested If you really care (Laughter) (clap) Currently, I am actually using the same skills as someone who conducts professional interviews As I do in normal life So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people This will really help you learn to be a better speaker Learn to have a conversation Without wasting your time, Without feeling bored And please, without offending anyone We all had a really great conversation. We did it before, and we know how it is. The kind of conversation you feel after engagement and inspiration, Or when you feel you have made a real connection Or, you have been fully understood. There is no reason Why most of our dealings are not like that. So, I have 10 basic rules. I will accompany you through every rule, But frankly, if you pick and master one of them, You will have better conversations already. The first rule: Do not multitask And here I do not mean to leave your smartphone only Or leave your mobile device, your car keys or whatever in your hand. I mean, be around. Be present at the same moment. Don't think about the argument you had with your boss Don't think about what to have for dinner If you want to get out of the conversation Exit the conversation But not half of it is present and half outside Second: Do not express your opinion as if you were an expert on the topic If you want to express your opinion Without any opportunity to respond, argue, block or grow, Write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there is a really good reason why I don't allow critics to appear on my program: Because they are really boring. If they were from the conservative party, they would hate Obama and the food stamps and abortion. If they were liberal, they would hate big banks And the oil companies, and Dick Cheney. Completely predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You want to get into the conversation assuming you have something to learn. The doctor said to the famous psychiatrist \"Scott Beck\": Real listening requires a person to set themselves aside. Sometimes that means putting your personal opinion aside. And he said, he senses this acceptance It will make the speaker become less horse And more likely to show internal mysteries For his mind to the listener. Again, suppose you have something to learn. Bill Nye said: \"Everyone you meet will know something that you don\\'t know.\" I put it this way: Everyone is expert about something. The third rule: use open-ended questions. In this case, this feature was taken from journalists. Start your question with whom, what, when, where, why or how. If you ask a complex question, you will get a simple answer. If I asked you, \"Did you get scared?\" You will respond to the strongest word in the sentence, It is the word \"fear\". And the answer will be \"Yes, I was afraid\" or \"No, I didn\\'t hide.\" \"Were you angry?\" \"Yes, I was very angry.\" Let them describe it. They know what. Try to ask them questions like: \"What was that?\" \" How did you feel?\" Because after that they will have to pause for a moment to think about it. And you'll get a much more interesting response. Fourth rule: go with the current. This means that ideas will come to your mind And you need to let her out of your mind. Often times we hear interviews The guest is speaking for several minutes Then the host interrupts him with a question What seems to be out of context, and has already been answered. This means that the host stopped listening two minutes ago Because he thought about this very smart question, He was determined and determined to say it. We do the exact same thing. We're sitting here having a conversation with someone, And we remember that time we saw Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop. (Laughter) And stop listening. We are awaiting the moment we enter the story into the conversation About Hugh Jackman and coffee. Stories and ideas will definitely come to you. You need to let her come and go. The fifth rule: If you do not know, say that you do not know. Now, people are on the radio, especially NPR More aware that they are under registration, So they are very careful about what they claim to be expert about And they claim they know him for sure. Do it, be careful. Talk should not be cheap. The sixth rule: Your experience is not equal to their experience. If they are talking about losing a family member. Don't start talking about the time when you lost a family member. If they talk about the problems they face at work, Do not talk about how you hate your work. It's not the same thing. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And most importantly, the conversation is not about you. You don't need to take a moment to prove how amazing you are. Or how much I suffered and suffered. Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was and said: \"I have no idea that people who show off their wits are unsuccessful.\" (Laughter) The talks are not a promotional opportunity. [21st century talks] [How are you today?] [Read my blog!] The seventh rule: Try not to repeat yourself. It is an amusement, and it is really boring. We tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or when we talk with our children. We have a point we want to make clear. So we reformulate it over and over again. Do not do it. Number eight: stay away from weeds. Frankly, people don't care For years, or names, Dates, all those details That you try hard to remember in your mind. They don't care. They care about you. Care about how you are, What you have in common. So forget about the details. Leave it aside. The Ninth Rule: This is not the last, but it is the most important. listen. I can't tell you how many VIPs have said Listening is the most, and perhaps the only most important skill That you can develop. The Buddha said, I quote, \"If your mouth is open, you are not learning.\" Calvin College said, \"No one is really listening on the way to losing a job.\" (Laughter) Why don't we listen to each other? The first reason: We prefer to talk. When I talk, it's me who takes control. I am not obligated to hear anything that does not concern me. I am the center of attention. I can reinforce my identity. But there is another reason: There is no distraction. The average person speaks 225 words per minute. But we can hear 500 words per minute. So, our minds are filled with 275 words. And I know, it takes effort and energy, To give real attention to someone, But if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. You are just two people exchanging screaming sentences that are hardly connected. in the same place. (Laughter) You should listen to each other. Stephen Covey said it beautifully. He said: \"Many of us do not listen with the intention of understanding. He listens with intent to respond. \" Another final rule, number 10, is as follows: be brief. [Good conversation is like a short skirt, short enough to hold attention, And long enough to cover the topic ... sister] (Laughter) (clap) All this boils down to the same basic concept, and that is: Be interested in people. As you know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather And there was some kind of ritual in our house. People would come to talk to my grandmother or grandmother. And after they left, Amy was coming to us, And she was saying, \"Do you know who this was?\" She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. And so it arose on the assumption Everyone has something subtle and wonderful about them. Frankly, this makes me a better hostess. I try to remain as silent as possible. Keep my mind open, I am always ready for something that surprises me I have never been disappointed. Do the same Go talk to people, Listen and listen to people, Most importantly, be prepared to be surprised Thank you (clap)", "PMiiOZBRwyM": "how many times have you done an exercise and then as soon as you finish you feel pain you might feel it in your lower back or your shoulders but you find yourself thinking did I do something wrong or does this exercise just suck well in reality it isn't always you there are a lot of exercise out there that are plain bad for you and they only continue to exist just because they've been passed down from one misinformed gym bro to the next and no one's been smart enough to realize that these common exercises are no good so today we're going over 10 exercises that all men should avoid and these exercises aren't only exclusive to men women should avoid these exercises as well it's just that in this video we'll be sticking to exercises that I usually find men doing wrong the very first one I want to start with is actually a group of exercises that guys are drawn to like moths to a flame I'm talking about all the selector Iser ab machines at your local gym the machines that you usually start by sitting down pulling out the pins selecting your weight then grabbing some handles behind your head and doing some crunches these machines are not only a waste of time but they're also very dangerous for your lower back all these selector eyes are ab machines are locked into a range of motion meaning that your joints and your discs can't travel down their natural path you can only travel down the path that the machine has set for you even if you somehow adjust the machine to your body perfectly which by the way is very hard to do but even if you somehow had a machine custom-built for your body you can still easily run into lower back issues because you're still locked in a range of motion throughout the entire exercise besides a greater potential for a lower back injury you will also get significantly less results from these machines and if you just stick to regular ab exercises like crunches and sit-ups hanging knee tucks and decline sit-ups the reason is once again due to the fact that you're locked into a range of motions the cores main responsibility is stabilization and it's important to improve your functional core strength because your core isn't only responsible for stabilizing your trunk and your torso but it also stabilizes your whole body it's the bridge that connects your lower body to your upper body when you're locked in a range of motion you take all the stabilization normally required for ab exercises out of the movement the really ironic part is that those abdominal stabilizer muscles that you're not working with these machines they're very important to strengthen in order to prevent the lower back injuries that you'll likely experience on one of these machines do the fact that you're not working your stabilizers you're missing out on all those deep tissue abdominal muscles like your transverse abdominis and you're only targeting mostly your rectus abdominus which is the very outer layer six-pack looking muscle the transverse abdominis is very important to work on because not only does it help prevent injury but it also pulls your stomach in keeping everything nice and tight and giving you that flat stomach look if you really want to make your ab exercises tougher use weights by simply holding a dumbbell or a plate either behind your head or across your chest while doing regular traditional ab exercises once again if you don't know exactly where to start start with exercises like stability ball crunches decline sit-ups and hanging knee tucks the next exercise you should avoid is the behind the head shoulder press first off there's absolutely no advantage to going behind your head none even though I'm sure some old-school guys will be disagreeing with me in the comments below you can research this yourself and you'll find when you go behind the head you're still targeting the same muscles that you would normally target if you went in front of your head and there's no advantage when going behind your head that'll allow you to for example build more shoulder muscle faster instead what will happen when you go behind your head is you'll be putting your shoulders in a very compromised position to go behind your head you're gonna have to externally rotate your arms outward putting your rotator cuff in a very unstable and weak position this will immediately require you to lower the weight that you're using for your shoulders this already creates a huge disadvantage when compared with just going in front of your head with a heavier weight by lifting a heavier weight in front of your head you'll get more strength improvements and more muscle gains over time on top of that in that compromised position that has no advantage you're very likely to hurt your rotator cuff most people already have very tight protracted shoulders because sitting slouched over all day to compensate for a lack of shoulder flexibility and mobility people that try this exercise will bend their neck forward to get the bar behind their head increasing the risk of injury not only to your shoulder joint but also to the neck joint and again keep in mind the guys that you see performing this old-school exercise at the gym are doing it for no reason because there are no proven benefits for going behind the head only risks and disadvantages so when you do your presses simply keep the barbell in front of your face the whole time trust me your shoulders and your neck will thank you and you'll also see much more results next up is the smith machine and yes the smith machine itself can be used effectively as a supplement to your workout but the way that most guys use it is wrong and should be avoided a perfect example is using the smith machine for squats many guys believe that by sticking to the smith machine for most of their compound lifts like squats and presses they'll help prevent an injury with the smith machine due to the fact that it looks like a barbell in a squat rack it's very easy to forget that it's not a free weight exercise meaning it does not have a free range of motion at all just like most other select riser equipment it's locked into a range of motion which like I said earlier will immediately take the stabilization benefits away from whatever exercise you do when using the Smith machine specifically with the Smith machine squat you're putting yourself into a very unnatural squatting pattern first of all the whole time that you'll be doing the exercise you'll be leaning your weight back this would be impossible to do with a regular barbell because you would simply fall backwards rather than allowing your back to bend as you come down your back is forced to stay perfectly straight which to most beginners might make it seem like you would decrease the risk of a back injury but it only increases it especially because your hips are also not allowed to freely move throughout this movement a squat is a very natural movement that was performed daily before the invention of things like toilets during a squat your hips and your back should be allowed to curve and then around its natural range of motion this exercise on the other hand creates a very unnatural range of motion that you should avoid do regular barbell or dumbbell squats with proper form instead another exercise that men should avoid is one that I actually find women doing even more than men the hip abduction and adduction machines there is no natural movement that would load your hips with the kind of heavy weight that you'll be lifting on these machines in that movement pattern this machine is known for causing serious lower back injuries because it's not normal to lift a heavy load in that position these muscles are normally simply used to stabilize the body when you stand walk or run however almost everybody I've ever seen use these machines at the gym is super proud of the heavy weight load they're able to lift in this very unnatural position if you're really concerned about working your adductors and your abductors then perform exercises with resistance bands while standing rather than using these two seriously dangerous machines another very dangerous machine for your spine is the seated torso rotation machine this is the exercise where you stick your knees in between two pads and twist your lower body left and right to work your obliques supposedly the problem with this is that when you rotate your spine your hips are designed to rotate as well once again due to the fact that the machine is locked into a range of motion your hips cannot rotate properly putting excessive pressure on your spine you're a lot more likely to end up with a messed up back rather than a nice set of abs when doing this machine there are many far better ways that you could work your obliques without risking a back injury such as cable Wood chops and side planks next up is the upright row to perform this exercise you would usually use a barbell with an overhand grip and raise the bar up towards your chin with your elbows flaring out the problem with the upright row is that as you come up your arms rotate internally more and more to complete the movement due to this internal rotation in combination with this usually being a heavy weight bearing exercise many people experience a shoulder injury or impingement when doing this exercise in fact even performing this exercise correctly will immediately put you into an impingement position because it has the rotator cuff moving in an on actual way especially when you add weight to the movement physical therapists will put you in a very similar position to the upright row to test for impingement so you don't want to be doing an exercise designed to test for impingement especially not for reps and sets with a heavy weight load over time it can and will lead to an overuse injury also there are far more effective exercises with far fewer risks involved first off you can raise your hands above your elbows as you come up for this exercise rather than having your elbows above your hands if you want to work on the front and the lateral head of your shoulders regular lateral raises will usually give you more than an upright row without the risk if you want to strictly work on the front of your shoulder then you could lean back in a bench and do incline frontal raises and for the traps you could do things like clean and presses and snatches all of these exercises can provide more benefit without the risk involved with upright rows the next problematic exercise is the lap pull down behind the head too many guys in the gym must be thinking that their Rocky Balboa or something when they rep it out with this exercise the lap pull down behind the head is bad for all the same reasons that make behind the head shoulder press is bad once again just to get the bar behind your head you're going to increase the chances of a rotator cuff injury because you need to rotate your arms externally as far as they can go again due to the fact that most people already have a lack of flexibility in their shoulders you'll also increase the risk of injury to not only your shoulders but also to your neck and finally the nail in the coffin is that once again you won't be able to lift as much weight as a regular lat pulldown meaning you'll be building less strength and less muscle over time while risking unnecessary shoulder and neck injuries this is once again another exercise with nothing but disadvantages hmm who would have ever thought that when an exercise has done the right way the way the exercise is meant to be done you get more results the next one that I want to go over I already know is going to make a lot of people in the comment section mad but I want to help all of you avoid an injury so let's talk about the leg press machine the leg press machine is very bad mechanically for your body because it does not allow your muscles and your joints to perform in a functional manner and it puts a huge amount of stress on your knees and your lower back when you naturally lift weight with your legs your back is allowed to move freely but on the leg press your back is pinned against the pad because once again you're in a lock range of motion it has very similar problems as performing the smith machine squats some people are actually able to get away with doing this exercise without too much of an issue but I've also seen an equal amount of people hurt their lower backs because your back winds up in an awkward flex position the whole time regular barbell squats walking lunges deadlifts split squats and a number of other leg exercises are far more effective and functional than this one so I recommend that you stick to those whenever possible speaking of useless leg exercises you should also avoid leg extensions and leg curls unless you're rehabbing an injury or unless you're looking to be a body builder these two exercises don't serve much of a purpose they're not functional they put excess stress on your knee and there are far better alternatives that can help you build more functional leg muscle in less time they also isolate the knee joint which is very unnatural because whenever you normally work your knee joint in real life you're also working your hip joint the worst part is that all the strength that you build from this exercise cannot be applied mechanically to most movements that you would encounter in real life the last exercise that I want you to look out for is the back hyperextension machine even though there is a safer way to perform this exercise a lot of the people that do it do it completely wrong and they wind up hurting the lower back in the process the spine is not meant to extend past the point of neutral at any time with this exercise so many people extend their backs past that point on every rep that they come up and they wind up with a strain lower back or a full-out injury to their discs even when doing this exercise properly you could still hurt your lower back just by performing reps with a weight held against your chest for that reason if you do try this exercise be very careful and start with just your body weight to avoid a lower back injury that's it guys I really hope this video has helped you out if you enjoyed it make sure you subscribe to this channel for more free content and if you're not exactly sure about

want to say you know as somebody who also works in the fields of hypnosis and stage hypnosis I've always surprised by the way the general public sees it I would I believe that most people probably see hypnosis is really about you know turning people into chickens basically and another thing if you ask somebody who's a little bit let's say a little more paranoid that you'll find out that hypnosis is really about mind control and you talk to somebody who's a little more traditional and you'll find out that hypnosis is really about sin and something's quasi diabolical here's an example of a son Gally who is a 20th century film star who is a evil hypnotist now even among the scientific community there's been studies that show serious studies that show that there is no such thing as hypnosis that the hypnotic state does not actually exist and I think that even if you talk to let's say educated people such as yourselves that you'll find out when you boil it down that hypnosis appears to be some kind of magician's trick mind trick and that when you boil it down it's ultimately completely and totally fake now what if I said to you that if we don't understand hypnosis is it possible that we could be being hypnotized right now you basically don't know so I'm gonna make a suggestion let's call it a hypnotic suggestion i suggest you that hypnosis is entirely real in fact stage hypnosis is real and hypnotherapy is real here's an example of some of the many things that are treated with chemotherapy as well not only that but accelerated learning by hypnosis is real and the hypnotic bar as previously mentioned a bar where people are hypnotized to be completely drunk while they remain absolutely sober is also real hypno surgery where you can be operated on while completely awake is also real and of course absolutely that being turned into a chicken under hypnosis is also completely real maybe I could start off by saying there's good reason why we don't understand hypnosis and these are some of the reasons we go way back in time probably the first hypnotist were shamans aboriginal and native shamans here's an example a real example from 1914 but Shawna's generally didn't share their secrets there's one man who really put hypnosis on the map and that's this guy Anton Mesmer an Austrian doctor he was so influential that the word to be entranced to be mesmerised is from his name Mesmer Mesmer was the talk of paris and in the 1780s more than three thousand people a day would often go visit Mesmer to be healed he would do strange incantations he would appear to knock people out he would give them and hold them with magnets and thousands of people would come to see him regularly now this attracted the attention of the medical establishment of the time and they put pressure on the king of France Louis xvi who actually organized a Royal Commission to investigate Mesmer which was led by this guy Benjamin Franklin now the interesting thing about Benjamin Franklin is at that time he was the ambassador to France and also a great scientist and he and another group of scientific luminaries got together and they investigated Mesmer they concluded that there was nothing to Mesmer's claims that he was not really healing people and as a result Mesmer was treated and named a fraud and a charlatan in fact here's some popular artwork at the time that shows Mesmer being sent to the fires of obscurity by the light of Reason science and justice I would say that till this day as a result hypnosis hypnotism lives in the shadows in fact if you go to a bookstore often in North America or Canada and ask for books and hypnotism you'll usually be referred to the occult section so this is why hypnosis remains in the realm of the fake now if that's true if hypnosis is fake can I propose maybe a simple test that basically we perform right here this is a quasi scientific formula that we perform a series of very simple hypnotic inductions and maybe some hypnotic suggestions and we see what happens if if not if no if hypnosis is fake then nothing will happen if it's real then I guess we'll see is that okay  okay alright so if anybody is nervous and there always is a few people that are nervous I can suggest to you that you can avoid this process by simply ignoring my instructions for the next three minutes simply ignore my instructions and you'll be fine for the rest of you I'll just suggest you that right now you put your feet flat on the floor so focus on the center of the spiral and now I'll ask you to take a deep breath in take a deep breath in watch as the spiral moves very good and now take another deep breath in straight up towards the ceiling and now allow your eyes to just slowly blink on the count of three two one you can blink now very good and asking to blink one more time and blink now reopen your eyes and as you do as my hand drops you're gonna feel your eyes getting heavier your eyelids are going to get heavier heavier and a few seconds you'll just allow them to close three two one you can shut your eyes now beautiful as you close your eyes you get a very deep relaxed feeling and that allows you to feel like almost like your eyelids are melting into your cheeks you're so relaxed and calm and in fact your eyes are going to close tighter and tighter that they are now shut very good the more you try to open your eyes the more they will stay shut you can try to open your eyes but the more they stay shut and as few seconds I'll ask you to do a test and see if you can open your eyes but the more you try the more they are shut right now get anybody open their eyes very good now on the count of three you will be opened your eye you will be able to open your eyes if you can't let's go one two three now you can open your eyes beautiful who could not open their eyes just now who could not put up your hand if you don't mind could put up your hand okay good the people who could not open their eyes I miss gesture you come up on the stage for the next part of our experiment you could not open your eyes come on up the stairs are over there the stairs over there come on up you could not open your eyes very good people that are more hypnotizable are often more imaginative some of the greatest athletes in the world are very hypnotizable they're often strong and brilliant and beautiful as these people clearly are so now just gonna do a little bit of an experiment though if you guys don't mind so I'm just gonna ask you to stare at the light that little light at the end of the room right there very good now here's the interesting thing I didn't ask you sir just to put your hand out put your hand out and push down in my hand push down my hand harder harder harder sleep all the way in dropping down all the way relax and sleeping and ask you right back here very good I'm gonna ask you just to push your hands out like this very good don't worry don't worry feels good just push your hands up like this if you don't mind ready go take a deep breath in stare at that light you focus very good focus deeper three two one sip all the way and dropping down to sleep beautiful very good some people are not gonna react now just what your hands go down hand goes down up down and now sleep beautiful very good now this next person very good we do something this is a new induction that we developed for TEDx actually it's called a TEDx induction just stare at that spiral and ask you to put your hands up like this like an X that's right except facing the other way beautiful now stare at the light take a deep breath in and relax hands a little more straight very good as it cut me down it lets you didn't notice that your heart is beating because you're on stage all these people are looking at you look at the light and just focus on the light take a deep breath in relax them sleep all the way in very good rock them down all the way very good relax and calm now  I'll explain I'll explain in a second okay sir same thing push your hands out like this deep breath in just watch my hand go down just watch it right here go down down down down sweep all the way up drop him down all the way very good excellent shake your hand breath in and sleep all the way and drop him down all the way very good person okay right now I'm gonna say a word when you understand what that word means it's gonna happen to you you understand so just there at that spiral Sara that lights why right there and I say the word SL e t sleep beautiful very good excellent person I'm just gonna ask both you to stick your hands up like this both of you deep breath in stare at the spiral and everybody sweep all the way up very good nothing a beautiful and you can just rock down and sleep it's okay very good excellent  you're so amazing and just say sleeping's gonna happen very good dropping down excellent I'm gonna leave these people up here so you can experience are you okay for being up okay so what these people are experiencing is something that we call hypnotic sleep hypnotic sleep is actually they appear to be sleeping but I'm gonna suggest you that that is not true they are not actually sleeping here's some examples and they show some examples if not its sleep so here's some examples of hypnotic sleep and one of the reasons why we don't understand hypnotic sleep is we tend to focus on the hypnotist and not the people who are actually sleeping so now I'm gonna go a little bit closer take a look I'm gonna suggest to you that these people are in a very interesting state now do they look like they're sleeping and I'm gonna suggest to you that they are actually awake and alert if you can hear my voice and you know what's going on you have the power to lift a finger on your right hand you can do that now if you can hear my voice you can lift a finger on your right hand now beautiful take a deep breath in and relax and now go back to sleep beautiful relaxing all the way they are actually still here they haven't gone anywhere I'm going to suggest to you that right now these people are in a state that is akin to what you might call sleep paralysis sleep paralysis is a state where we feel like we are sleeping but actually every night when you go to sleep you become paralyzed by your own body so that if you dream that you are running or falling or jumping you don't actually jump out of your bed or run out of your bed so this state is right now sleep paralysis you notice that people are quite relaxed and limp okay so let's do a little bit of an experiment let's do a bit of an experiment right now and I'm going to suggest at this point that people are very open to suggestions so maybe I'll start with this fellow read here when you hear the word hypnotism person I'm touching me now when you hear the word hypnotism you will shout it's fake when you hear the word hypnotism you will shout it's fake when you hear the word hypnotism you will start laughing you will shout I am in complete control of all my actions do a bit of an experiment and I must try something else there probably people in the audience right now that are actually in trance so I can ask you to take a deep breath in anybody the audience and you can go right back to sleep beautiful anyone the audience is relaxed and sleepy so anyone in the audience who hears the word hypnotism will also shout it's fake okay very good so now coming back into the room feeling refreshed and relaxed remaining in trance on the count of three two one when I snap my fingers now when I am talking right now about hypnotism fake what I'm trying to illustrate is that something hypnotism is not it's not it's not well understood okay it's not well understood what do you think of hypnotism big if I could just ask this person for a second what do you think of it clearly clearly you do now I'm going to show you something in my right hand I have a sleep gun this is a gun it cannot hurt you but when I shoot you with this gun you're gonna go right back into a deep and relaxing sleep on the count of three two one bang sleep and bang sleep and bang sleep very good so these people are in a very relaxed state these are sort of our all-stars here now I suggest you there's something very interesting going on with these people and it's something if you want to look at it it's actually in the eyes now I don't know if you can see it clearly but you see this person right here can you see it their eyes are actually flickering now why would their eyes are flicking on to suggest something interesting that their eyes are actually rolled up in their heads now why would that happen isn't that kind of weird and I'm going to suggest you let's go back to our friend the shaman look at the shaman his eyes are also rolled up you can look at here is it a little bit closer you can see a little bit closer and now let me show you something else that sometimes when people are in this state you can see his eyes are flickering the people are in this state that they they sometimes remain with their eyes open that looks a little bit like this now look a little bit closer and of course we get an effect that looks almost diabolical in fact this is straight out of the Exorcist and it may explain this stereotype so now let me show something let's go back right here and let me suggest to you that there's probably a reason why this state actually occurs and maybe I'll start with this person right here that is it possible that the original hypnotist to use the stereotype of hypnotist somebody uses a pendulum that goes back and forth but that pendulum going back and forth is doing something particular to the eyes let's do a little bit an experiment this is a induction developed by Mike Mandel a Canadian hammer test I can ask you man if you don't mind if you can just sit up for a second I snap my fingers you can sit up now I'm just gonna ask you just to look at my finger right watch it keep your head steady and watch it go back forth back forth your eyes get heavier and a few seconds they will just close back forth now you can just go relax to sleep beautiful look at her eyes are flickering so she has entered a state and I hope that this is kind of sciency she's entered a state that is very similar to REM now is it possible that what hypnosis is doing is jump-starting the actual REM State now to show you perhaps an interesting example of why this must mat might matter let me show you a video take a look at this [Music]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music]  so I know that's a pretty ridiculous video but let me explain this actually something very profound going on here and that is there's actually a veterinarian rodent wrote an article for the newspaper that explained that what's actually going on here is that cats are actually reliving traumas they're not but here's the weird thing why are cats afraid of cucumbers because cucumbers remind them of what or look like what snakes exactly they look like snakes but hold on a second with domestic cats in North America or in Kingston anywhere like that would they ever encounter a snake no never so why would domestic cats all seemingly be programmed to already be afraid of snakes that they've never met the explanation very simply is that professor Michel Juba experimental medicine the University of Lyon the sixties did a series of experiments he's called the Christopher Columbus of dreams and his theory is that mammals are all mammals while they're in the womb basically enjoy a powerful REM state a dream state that dream state may be essential to programming us to be what we are so cats would be programmed to be afraid of snakes while in the womb that would be an explanation for why they are now afraid of cucumbers even though they never encounter snakes that make sense so now is it possible that hypnosis is us hacking in to this actual dream state and let's take a look here's a here's a here's a common experiment you probably remember the movie the matrix and the matrix neo is programmed to know kung fu it's advanced technology helps them know kung fu and I'm going to suggest to you that we can do something like that today I'll take this person right here you are a kung fu master now and you're going to demonstrate a new form of kung fu in the red dot known as TEDx a powerful dramatic form of kung fu you will always remain safe and you will not push your body beyond its known limits you are also a kung fu master you will perform an even more dramatic form known as TEDx squared you will also always remain safe and you will perform your kung fu exhibition right after the first one so I can ask this person to come back to the room in the count of three two one mice at my fingers please meet the master of Kung Fu right now sure you want demonstrating the rare and beautiful TEDx form  hi what he cook  Sara coming back to the room now you are a kung-fu master you will beat that come that incredible demonstration that you only heard you're going to perform this is the form now known as TEDx squared  thank you now I want to take us from in conclusion maybe back to the the chicken what is really truly amazing actually is that when I do hypnosis shows I used to avoid ever turning people into chickens because it's cliche and silly but then I actually learned something amazing when you do the research there's something amazing about people being chicken so I'm gonna do a demonstration deep breath and relax and sleep beautiful maybe Tara you can go read like to sleep beautiful very good you are a chicken Peck and you say macaw you do all the chickeny things you are a chicken that's right you do all the chickeny things you're a great amazing chicken you madam are a cat you are cat and you're very much like a cat now [Applause] chickens can come out you can step up here now one thing about chickens and cats  [Laughter] [Applause]  now I'll just ask you remind you as chickens and cats you have been programmed to be mortally afraid of cucumbers if you see an image if you see a picture or an image of a cucumber you will scream you will scream anyone sees a picture of a cucumber here will scream now cat do you see the chickens sure do you see the chickens  [Applause]  now I'm going to ask all of you you don't mind to direct your attention to the screen  [Applause]  sorry ok ok it's alright it's alright it's alright go back to your you can go back to your that's right you can go back I'm gonna make a suggestion now [Applause]  here's a simple demonstration of hypnotherapy now when you see a cucumber you will no longer scream you will only laugh you'll laugh incredibly hard you'll be unable to stop laughing now  [Laughter] [Applause]  [Laughter] very good you can have a seat right now so I'm gonna give you Tara I'm gonna give you the sleep gun here's a gun and what we do take this gun I want you to shoot the cat over there I want you to shoot him he won't be hurt you're gonna go into a deep relaxed state and then I'm gonna ask you to shoot yourself okay and go into a deep and relaxed state so here's a sleep gun right now you can just make a loud bang that's all shoot the cat over there if you don't mind go into a deep relaxed state and sleep beautiful very good when you shoot him he'll go into a deep relaxed state very good  okay now I know that we all laugh at the guy and has stands for the person that becomes a chicken but actually this shows a very profound and amazing aspect of humanity humans have the ability unlike other mammals apparently to dream just about anything we can imagine ourselves as chickens as aliens as any kind of weird associated thought or or feeling and that really shows why humans have such a powerful and it's a sonnet to some extent limitless imagination I'm going to suggest to you that hypnosis itself remains completely uncharted it is still misunderstood and that the state that these people are in when they come out of the state they're going to feel wonderfully refreshed and relaxed that's because with hypnosis we hack into the fundamental programming state which also happens to be a state that is itself tremendously recuperative this dreaming state is tremendously recuperative and healthy and you're going to see these people will come out of it feeling very healthy relaxed and clear so in conclusion I wish want to say hypnosis is not the preserve of hypnotist or hypnotherapist even it is the common massive and amazing inheritance of all humanity and that's something that the world needs to know so in conclusion the people that are in a hypnotic state and the people that includes the people in the audience if you're hypnotized in a few seconds you'll come back into the room you're going to feel refreshed and relaxed and wonderful you've done an amazing job you're really incredible and magical when you come back in the room you're gonna feel refreshed relax no longer hypnotized there's only one catch you'll have no idea what happened while you were on this stage you will forget everything that happened to you on this stage until you hear me say the word fake then everything will come flooding back to you you remember everything and you will laugh okay so I would just like to say in conclusion I hope today that I have demonstrated that hypnosis is totally and completely fake  thank you very much [Applause] [Music]  you  [Music]", "xYemnKEKx0c": "So this story begins: I was at a friend\u2019s house She had on the library shelf a copy of the DSM manual Which is the diagnostic and statistical guide for mental illness. And it contains every mental illness that exists. In the past, in the 1950s, it was a small, thin booklet. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, Now it is a 886-page directory. It currently contains 374 mental illnesses. While I was reading it, I was wondering if you had any mental illness, It turns out that I have twelve of them. (Laughter) I have generalized anxiety disorder, This is necessarily known. I have nightmares disorder, Which is put under classification If you have frequent dreams that you will be pursued or declared to be a failure-- And all my dreams include people chasing me on the street Shouting \"You are a failure\" (Laughter) I have problems with the relationship between parents and the son, Which I blame my father for. (Laughter) I'm joking. I'm not kidding. I'm joking. And I have the disease. And I think it is a rare fact Have disease disease and generalized anxiety disorder, Because disease disease makes me feel very anxious. Whatever it was, I was looking through this book, Wondering if I was more crazy than I expected. Or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose that you have any mental illness If you are not a trainer to work professionally in this field, Or maybe the psychiatrist profession has a strange desire To label what is considered normal human behavior as a psychological disorder. I didn't know which of these two things is correct, But I thought it was a rather interesting idea. And I thought maybe I was supposed to meet a psychiatric critic To get his point. So I ended up at the lunch table with one of the Scientologists. He is a man named Brian He runs a special operations team of Scientologists Determined to fight psychiatry, wherever it is. They call the CCHR So I told him, \"Can you prove it to me Psychiatry is a false science that cannot be trusted? \" He said: \"Yes, we can prove it to you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said: \"We will introduce you to Tony.\" I said, \"Who is Tony?\" He said: \"Tony is on Broadmoor.\" Now, what he means by Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It was known as the \"Broadmoor Sanctuary for Unreasonable Criminals\". There they send serial killers And people who are unable to help themselves. Then I said to Brian, \"What did Tony do?\" He said, \"Hardly anything. Hitting someone or something like that, Then he decided to claim madness to get out of prison. But he claimed madness very well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor No one can believe that he is sane. Would you like us to try and get you to Broadmoor to meet Tony? \" And then I said, \"Yes, please.\" So I took the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn irresistibly at Kempton Park, Apparently, this is what dogs do when they're anxious-- Irresistibly yawning. And we got to Broadmoor. I was taken through a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate To the recovery center Where you can meet patients. It looks like a giant hampton The whole place has peach and pine trees and its colors are comfortable. The only glaring colors are the red color of the emergency button. Patients began to move in. They were a little full and wore cotton sports shorts And they seem easy to comply. Brian whispered Scientology to me, \"They are under the influence of medicine,\" Which is considered to be the worst thing that could happen in the world. But what I thought was probably a good idea. (Laughter) Then Brian said: \"Here's Tony.\" There was a man walking inside. He did not look fat, his body looked very good. He was not wearing these cotton sports pants, He was wearing a striped suit. His arm was outstretched Like a man exited from \"The Apprentice\" He looked like a man wanting to dress up Convince me that he is very sane. Sat down. I said \"So, is it true that you occupied to reach here?\" He said: \"Yes, yes. Of course. I hit someone when I was seventeen. I was in prison awaiting trial, My cellmate told me, Do you know what to do? Call madness. Tell them you're crazy. They will send you to any of the many hospitals. Where the nurses will bring you some pizza. You will own your PlayStation. \" So I said, \"Well, how did you do that?\" He said, \"I asked to see a prison psychiatrist. And you've watched a movie called \"Crash\" Where people get sexual pleasure by bumping cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \"I get sexual pleasure from bumping cars into walls.\" So I said, \"And what else?\" He said, \"Oh, yes. I told the psychiatrist I want to see women die Because it makes me feel normal. \u201d So I said, \"Where did you get that from?\" He said, \"Oh, from Ted Pandey's autobiography That they had in the prison library. \" In any case, he claimed the disease very well as he put it They did not send him to Wathira Hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the moment he got to this place, He said he took one look at the place, asked to see a psychiatrist, He said: \"There has been a terrible misunderstanding. I am not mentally ill. \" I said, \"How long have you been here?\" He said, \"Well, if I had implemented the sentence I was sentenced to imprisonment for my original crime, I would have taken five years. I've been to Broadmoor for 12 years. \" Tony said it is very difficult to convince people that you are sane To convince them that you are crazy. He said: \"I thought it was the best way to look natural You may be by talking to people naturally about natural topics Like football or what is shown on TV. I am subscribed to \"New Scientist\", And recently it had an article How the American army was training hummingbirds to smell explosives. So I said to one of the nurses, \"Do you know that the US Army trains hummingbirds? To sniff out explosives? \" When I read the medical notes written about me, I found that they wrote: \"It is believed that bees can sniff out explosives.\" He said, \"You know, they are always looking for Non-verbal signs of my mental condition. But how do you sit sane? How to put a leg on the other in a rational way? It is impossible. \" And when Tony said that to me, I thought, \"Am I sitting like a journalist? Should I put one leg over another like a journalist? \" He said, \"You know, on the one hand, I have the tendencies of a serial killer like Stockwell Strangler The \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" usurper is on the other side. So I tend to sit in my room a lot because I find them terrifying. They consider sitting for a long time in the room as a sign of madness. They say that this proves that I am lonely and arrogant. \" So, only in Bordmore, the unwillingness to go out and walk around with the serial killers It is a sign of madness. Anyway, it seemed completely normal to me. However, what do I know? When I got home, I sent an email to his doctor, Anthony Madden. I said, \"What is the story?\" He said: \"Yes. We accept that Tony claimed the story of madness to get out of prison Because of his hallucinations, which seemed vulgar to start with Which disappeared the moment Broadmoor entered. However, we have evaluated it. We have decided that what he is is that he is upset. \" And in fact, fake the madness It is precisely the kind of cunning and manipulative behavior of the disordered. She is on the list; cunning and manipulative. So claiming that your mind has something wrong It is evidence that your mind already has something wrong. I talked to other experts, They have said that the striped suit - a classic disordered mind. Speaking of points one and two in the list of symptoms; Sweet-spoken, superficial personality charm and a transcendent sense of self-worth. I said, \"Well, he didn't want to mix with other patients?\" Classical disordered, this is evidence of great feeling as well as a lack of sympathy for others. Hence, all things that looked more natural in Tony It was evidence, according to his doctors, However, he was ill in this new way. He was disturbed. His doctor told me, If you wanted to know more about psychopaths, You can go to the Psychopathology Training Course Run by Robert Hare, the man who invented a list of psychopathic symptoms. And that's what I did I went to a psychopathic discovery course, And now I'm certified-- And I must say, I am very skilled-- As a discoverer of psychopaths. Here are the statistics: One in every hundred ordinary people is psychopathic. Well, there are 1,500 people in this room. Fifteen of you are psychopathic. Note that this number increases to 4 percent From executives and businessmen. So I think there is a very good opportunity There would be 30 or 40 psychopathies in this room. A massacre could happen at the end of this night. (Laughter) (laughter) So Herr said that capitalism is at its extreme Rewards psychopathic behavior-- Lack of sympathy for others, sweet talk, Sly, disingenuous. In fact, capitalism is in its cruelest brutality, It is a physical embodiment of psychopathology. It is like the type of psychopathic That is affecting all of us. Hare said to me: \"You know what? Forget this person in Broadmoor And who may, or may not be a paranoia. who cares? This is not an important story. The important story, he says, is \"they are psychopathic companies.\" You need to interview some psychopath companies. \" So I made an attempt. I addressed people at Enron. I said, \"Can I have an interview with you in prison To find out if you are psychopathic? \" They did not respond to me. So I changed the tactic this time. I sent an email to Dunlap \"Electric Saw\" Originated since the 1990s. He was involved in companies that fell and cut 30 percent of the workforce Simply referring entire American towns to ghost towns. I sent an email to him and said: \"I think you have a very rare brain defect That makes you special And interested in predatory spirit and not to fear anything. Can I do an interview with you? About your rare brain defect? \u200b\u200b\" He said: \"Come.\" Then, I went to the great Dunlap Palace in Florida Which was filled with sculptures of predators. There were lions and tigers. He was taking me through the garden. There were falcons and eagles. He used to tell me: \"There are sharks.\" He was saying this in a less sinister way. \"There are also more sharks and more tigers.\" It was like the Kingdom of Narnia. (Laughter) Then we entered his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlop was being brought in to rescue the companies that went bankrupt. He was laying off 30 percent of the workforce. And he would often fire people from joke, For example, one of the most famous stories about him, Someone came to him and said, \"I just bought a new car.\" He replied, \"Maybe you have a new car, But let me tell you what you don't have, job. \" Well, in his kitchen, he was standing there with his wife Judy And his bodyguard Sean. I told him, \"I remember how I told you in the email Could there be a rare defect in your brain that makes you unique? \" He said: \"Yes, it is an amazing theory. It's like Star Trek. You go where no one has seen you before. \" I said, \"Well, some psychologists might say This makes you ... \"(grunts) (Laughter) He said \"What?\" I said \"psychopathic.\" And then I said, \"I have a full list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I pass it on with you? \" And he seemed very interested against his will, And he said \"Okay, go ahead.\" I said, \"Okay, a transcendent sense of self-worth.\" And what I have to say is that it was difficult to deny it Because he was standing under a giant oil painting drawn to his person. (Laughter) He said, \"Well, you have to believe in yourself!\" I said \"manipulative.\" He said \"This is the leadership.\" I said \"shallow expressions: Inability to express the extent of feelings. \" He said, \"Who wants to be burdened with some trivial feelings?\" So, he was passing the points on the psychopathic list Mainly turning it into \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" (Laughter) But I noticed something that happened to me on the day I spent with the Dunlap. Whenever he told me something he looked normal For example, he answered \"No\" to juvenile delinquency. He said he was accepted to West Point, They do not accept people with a history of events at West Point. And none answered in short marital relations. He only got married twice in his life. Acknowledging that his wife mentioned in her divorce papers He once threatened her with a knife. He said that as long as he wondered what the taste of human flesh is, But people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages at the height of verbal quarrels His second marriage lasted for 41 years. So, whenever he tells me about something that might seem non-psychopathic, I say to myself, well I won't put this in my book. Then I realized that by being a psychopath observer It has turned me a little into psychopaths. Because I was striving to squeeze it into a box that reads psychopathic I was striving to know him as crazy as possible. Then I realized, my God. This is what I have been doing for 20 years. This is what all journalists do. We travel around the world with our paper notes in our hands And we are waiting for jewelry. And jewelry is always a ceiling In the characters we meet. And we sew them together like medieval monks. We leave natural things on the ground. This is one of the countries that diagnoses many mental illnesses far more than the reality. Bipolar disorder in children - children four years old They are classified as bipolar disorder Because they have tantrums, Which makes them score high on the list of bipolar disorder. When I returned to London, Tony phoned me. He said, \"Why didn't you answer my calls?\" I said, \"Well, they say you are psychopathic.\" He replied, \"I am not psychopathic.\" He said \"Do you know what? One of the paragraphs in the list is the lack of remorse, While the other one on the list is furtive, manipulative. When you say that you regret your crime, They say; exactly like psychopathy Cunningly claiming that he feels remorse while he is not. \" It's like magic. They turn everything upside down. He said \"I have a trial soon. Can you come to it? \" I said well Then I went to trial After 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go out. They decided that he was not supposed to be held indefinitely Because its high scores on a list Which could mean that he has above-average chances of a reversal. So they let him go out. And outside in the hallway he told me, \"Do you know what, John? \"All people are somewhat psychopathic.\" He said \"You. I. Well, obviously I am.\" I said \"What are you going to do now?\" He said: \"I will go to Belgium Because there is a woman there I dream about. But she is married, so I will make her separate from her husband. (Laughter) Whatever it was, this was two years ago, And here is where my book ended. In the last 20 months, everything was fine. No bad thing happened. He lived with a girl outside London. It was, according to Brian the Scientologist, It replaces the past time - which I know looks sinister, But it is not necessarily doomed. Unfortunately, after 20 months, He returned to prison for a month. He got into a fight in a bar, as he called it-- Which ended up going to prison for a month, Which I know is bad, But it is at least one month that means whatever quarrel, It was not so bad. Then call me on the phone. Do you know what? I think it is right for Tony to be outside. Because we are not supposed to know people about their craziest limits. And what Tony is on is that he's semi-psychopathic. It is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find complexity, Where you find humanity And where you find the truth. Tony told me, John, can I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. \" I did not go. If you were me, what would you do? Thank you (clap)", "cuIlP5uII6A": "today you guys are in for a real treat before we get to the science on this channel we often have these fun little intros you can skip to the science but some have told me these are the best part this story introduces a new character to our channel very closely based off of one of my not so bright roommates from the past his name is Fez wick I want you to imagine the ideal lifting buddy Fez wick was the total opposite of what you're imagining mixed in the ego and facial expressions of Derek Zoolander and you have a fez wig so we were at their school gym now I've been lifting here for a few years and built up a decent strength face so before I hit my working sets I'd warm up with 20s 40s 60s and 80s before hitting the hundreds for my main set Fez wick was the kind of guy who was always pretty suspicious so when he noticed this he immediately thought I was up to something you really like to jump the weights huh is what he said but I'm pretty sure he was thinking more along the lines of so that's his secret he's not telling me I just need to make big jumps in the weights only because I've been doing this for a long time so these are my warmups right he jumps the weights up if I do that too I'll be just as strong as him he just doesn't want me to be on his level trust me man stick with the 45s and you'll make progress real fast faster than you might think huh Dorian what's up oh hey I saw you in class not Professor was really annoying Hey [Music]  dude what you just dropped a hundred pounds on your face you're talking about that old news as I pretended to listen to my girlfriend that night I couldn't help thinking back to Fez wick attempting to lift a much heavier weight than he could handle was lifting heavy always the way to go well that is gonna depend more specifically on what your own goals are as we will see one thing that has been thoroughly proven regardless of gender or age resistance training results in muscle growth lifting weights is also called resistance training because you are contracting your muscle fibers against resistance in this case the resistance is gravity resisting your muscle as you move the weight through space each muscle is made up of thousands of individual muscle fibers resistance training results in this growth thanks to a phenomenon called Meccano transduction were specific sensors in your individual muscle fibers known as mikanos sensors convert this mechanical energy into chemical signals that mediate Myo cellular anabolic and catabolic pathways in other words once they detect that their fiber is under enough load to trip a certain threshold they start signaling that the muscle fiber needs to grow  something important to note also is that not all muscle fibers are the same well they all contribute something to every rep range type of one fibers are better suited to long lasting endurance well type 2x fibers are better suited for that one rep max explosive power well some people use weights with the intent on building their muscle size others lift weights to train for strength lifting can be confusing people will often tell you different things some will say do high reps with a light weight to maximize muscle hypertrophy others say use a heavy weight and go until failure and what about strength are heavy weights with low reps really the only way the idea that you need to go heavy is based on the idea that heavier weights are needed to achieve full recruitment of those higher threshold fibers the ones that are the most stubborn descending the growth signal because optimal improvements in strength and hypertrophy can only be accomplished when all the fibers in a muscle have been activated but what does the research say in 2016 a meta-analysis was published in the European Journal of Sports Science big props to Brad Schoenfeld for heading this up it compiled nine studies on this topic and set out to answer this question once and for all in all of these studies two groups of participants were compared where one group was lifting weights that were above 65% of their one rep max strength while the other group was lifting less than 60% and both groups lifted the weight until they couldn't do another rep the meta-analysis acknowledged that type 2 muscle fibers the ones that are better for heavy weights than endurance have a 50% greater capacity for growth and while that is true it has been demonstrated that even these fast which type 2 muscle fibers the ones that are best for intense bursts of strength are worked by low weight just do a lesser extent this is why it isn't entirely shocking what they found in terms of muscle gained the high and low weight groups both gained a similar amount how can this be well although a single rep of a heavier weight versus a lighter weight will provide greater activation to the type ii fibers the key lies in the fact that both groups took their sets to momentary muscle failure so although the light weight group got less activation Perret their sets lasted much longer and those additional reps although they were a lighter weight continued to activate the muscle until even the most stubborn fibers activated so it looks like both light and heavy weights as long as taken to momentary muscle failure result in about equal hypertrophy I see that because although it wasn't statistically significant there was still a slight trend in favour of the higher weight strength was a different story because although strength is highly correlated with muscle hypertrophy there are various other elements at play physiological factors psychological factors including confidence and fear their motor control and technique and CNS adaptations all play a role these are better trained by lifting those heavier waves so if my max bench is 225 whether I train in sets of 135 to failure or 185 to failure the muscle hypertrophy will be about the same as long as total work volume is equal where's my 1 rep max if tested on the spot might increase slightly more under the higher load training due to those other factors of strength being more in practice lastly it should be mentioned that muscle size and hypertrophy aren't one in the same because of this people who do high reps with lightweights may benefit from the illusion of larger muscles this is because your muscles store their energy along with water which can influence how big they look at any given time despite not being the result of hypertrophy glycogen content in the muscle can significantly alter the appeal size of the muscle at any given moment glycogen is the primary fuel burned by your muscles after about 10 seconds of activity and continues to be the main mover until about a hundred and twenty seconds the advantage of it is that burning it is an anaerobic process meaning it doesn't require oxygen so the power output isn't limited by your ability to breathe in oxygen if you aren't eating any carbs at all such as during a fast or keto diet muscles can look up to sixteen percent smaller this is why people on aggressive diets complain that their muscles look really flat if you're eating carbs glycogen is stored in the muscles based on their predicted need for it the average person who doesn't resistance train stores about 350 grams or so in their muscles and since each gram is stored with three grams of water about 1.5 kilograms or 3 pounds of muscle bulk in a typical person is glycogen in bodybuilders who train in higher rep ranges which often exceed 10 seconds the body predicts a greater need and stores more than the typical amount more than double in fact giving them a 6 to 8 percent boost in muscle size over the average non lifter simply from stored carbs it has been theorized that someone who trains in low reps mainly for strength may not see quite as much glycogen storage in their muscles because these low rep sets rely less on glycogen while this theory is often referenced that has yet to be definitive proof in the form of a scientific study but personally when I went from training in sets of 3 to sets of 10 I noticed my muscles appear fuller as they adapted to my new training demands by storing more glycogen but I have to say and I think others will agree going to light does have its drawbacks not only do the studies show a tiny bit less hypertrophy it can also be harder to reach an equal volume going to failure with a very light weight can be a lot more agonizing which is something to keep in mind so light weight heavy weight it seems like for hypertrophy taking two or close to failure is what matters primarily if you want to be guaranteed equal results which i think is a good excuse to mix it up no one says you need to pick just one switching it up every now and then can keep workouts exciting and challenging while providing a more targeted stimuli to all the different fiber types but just remember to listen your own body and go off of what is heavy and light to you and please don't be a fez lik thanks for watching and if you're into it consider subscribing until next time d-man signing  you", "FuWL9RF7rl0": "unsubstantiated bro science has circulated the fitness community with many fictitious claims from the idea that we must consume protein within 15 minutes of training or will shrink to the belief that if we don't eat every two hours our body will begin to use our muscle for energy but the truth is although it's complete these claims aren't hurting anyone right wrong although eating six meals per day could be potentially helpful and having protein immediately following the workout won't hurt there are a few lies plaguing the fitness industry that can ruin your ability to put on any muscle whatsoever that said I want to shed a bit of light on these myths and at the same time share simple and effective methods for building the body you want faster lie number one carbs make you fat the reason experts believe this myth is understandable carbs increase insulin and insulin is a storage hormone that forces our body to store fat however the evidence is pretty clear that the insulin response from food intake doesn't determine the amount of fat you store total energy balance does what they also fail to mention is that insulin is responsible for driving amino acids into our muscles thus elevating protein synthesis this is vital for maximizing muscle growth fact is if you're looking to put on lean muscle through weight training you should never avoid carbs the reasons are twofold one carbs are converted to glucose our body's main energy source and to glucose is stored in the muscle as glycogen blood glucose and muscle glycogen are the most important elements in the formula for maximizing physical performance avoiding carbs to minimize fat gain is like not flying for the fear of crashing but driving on the highway to work every day taxi you're worried about the wrong thing if we go low-carb we've got to go high-fat but a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that fats are more efficiently stored as body fat than carbs they added that and I quote excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate which actually makes perfect sense especially since there is plenty of evidence that carbs are inefficiently stored as body fat even when over feeding this is due to a highly regulated metabolic pathway known as de novo lipogenesis bottom line if you want to get big and strong eat carbs lots of them line number two train for size not strength when I hear this I cringe it's like saying you want to drive the six-figure Lambo with the engine of an electric car here's the deal muscle is a byproduct of strength and unless you're getting stronger you're not getting bigger period seriously when's the last time you saw a jack dude struggling to bench 135 pounds never don't get me wrong I'm not saying you should stay under 5 reps and max out every few weeks or completely eliminate bicep curls and replace them with more squats and deadlifts what I am saying however is that unless you're adding more weight or more reps you're not going to stimulate further growth the way we produce new muscle tissue is quite simple we introduce a stress and our body adapts to that stress by building muscle in order to handle it again later this can be done in two ways number one increase weight without sacrificing reps or number to increase reps without sacrificing weight now I know what you're thinking a line you've said that the main pathway by which we build muscle is volume so doesn't that mean we could just add more sets sure this can be done but studies show that it's only possible to a certain degree before we experience diminishing returns only is this strategy not efficient passed a certain threshold but it's impractical the bottom line is you don't have to train like a powerlifter but you should always walk into the gym with one goal in mind do better than I did last time if you're a caveman like me bring a pen and a pad into the gym with you to record your lips if you're a bit more sophisticated use an app regardless of how you do it track your progress lie number three Monday is chess day if Monday and only Monday is chess day then your is broken this isn't to say that you can't make decent gains while training each muscle group once per week but if you want to maximize muscle and strength low-frequency training just isn't going to cut it so whenever you hear someone crying about how sore their quads are from leg day just know that it's not because they went ham in the gym it's because they're training their legs too infrequently and if your trainer tells you you'll over train if you hit chest two times per week fire him a study that was published in the journal of strength and conditioning research compared training one day per week using a split body workout versus three days per week using a full body approach researchers found that subjects who trained a single muscle group more frequently throughout the week despite no changes in total volume experienced significantly more muscle growth than the low-frequency group another more recent meta-analysis concluded that when comparing studies that investigated training muscle groups between 1 to 3 days per week on a volume equated basis the current body of evidence indicates that frequencies of training twice a week promote superior hypertrophic outcomes to once a week bottom-line follow a higher frequency training split that targets each major muscle group at least twice per week more importantly though find a workout that you are excited about regardless of what science might suggest there is no factor more important than adherence line number 4 you have to eat clean what exactly does it mean to eat clean last 10 different experts and get 10 different answers truth is there's no such thing as a clean or dirty food the same way you'll never drop dead from eating one burger you won't wake up fit from chugging a greens shake don't get me wrong I'm a big believer in following a predominantly whole food minimally processed diet but I'm also a huge advocate of flexibility the notion that you have to quote unquote eat clean to build muscle is not only subjective but extremely misleading this type of advice is what leaves people dazed and confused about why they're not growing or getting stronger the fact of the matter is it's not just about what you eat but how much of it unless you're in a positive energy balance and consuming enough protein fats and carbs you won't grow have you ever tried getting a thousand calories from broccoli and chicken breasts it's just not practical bottom line if you want to grow you've got to ensure you're in a caloric surplus consuming more calories than you're expending following a diet that provides sufficient protein dietary fat and carbs is critical if your goal is to build muscle I don't care how clean you're eating if you're not eating enough you're not going to grow lie number five high reps for definition I'm not sure where the hell this came from at the idea that high reps shapes or tones the muscle is complete a muscle can do three things grow larger get smaller or remain the same size the shape it takes is completely up to your genetic make another problem with this claim is that like clean eating it's very subjective what exactly are high reps is it 12 to 15 15 to 20 50 or more either way training in any of those rep ranges requires that we reduce intensity there's no way in hell you're pushing 80 percent of your 1 rep max for 20 reps in fact one study concluded that you would have to perform three times the volume when using a lighter load to get the same results you would from a moderate weight a study published in the European journal of applied physiology compared a low moderate and high rep group to no surprise of my own the low and moderate rep groups produce significantly more hypertrophy than the high rep group not because you can't build muscle with a lighter load but because intensity matters and if you want to build muscle as fast as possible you've got to lift heavy bottom line lift heavy weight if you want to get a better gauge as to how heavy

hero movies do. - I always wanted to train like Chris Evans. Something about his shoulders makes him so unique, that dorito shape shoulder to waist ratio. - My favorite super hero on the screen is definitely Black Widow. Great butt, toned abs, most of it is the legs. - When I look at these characters in the movie like Captain America, Thor, Superman, Batman. Rarely you get to see Asian characters that are powerful, reliable. I feel like there is not enough representation of Asian super hero figures. - So we're going to be training with a professional personal trainer. He has trained a lot of celebrities. He gave Chris Evans the super hero body. And now he plays Captain America and looks absolutely incredible. - Me, as Korean, really want to see if I have what it takes to achieve the super hero look. - I think I'm ready to look super buff. - Hi, I'm Steve Zim, and I'm the owner of A Tighter U fitness studio in Culver City, California. I've written three best-selling fitness books, and I'm going to train Kelsey and Evan like their favorite super heroes. - You personally trained Chris Evans. You showed me a before and after picture, and his shoulders just got like 10 inches wider. I want that dorito ratio. (laughter) That's what they call it! - We're going to do a five day a week plan. You're going to work out with me minimum one hour with weights, and then depending on our body fat situation, how much cardio. With Kelsey, Kelsey is starting at a really good spot. But we're talking super hero. Her shoulders are rolled way forward. You have to have everything standing up straight, looking great. And then the other part is we have to make sure she is even. I don't want one arm bigger than the other arm. We need to make everything symmetrical. The back of her leg, we want to separate the hamstring from the glute. Really important for a woman to have that. It almost looks like a bow from a bow and arrow the back to the leg. Evan looks a lot like Chris when he started. Slender, good shape, and if you look at him, he looks fantastic. We're going to take him from looking great to looking unreal. I've created a program for him to round out his shoulders, so we can really separate his shoulders out from his arms. That's going to give us what he calls the dorito look. - It was very interesting to see all these numbers that represent my body. Like the size of my sweater, and the size of my pants, that's literally all I know about my body size. - I found out Evan only had to do 20 minutes of cardio, and I had to do essentially double or triple the cardio he had to do. Women carry more body fat than men. That's just how we function on our bodies. - We use two products. We take these before our workout, and then after our workout. Their basically protein. It helps enhance muscle fiber, and melatonin helps you go to sleep. The deeper we sleep, the more growth hormone naturally is created in our system, which helps us keeping us lean, getting us stronger. This is what we do. I look at what we start with, I break it down. And then I create the exercise program that's going to make them pop on film. - First week was just awful. I was waking up before the sun was up. - I never wake up at six a.m. in the morning for anything. It was uhhh, it was just uh God. - A lot of his exercises are very different from what I've been doing. There's a lot of twisting, squeezing, and holding. Like the first day of training, he gave me a five pound dumbbell. He instructed me to do this one exercise where I bring my arm back and twist. I've never felt that weak in my life. - It's not about the weight. I don't care how much you're lifting. The weight is so secondary. It's technique, it's isolation, and it's about not swinging the weights. It's about bringing the weights. - I was really surprised how many butt exercises there are. I had never really done anything for my butt. - The first week just had so much pain involved. - And I was sore every single day. (laughter) And it was a different body part on rotations. - My abs were screaming for help. I couldn't take off my shirt because my shoulders were hurting so bad. - I couldn't walk up the stairs to get to my desk. - The first week is always a big shock because your body doesn't know what's going to happen. - Yep, this is going to be harder than I thought. - When's my cheat day? - When you're telling me we have four or five weeks to get you in shape, we don't have time for a cheat day. - I had to change my diet too, and I think that was the thing I struggled with the most. - The nutrition program I've put these guys on feeds the muscle, starves the fat. The idea is you have to get enough calories to feed the muscle from the work we're doing. Make sure that we're not eating sugar and a lot of carbs that will feed the fat because we don't have the time to do that. We want to just shred these guys up. - My friends wanted to go out for pizza, or wanted to go out for pasta, and those are all things I can't have. And I hate being the person that's picky. - I ate approximately 7,000 Greek yogurts and 3,000 chicken breasts and salmon. - Now that I'm used to this diet, every time I eat something I can taste how much sugar or how much sodium something has. - We asked him if we could eat In and Out, and he said we could essentially just eat a patty and lettuce. - Which is fine by me because that's what I eat anyways. - It was not fine by me, so I bailed and ate cheese. Like my body, I can feel the dairy. That was really eye-opening for me. All of the sudden I had to think about every ingredient that was put into anything I ate. And I realized that I had never before seriously thought about what I consumed ever. - It's eight a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, sigh. At least there's no traffic. Throughout the weeks, I was seeing changes in my body. My biceps were showing a little bit, my abs were showing. - I remember the first time I had my friend take a photo of me, and I noticed all these muscles in my back that had never been there before. It was really cool to be like, having these random muscles. - And I never realized abs were so hard to get, like one mistake or one off-track, your abs are gone. - Good. (laughter) Boom. - It's getting easier to wake up in the mornings, managing the food is getting easier. The trick might be just to like, just to keep going until it becomes habit. It's a little bit addicting, working out. I see how that is a thing now. (techno music) The day of the last weigh-in, I honestly really wasn't looking forward to being weighed again. I didn't want to judge myself and think, oh, I could have done better. But I think that how Steve did it was really great, in that it was more about the progress, and being proud of the work that we did. - I was actually really excited to find out how much I changed. Kelsey and Steve were making all of these faces after they saw the measurements. I was like is that a good thing or a bad thing? - We'll start with Kelsey. We built your shoulders up. By having that, you might gain a little width, but what that allows us to do is have a nice taper down. The chest, I kind of figured this. You were a 34, you're still a 34. - Yeah, boobs still boobs. - And the thighs, they were uneven. Now you are completely symmetrical in your legs. Symmetry, we hit it. Weight, 123. Nine pounds down. But that's not the important one, it's the body fat. And that's what gives the difference in the appearance. 20.3, 6.2 percent down. That is insane. - [Kelsey] My result was much better than I expected. I was so excited, and it was a lot of change. It was really cool to know that all this hard work really did stuff. - Okay, Evan. Number one part of the dorito, your around. You went to 48.5. 4.5 inches wider up top. - Wow. - Chest ended up at 39.25. Now here's an interesting thing. His waist started at 30. I didn't think he had anywhere to go down. He went down an inch and a half. - He's a dorito! - He created the V. We thought there was maybe not that much body fat to lose, but apparently we did. So the legs are symmetrical, but here come the biceps. Now he's at 13.75. The body fat ended up at 6.6. - [Kelsey] Yeah. - So you're telling me I lost weight, but gained a lot of muscles here and there. - Yeah. - You lost all the fat, and then gained all the muscle. - That's so interesting. - This was only a one month thing. I still don't have raging abs or like giant biceps, but I think I'm off to a really good start to transform further and better, and that's the whole point. - It really makes you feel alive to feel your body and get to know your body. I still think I'm going to use a lot of this in my day-to-day life in a less intense aspect. - I have a lot , a lot of respect. All the Hollywood stars, all the personal trainers. Their clients who are working really hard towards their dream body. - Going through, even just a small fraction of what they go through is absolutely insane. And all the pressure because you are going to be seen by people looking this way at that date no matter what. Just hat's off to those people that have that drive. - They don't wake up like that. They put in so much effort, time, and energy. There's no way of cheating in your life. - Forget those infomercials, go out and work out hard. Do it the right way. - Hey Evan! Wait, it's really close. - I'm going to eat it. - Okay. (crunching) I'm proud of you. (laughter)", "330Ufcaj1zA": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavalier, Athlean-X.com. Today I'm dishing out the truth to the reasons why you might not be building muscle. I think I'm more qualified here to speak about this topic than anybody because I lived that. I lived those problems, I've had those same struggles. I couldn't build muscle. This was actually me. You guys have asked to see what I looked like. This is me. I dug up some old footage the other day. I was looking through some old home movies. That's me, in high school. Painfully thin, unable to put on muscle. Things have changed for me though, because I've learned from a lot of my mistakes. I think if I can talk about some of those mistakes then you might be able to avoid them, too. The very first thing that I learned quickly, early on was that I was overtraining. Overtraining, I've talked about in many videos before. It's a very real thing and a very real thing that sets up a roadblock for many guys that consider themselves to be hard gainers, or just unable to add muscle. You see, we always think that more is better. We've been conditioned in this society to think that more is better. When it comes to training, more is not better. More is not better. Only the right amount of the right type of training is better. As soon as you start going down that path you become even more likely to continue to go down that path because you try more and that doesn't work. So what do you do? You do even more, and then you do even more. Before you know it you're doing 55 sets for chest alone and your chest looks like shit. So you want to try to follow and find the fastest way for you to cut back on what you're doing. If you're going to train \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a very important point, this video encapsulates what we're all about here at Athlean-X. If you're going to be a drug free, unassisted lifter then you'd better find ways to enhance your recovery. Most of us are not able to. Without the assistance of drugs, we're unable to recover nearly fast enough to allow ourselves to go back to that gym to do another 55 sets, and another 55 sets and we wind up hitting a wall. It's a very real wall. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let anybody tell you differently. There is a wall that you hit hormonally, neurologically. You can't train. You can't even bring the effort that you need to produce the gains that you're trying to see. That leads me to my next point. Guess what most people do wrong when they're trying to build muscle? You may be shocked when is ay this; you're undertraining. How can you be undertraining and overtraining? Because undertraining is when you show up at the gym thinking that just by walking into the gym and gracing everyone with your presence, swiping your gym card, grabbing your protein shake and then heading over the leg extension machine that you're going to build muscle. If you head to a gym and your goal is to count reps, count to 12 over and over and over again I could save you a trip. You could have stayed home and counted with Sesame Street as opposed to going to the gym and wasting gas if that's all you're going to do. The numbers that you're doing in the gym, the reps that you're counting don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean shit. If you want to build muscle, the only thing that ever matters is the intensity that you're bringing to those numbers. If you're at 12 and it seems like you're trying to lift a house on the 12th rep and you've got nobody around to help you, that's a good effort. If you're at 12 and you're doing this and you're looking around and you're putting the weights down and waiting, you go back and can do it again and you're looking forward to the next set, you go down and you're looking forward to the next set just because it's sooner for you to get out of the gym; you're not training with nearly the intensity that you need to make changes. So how do you manipulate the two? How do you manage the two? It's actually kind of easy. As I say all the time; you can either train hard, or you can train long, but you can't do both. If you're at the gym doing 2 and 3 hour marathon workouts there's only two things going on. You're either assisted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using steroids that you shouldn't be \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or your half-assing it. There's only one or the other. You can't do it any other way. If you bring that high level of intensity to what you do, and that high level of focus to what you do and you're not spread so thin doing a whole bunch of everything, doing none of it really well; you'll find that you'll get an extremely intense workout and an extremely effective workout in about 45 minutes or so. Maybe an hour tops, and you're out. You're out. You're able to recover and allow your body the opportunity that it gets to recover to build and allow you to build back and come back stronger. That's how you want to manage those two extremes. Next up: people tend to avoid the hard exercises. Again, I'm guilty of it. I avoided the hard ones. You know the hard ones; we all know the hard ones. The ones where it's like the impending doom of the bar that creates a threat to you and your comfort level in the gym. Bench pressing. The treat that the bar could come down on your chest. There's a pending doom. You're threatened by the security of exercise. Squats, dead lifts; who wants to get down there and try to lift that. You know how hard it is to lift the bar out of that position? That\\'s why it\\'s called a \"dead lift\". No momentum. You\\'ve got to get that bar off the ground. Those are the exercises that tend to deliver the most bang for their buck though. If you want to build muscle, you'd better build your foundation of strength and build it with those key foundational exercises with those scary exercises, with those intimidating exercises. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to jump in and do what everybody else is doing. Just because I see everybody else benching 300-400 pounds, or squatting 400 pounds or whatever it might be, that doesn't mean that I have to start there. We all start somewhere. We all start at the bottom. No matter who you are, you start somewhere and you build from there. That's what makes us great as humans. We can develop ourselves to become \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the capacity is endless to what we can become. But it starts somewhere; usually down toward the bottom. You build your foundation learning how to do those exercises properly and then you add from there. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away just because they seem hard and they seem intimidating because they're going to be intimidating, but they're going to hold the biggest benefits. Just by doing those exercises doesn't mean that you're accomplishing everything that you need to accomplish. A big mistake is thinking \"Okay, I did the exercises. Now what?\" Well, how'd you do them? What was the purpose? What was the purpose of your training? If you're trying to go for hypertrophy, maybe a power clean is not the best way to go. Power clean is great if you're trying to be explosive and build top level explosive strength as an athlete, but it's not a great hypertrophy exercise. There's no real eccentric portion of the lift. Not a controlled eccentric targeting any one muscle group. Even though the eccentric is there it's a very quick eccentric. There's other ways I could do that. I could do really slow eccentric shoulder raises if I want to build my deltoids. Again, different purpose, different time, different exercise, different application. People will take power lifts and they'll be doing them from high reps. Why? What's the purpose of that? Don't misapply the exercises that you're using, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away from those that are the most intimidating or the most scary to you because they often hold the key to your most growth. Nutritionally we all make mistakes. I made plenty of mistakes. I was the biggest junk food eater. I've talked about that so many times. The biggest junk food eater on the planet. No doubt, I know there's no \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I own stock in Entenmann's just because of how much I ate of their stuff every morning, and afternoon, and when I got home from school. I wasn't building muscle. I was that painfully skinny guy. How the hell could that happen? Blessed with a fast metabolism? Maybe. But why couldn't I build muscle? Because even though I was over nourishing in terms of the amount of calories I was taking in I was under nourishing my muscles. That's all that matters. I was not providing the nutrients that my muscles needed as a substrate for growth. You see, it's a very important difference. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide yourself with the right type of calories, calories alone will not help you to build muscle. Think about every skinny guy you know who eats a ton of food and just can't do anything. I can tell you, the fastest way to fix him. The fastest way to fix him is to tell him to stop worrying about all the shit that he's eating and start focusing on eating the right stuff. If he starts to eat the right stuff I bet you his muscle growth soars over the next year because for the first time in his life he's finally providing his muscles with the fuel it actually needs to grow. It's like trying to grow a lawn with the worst grade fertilizer and seed versus high grade fertilizer and seed. There's a reason why there's a difference in price because one of them is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\\'s the \"shit in, shit out\" concept. One of them is not going to grow you a good lawn, the other one is. You could put a whole ton of that crap seed down and it's not going to do anything. You put the right amount of the good stuff down and it will. On the flip side of the coin, when you do clean up your diet one thing you'll want to be aware of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a big piece of advice here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is make sure when you make your substitutions, think about what you took out and what you're putting back in. you're taking out a lot of calorie dense, nutrient thin food. That's what you're getting with Entenmann's. Calorie dense, fat laden \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you're getting rid of all those. By doing that you're losing a lot of calories. What you might find is, when you replace it with the more nutrient dense you're going to have a lot fewer calories going back in. the nutrient dense foods are, by nature a lot of times, much more lower in calories. So you'll find that you'll struggle to put on size because you're undereating. The first think you'll want to do is: don't throw up your hands and say \"Sorry. This way of eating doesn\\'t work, Jeff. You told me and it didn\\'t work.\" No. Now you want to start making sure that you're eating more at every single meal. Every opportunity that you can, you're trying to drive more of that nutrient dense food into your body so you can increase the calories to be able to get to that level that your muscles need to be able to help you to grow. Get enough protein, make sure you're following a strategy to get you there. One of the strategies I use all the time is supplementation because for me, the liquid intake of those extra calories, those extra high quality calories, those extra proteins that I need; that makes it so much easier for me to take it in and around my solid meals throughout the day, and number two: it allows me to be very, very consistent. Consistency with nutrition is key. You can't make a change today, follow it for one day and think that you're going to start building tons of muscle just because you ate well one day. You've got to make sure that you apply yourself. This is a long term approach. You want to start eating right, and eating right for a lifetime. You can do it if you identify foods that you like and then have a strategy from being consistent with it. Supplementation often comes in here in a very valuable way to allow you to get that stuff in without really feeling like you're eating so much throughout the day. So, tying a bow around all this, this is what Athlean-X is all about. It's what it's all about. Let's pursue the best you that you can be, drug free. Let's pursue what you do in the gym with a purpose. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just show up. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you're making me happy because you walked through those gym doors. You make me happy when you walk through those doors and you lay your ass on the line and you put everything you've got into that workout and then you get out of there and allow your body to recover. Stop having a fear of those hard exercises. Those hard exercises are the things that you fear the most and the things that will change you the most. I've had that very same fear. Build up your ability to perform those exercises safely. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just go and jump in and do what everyone else is doing because they're lifting a lot of weight on those and you know you should be lifting a lot of weight on those. You build your strength by starting at the bottom and you work your way up. I show you how to do that in all of our programs. I show you how to jump in at any level that you're at right now and push yourself to that next level. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t misuse the exercises. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do what everybody else is doing because everybody is doing it. You do it because it makes sense for where you are in your program. You do it because it makes sense for what you're trying to do at that very moment in your program. When it comes to nutrition don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that it\\'s unimportant. That \"Oh, I\\'m just a hard gainer. I won\\'t be able to put on muscle because I just have a fast metabolism.\" I\\'ve seen the hardest gainers put on muscle when they approached their nutrition right. So stop focusing on just eating calories. Start focusing on getting the right kind of calories. Get nutrient dense foods into your diet. Then from there, adjust if you have to. Increase the amount that you're eating at each and every opportunity. Add supplementation if that allows you to be more consistent, but there's a fact of the matter here, guys. There's no shortcut around this. It pisses me off when I hear about shortcuts. You guys know that's a soft spot for me. There's no substitution for being serious about what you do. Take your workouts and your nutrition seriously. I guarantee you'll get serious results. If you are looking for a way to get serious results, guys; I'm more than happy to deliver you the workouts, nutrition plans, step by step everything you have to do. You're just not going to get it sugar coated from me. I'm going to tell you everything you've got to do and you're going to do it. I can't come there and lift the weights for you. I sure as hell can't come there and eat the foods for you. You've got to do it the right way, you've got to follow it with an intent to change your life because you will. Guess what? Things change in your entire life when you get this thing right. You know how you feel if you feel like you can't build muscle. You feel like you're skinnier than everybody else, you feel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was there. I know how it felt. I showed you the picture before. I wasn't really comfortable there. I was a little bit insecure. You know how much it changes your life to where I can get on here and deliver messages like this to you and have the confidence to be able to deliver messages to you and hopefully change everybody else's life so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go through what I went through. If you're ready to do that, guys, I'm more than ready to take you by the hand and do that for you. Head to AthleanX.com right now and come on board. Join team Athlean.

See ya.", "93b3D1rNlZs": "", "_ruRiTeX1jE": "well ladies and gentlemen good afternoon to you what an absolute pleasure to be here quick question who here owns a Ferrari seriously not a single one a couple of weeks ago I saw something that you don't see every single day it was an accident between a Ferrari and a VW Golf by the time that I arrived the VW Golf was on one side of the road and it was a little shorter than it was meant to be originally and on the other side of the road was this what used to be a six foot three gleaming red Ferrari but was now a four foot two slightly more crunchy Ferrari and you drive past that and you think to yourself that's a really bad day for some wealthy individual and it's not something you see every day so I pulled my car over I put a little fit a comment on Facebook and I said let's have a moment of silence for the mighty fallen never again to go from nought to a hundred in six point three or three point six seconds and the reaction that I got from some of my friends on Facebook was interesting people said they didn't say things like what a shame what a pity our what a loss they said serves him right and the hatred just kept on coming one comment after another how can he drive a car like that in a country like this our roads are wrong for it he was probably drunk one person stopped just short of accusing him of being a child molester and it was fascinating to me just to see the level of hatred aimed at this Ferrari driver now here's the interesting bit about it the only information that I put on Facebook was there has been an accident between a golf and a Ferrari that's it we don't know who was wrong we don't know if it was the golf driver who made the mistake we don't know if a dog didn't run across the road and caused this thing but what was interesting is it showed up a belief system that most of us don't even know we have it's a bias against the rich it's fascinating now in a room like this we are all studying and working toward building careers building futures becoming high net-worth individuals let me ask you a question do you reckon you can become a high net worth individual at the same time as hating wealthy people it's a self-limiting belief and it actually gets in the way but what's fascinating is that the kind of thinking that is handed down to us from generation to generation is invisible it was once beautiful wasn't it and I'm not the only person who's actually seen this in motion anybody here watch Top Gear yes yeah absolutely Top Gear fans join me for a moment here the rest of you can just go to sleep Jeremy Clarkson says in the United States you watch a person drive by in a Bentley and the reaction is one day I'll be in one of those and he says it's different in Britain he says in Britain you watch a guy drive past in the Bentley and you say one day I'll have him out of that that's a bit more sinister isn't it a little bit darker and it's really interesting because particularly in South Africa we have spent decades trying to unravel a belief system about racism that's been handed down from generation to generation but we are not aware of other beliefs that are handed down to us particularly beliefs about wealthy people and here we all are chasing these goals and chasing these lives while at the same time feeling uncomfortable about talking about money or talking about wealthy people as though they are obviously evil they come from the devil let's take a look at how this thinking is created how its generated how its handed down from generation to generation and how it can stop you from achieving your goals the point is to unravel it get it out of our minds X I sit be rid of it be free of it so that we can actually chase the goals that we have in life and become all God intended us to be in my family if you go back two generations to my grandmother she used to work at an English manor house in Manchester is anyone here ever watched the show on TV quite a quite amateur show called Downton Abbey anyone seen it no okay the basic idea is you've got two sets of people you've got the higher class folks who own this Abbey they're kind of semi royalty in the in the United Kingdom then you've got the people downstairs who run everything they do the cooking they do the sweeping the cleaning it's the the staff my grandmother was part of the manor house but she was not the people upstairs she was the people downstairs she was one of the maid servants who helped to keep this manor house clean and if you have to see pictures of the way that they dressed at the time it was the full old-style regalia she had the little apron and the little maids outfit and the little feather duster and it's everything we think of a slightly kinky today but of course at the time it was nothing like that this was a woman who worked incredibly hard from dusk till dawn this was a woman whose back was sawed more often than not this was a woman who if you ever met her and put your hands on her hands you'd find nothing but calluses and most importantly this was a woman who had no voice in the face of authority because the thinking back then for both the lower classes and for women was keep quiet don't make waves be a cog in the system we don't want to know that you exist we just want to see that your job gets done and this is the kind of thinking that is then handed down from generation to generation and what's interesting is that when my dad came along my grandmother was looking for the best advice she could possibly give to him about work and wealth and how to make your way in the world she went rummaging around in her mind and she came up with this Jim and it was the advice she gave to my dad she said my son get a trade that way you will never starve to death who here has heard some variation of that advice yeah yeah a lot of us have heard things down those lines there's nothing wrong with getting a trade you can become a plumber and you can become very wealthy as a plumber but listen to the second half of that sentence did she say so that you can become all god intends you to be is it so that you can let your light shine so that you can become wealthy so that you can achieve goals no it's so that you never starve to death the thinking comes from a place of desperation and that's the thinking that's handed down generation to generation and the weird part is it's completely invisible to us we hear this advice and we think it's right and we think it's normal now I'm not picking on my grandmother she was doing the best she could with the ideas that she had without perhaps knowing how much damage it can do to future generations take a look at the building you see behind me there that is an Industrial Revolution era factory it's about a hundred maybe 120 years ago what other building that we have today looks very similar to that factory out loud what do you think  hospitals what else schools schools yeah schools and here's an interesting one r-run according to the Industrial Revolution age of thinking picture this for a second you drop your kids off at school or you as a child or dropped off at school and you line up in neat lines and the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle or rings the bell and in your neat lines you go to your workstation and you sit down you sit down at your little workstation and you work for a number of hours and then the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle rings the bell and you take out your little lunch box and you can have some food then the whistle goes again you go back into your work station you sit down it is run according to an industrial revolution era Factory why because we are training human beings to be cogs in a system and we're still doing it hey now I'm not picking on schools here the point is not to say that schools are badly run the point is just to say we have thinking that is invisible to us we are trained to thought and we are culture alized to act in certain ways that no longer make sense in the modern economy the old world thinking says become a cog in a system fit in don't make waves and if you're a perfect cog you'll get you a little bit of money at the end of the day and you can go home that thinking will keep you poor so what are some of the alternatives well that's what I'd like to look at with you here today I like to call that style of thinking the wheelbarrow way it basically goes like this it's like the parents get hold of their child the young son the young daughter they say my son my daughter you are young and strong you must go out into the world and earn coins here's how you do it pick up your wheelbarrow load it full of bricks and for every hour that you push your wheelbarrow you will get one coin if you want a second coin you have to push your wheelbarrow for a second hour now we think like that we go the only way to earn coins is to work for a set number of hours so let me go and get a job and be dead on a boss now you work your set number of hours every day you push your wheelbarrow for your set number of hours and a horrible thing starts to happen you start to realize that you can't quite afford the car you're not quite breaking even with the kids and their education and the debit orders and the bonds and so on so what do you do you go back to the thinking that was handed down to you and you say if I'm not getting enough coins what do I have to do I have to push a second wheelbarrow in the evenings to get more coins that kind of thinking keeps families in generational cycles of poverty if you take nothing else away from today this is the one principle that is the most important do not tie your earning to the number of hours you work you've got to separate those two and I'll show you how today but so long as we think a number of hours equals a number of coins we are in financial trouble because as a human being you only have so many hours in the day the wealthy person's epiphany the way of breaking out of this idea is this dump the bricks in your wheelbarrow get rid of them load your wheelbarrow up with gold in other words for every hour that you push that wheelbarrow you need to raise the value of your work earn more coins per hour not work more hours in order to get more coins so that make sense okay of course that raises some interesting questions are how the heck do you do that there are definitely ways of doing it what are some of the things that our families teach us about work and about wealth and about how economies work and once again it's not to say that they are trying to do damage in our lives they are doing the best they can with the thinking handed down to them but the world has changed what are some of the things that they teach us work hard there's nothing wrong with working hard I believe in working hard but the goal is actually to make money not to work hard and there is a very big difference there in certain companies people think you are fantastic if you are working hard not necessarily if you are being effective so what they do is people make a show of the number of hours that they work how they work over weekend how they part of every meeting they're not necessarily getting stuff done but they're showing that they're working hard yeah that's the difference the next thing is play it safe play it safe wealthy people take risks all the time the middle classes and poor folks take no risks at all in fact I heard a phrase the other day that's just been resonating in my mind that says the middle classes are paralyzed by doubt they are secure to the point of paralysis they do not take risks and of course the thinking handed down there is get a safe job and let someone else take care of you be like everyone else here's an obvious thing that has to be said if you be like everyone else you're gonna earn like everyone else if you choose the safe route in life you are choosing to earn less than you potentially could so today let's talk about the idea of recession versus abundance you've probably heard I mean it's all over the world news and it's in every newspaper every blog everywhere you go the recession that we've been talking about that kicked in in 2008 what's interesting about recessions is not what's going on in the world what's going on in your Innerspace up here there are for example speakers in my industry who have decided that there is a recession and have earned a heck of a lot less as a result then there are other speakers was a gibe particular guy in the states named randy gage who said in 2008 the world issued an invitation to go into recession and I politely declined and he says he's had his best year ever every single year since then because what happens is when we are told that there is a recession we stop acting in ways that generate money because we believe that people aren't buying we haven't discovered a recession we have bought into the concept of a recession there are certain companies who have had their best years ever since right the way through this recession because they simply don't believe in it today I'd like to share with you a tip eight ideas eight ways of overhauling your thinking that have to do with work and wealth and my promise to you is that they are going to be uncomfortable I hear to make people feel good but this stuff is massively important it's important because we are still being taught the ways to work that are outdated the world changes but we're still practicing the old ways if you do do the Twitter thing you're more than welcome to tweet about it as you go along I see a couple of people grabbing their phones when you see the eight yeah if you want to connect with me on Twitter use at Douglas Kruger yeah you can say this guy is talking a load of rubbish or this is a valuable idea whatever but I warn you I'm going to close the doors and check every tweet before I let you out I will find you epiphany number one resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy there's a phrase that my family always used to use and when I was young we struggled really really badly with poverty we had some incredibly rough winters one that I remember we went through the whole of July with our power cut off we had our local church bringing food baskets to our house and I lived in a pretty decent neighborhood and we were the odd ones out so it's quite rough to go through that sort of thing and to have someone else feeding your family when your own parents can't it was a difficult time to go through but what's most interesting to me now looking back on that time period is the kind of language that my family used around the dinner table has your family ever used a phrase like how the other half live when they talk about rich people yeah you know what it's like it's like rich people are a different species the way that I'd like you to look at the difference between where you are and wealth is I want you to look at it as a curve because if it is a curve you can move along that curve you can go from where you are now to your goals but if you buy into that thinking that says rich people are just a different species then instead of a curve there's just a chasm there's a hole there is an absolute void between where you are and where you to be and if you don't believe that it's possible to move along that transition you don't act in ways that start to move you there the first the starting point in becoming a high net worth individual is the belief that it is possible that a wealthy person is not a different species they're just further along on a continuum they have more education about what brings in money and how to achieve goals than what you currently have and that's okay because that represents hope that means you can learn these things you can do them resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy we often think about wealthy people as they're obviously evil they're obviously corrupt they obviously stepped on people's faces to get where they are now Forbes magazine paints a different picture of that they take the highest-earning individuals on the planet and they look at how much they give the stats bear out that wealthy people give more per capita than anyone else we're not just talking about more money because they actually have more we're talking about more per individual in percentage form the idea that wealth people are wealthy people are obviously stingy obviously evil is not borne out by statistics yeah of course there's obviously the odd jerk you will meet the odd horrible rich person they're out there certainly in their numbers but by and large it is not a valid rule that's number one number two there are three things that money is not money is not the root of all evil that's not what the verse says what does the verse say the love of money and it also doesn't say is the root of all evil it says something down the lines of is the root of many kinds of evil now think about what that belief would do to Christian families people of faith if it becomes a locked-in belief and it's handed down generation to generation money is the root of all evil okay so if I chase it there's something wrong with me you can't hold that belief and become wealthy the two do not work together and that's one of those things that we need to check out it's a misquote of the original verse and it's damaging it does a lot of harm particularly to people of faith money is the first thing money is not the root of all evil the second thing money is not embarrassing could you be rich with a straight face time to face that question because you are on a career trajectory that can potentially make you very wealthy could you handle it what kind of human being would you be once you get there yeah wealth simply makes you an amplified version of yourself so what are you if you're a horrible person a rich version of you is going to be a horrible person who's able to do more if you're a good person who likes to help others a rich version of you will be an amplified version of that their money is not embarrassing and if we are embarrassed by money it changes a number of things around the dinner table as a family we won't talk about it no no the middle classes like to talk about how hard we're working but we never talked about how to earn money or how to lose money all of the rules of money you get into the home of wealthy people and that's what they talk to their children about because they think it's important money is not embarrassing we must talk about it and number three you'll see that little pool on the screen their money is not finite it is not finite it is not a limited resource if I take some over here there's less for you money doesn't work that way I have a friend who studied to be a doctor she actually qualified no in fact forgive me I got that one wrong she is a qualified lawyer passed her bar exam and what she then did because she was married to a guy who is quite wealthy she said I'm not going to practice law because if I practice law I get a salary and that means slightly less money for other people folks the thinking is wrong she has the world's best intentions there but what she's actually doing is failing to contribute a little bit to the total amount of money available work doesn't take money out of a system it adds it to it the more people we have running their own businesses the more people we have selling the more people we have doing stuff the more there is for all bring your skill to this country bring your talent earn money for yourself the more you have the more there is in totality it's also very interesting because in different countries they think about the finite nature of money in different ways Korea about 10 20 years ago they decided that they wanted to do economic upliftment for the majority of their people so what did they do they took a look at America and they said I reckon we contact we can take on their car industry and we can take on their IT industry have you ever heard of Samsung yeah have you ever heard of any of the Korean car brands yeah Hyundai and what's the other one Kia and they are absolutely conquering the world right now because what they've decided to do is to grow now other countries around the world and in fact South Africa is a prime example we go oh there's a finite amount of money so if we want to make some people rich what are we going to do if we're going to take from others rather than growing the entire pool bring your skill grow the country we need entrepreneurs we often talk about how much we need jobs you can't falsely create a job my next question to you is why the heck would you want a job you can't get wealthy in a job but that's what we're taught as middle-class people we're taught be like everyone else get a good safe job ok we'll talk about that one in just a moment as well number three represent yourself represent yourself there's a fantastic book and when I'm king of the world I'm going to make it mandatory reading for everyone it's called outliers by Malcolm Gladwell anyone here read that yeah I highly recommended Malcolm Gladwell outliers he talks about the difference between people who fail and succeed in anything and he talks about how in wealthy families they teach their children something very different to what is taught in middle class and poorer families and it's just how to interact with Authority the middle classes and poorer people are taught to fear Authority and it's industrial revolution thinking you've got to fear the guy who runs the factory because he owns your life yeah and it goes like this let's take a practical example they do this one in the book he says you're taking your child to the dentist the middle-class family will teach the child that the dentist is God he has studied for eight years and he knows everything there is to know you as the child must shut up sit down keep quiet and even if it hurts don't cry just wait for it to be over do whatever he tells you to do now in wealthy families they approach the exact same situation completely differently driving to the dentist's office they tell the child the dentist is your friend he has studied for eight years so that he can serve you properly how's that Hey the dentist is a resource that you can use if you have any questions about your mouth about your teeth about anything that you want to know there you must ask the dentist because it's his job to help you now take that kind of thinking that's a simple example going to the dentist take that kind of thinking and amplify it over the next 20 years which of those two kids is going to do well in life you've got one who's taught to fear Authority shut up keep your voice down don't make waves and the other one who's taught the world is there for you to utilize it's all resources you can use it to your own ends imagine the difference that that would make represent yourself and we need to teach our children to represent themselves as well we have been conned into an industrial revolution myth that says authorities in charge and knows best you must shut up and do what you're told you must be a cog in a system and as long as you are doing your job perfectly and not making waves you'll be fine that thinking is a hundred years outdated we cannot teach it any longer number three number four inspired ideas this is one of my favorites as you go about building your career there are the things that you need to do on a day to day basis that slowly gradually move you up that curve toward wealth and if you keep doing them slowly and consistently and gradually every single day ultimately your life is going to improve and you must do those things however from time to time we get that one inspired idea that crazy thought that thing that pops into our heads are we go what if and it's those ideas which in one go can add an extra zero to your income you must have them you must act on them I'll give you a simple practical example in 2006 I had a book published on public speaking and it went through a traditional publisher in Cape Town it went into the bookstores and sold for about a hundred and fifty R and a book of which I got a trans 75 that's how much the author actually gets still I was really chuffed to have this book published and it's a bit of credibility for me as a speaker and it did bring in some money now one of my professional speaker friends said Doug don't do it that way the next time you write a book publish it yourself you pay for the printing you pay for everything and sure it's a bit of money up front but after that you can sell the book at a complete profit and I had this inspired idea I thought wait a minute what if you took that one step further what if you got somebody else to pay for the book so I literally walked in the front door of one of my biggest clients old mutual fair Bain Capital and I spoke to one of the directors and I said how do you feel about giving me a hundred and fifty thousand Rand two minutes later after he'd said yes we were discussing his next yachting holiday I took the chance I tried and it worked he paid for a thousand copies of two separate books and I've been selling them ever since no money down every book that I sell is pure profit margin hey you're starting to see how like thinking differently means different levels of income you can get a salary at the end of the month or you can do things for yourself and generate your own income with inspired ideas now that's just a small one but that brought in firstly it meant I didn't have to pay a hundred and fifty thousand rand and then beyond that it meant something like three four four five hundred thousand rands worth of book sales over the years and that's just one small thing that made a massive impact on my life but I had to represent myself I had to have the idea I had to walk through the door and just have the gumption to try to ask to not be a cog in a system that just does its function perfectly to be a human being with a face and a voice and thoughts creative ideas and an opinion and that can change the scale of your income that's number four number five number five is an abstract idea leaving the ranks of the poor may mean leaving the ranks of the poor that makes sense get will in a moment a while ago I was driving past a particularly poor area it was one of these places where on the side of the road you see these dogs with the sort of ribs sticking out and I mean it's all dust and poverty and hardship and you know I look at that sort of thing in it it saddens me that human beings still have to live under conditions like that here you think about it as a species we're at the level where we're each of us I mean how many people around the room are holding personal computers in their own hands in the form of an own or an iPad or whatever the case might be we have that kind of technology we send satellites out into space we are able to take a photograph of Earth from millions of miles away and then send it back through the void and look at that picture we have astonishing levels of achievement and yet we still have families who don't have enough to eat every day that's awful now dry I happen to be on my way to a conference where I was speaking about an entrepreneurial idea how to make money and I thought to myself just a mental exercise if I was stripped of all of the stuff that I use every day the suit the car the equipment the bits and pieces there the toys if I was stripped of all of that and just left with my knowledge my wits and my education and put into this scenario living in abject poverty could I get back out could I get back out and back to my own life what do you think and could you yeah okay most of the people around this room are kind of saying yes now that's an interesting thought let's take that thought one step further if I had to take a high net worth individual someone who does Drive the Ferrari the Lamborghini someone with their own private helicopter with their own business whatever the case might be and I transplanted them into your life do you think they would be able to get back out if we say yes to that then what we're saying is the gap between where you are and where that person is is up here and then a horrifying thought but at the same time it represents hope because it means it can be done it means that the thought is out there the ideas are out there the knowledge the education is available it can be done leaving the ranks of the poor however may mean leaving the ranks of the poor my thought process went like this I thought maybe I'd start up a small company something that doesn't doesn't require a lot of startup capital maybe a little store maybe I'd get other people to work for me and then I kind of stopped enough so I thought to myself that's not what I do the first thing I do is to physically leave and go somewhere else why because often in situations like that the thinking is depressed and it's not it's not to point fingers or to point blame I mean I've been in a family that has gone through extreme poverty but when you've had generations of poverty it's almost impossible to believe it's possible the thinking becomes depressed there's a speaker in the States these days who has an interesting concept and I believe it he says you are likely to be about as wealthy and about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you think about that for a second who are your closest five it's likely to be probably something like mom dad best friend boss teacher something down those lines chances are it's those people how wealthy are they I'm sorry to ask the question but apparently those stats bear out because what happens is we get involved in an ecosystem of thinking and we all affect one another with our level of aspiration a level of ideas our thinking about work and wealth and we all Everage each other out there's something you can do about this one you don't have to dump your mom okay you don't have to dump the best friend anything down those lines what it is saying is we do need to associate with highly successful individuals we need to expose ourselves to that kind of thinking unless we do we are not going to lift ourselves up but the thinking is out there and quite often people are quite willing to be mentors friends to share answers share ideas sometimes they're not it's always worth asking worth the approach you are likely to be about as wealthy or about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you here's an uncomfortable question is your state's thinking keeping you put can you think of one policy just one then we have in this country that tries to help people but actually promotes poverty anyone social grants yeah think about it this way around what a great idea you've got a young mom who falls pregnant has a couple of kids she's on her own she has no way of earning an income so what we do we give us some money brilliant idea except then of course the opposite happens you have a young woman who goes you know what I'd like some money some money so I'm going to become a young mom in order to get it there is that likely to help them to become incredibly prosperous no is your state's thinking keeping you poor number six your positioning determines your pay scale it is not the quality of your work that determines your income you can be the best in the world at a certain thing and be out earned by someone who is not the best in the world your positioning determines your pay scale let's put this in very simple terms if you're the celebrity of your industry you're going to out-earn the non celebrity of your industry even if that guy's better at it than you let's take for example anyone here watch the cooking show with Nigella Lawson seen her on TV yeah yeah absolutely Nigella Lawson do you reckon she is one of the top five chefs in the world no I don't think so do you think she's in the top hundred mmm I don't think so do you reckon she's in the top thousand I don't think so so why is she out earning all of them because she's Nigella Lawson I'll give you another example if an unknown speaker comes and stands in front of you that person can put in an invoice fourth X number of zeros at the end of an hour of speaking Richard Branson walks into the room and chats with you for five minutes they will add three more zeros to his fee it's not because he worked harder and it's not because he's a better speaker it's because he's Richard Branson you need to be the icon the expert the celebrity the big name in your industry now here's where most people get it wrong they say knowledge is everything knowledge is important but you also have to bring personality that's what Nigella Lawson is doing she is able to speak well in front of a camera she's pretty she's seductive yeah now this is all the stuff that we are never taught as important we are taught what's important is be a cog in a system don't make waves function perfectly get your job done imagine if Nigella Lawson did that she'd be poor all she'd ever do is cook in the kitchen maybe earn like five bucks once in a while yeah but because she brings humanity to it she brings to it things that cannot be done by a computer that cannot be done by a system anything that can be systematized computerised commoditized is unvalued all we're still teaching our kids to study IT that's a low income future because there's like two billion other people studying IT and most of it will be done by the computer itself like tomorrow that's how fast it's moving there's at one of those talks on Ted the inspirational talks website where a guy says and this is quite interesting he says the economy of tomorrow will not be ruled by people who have doctorates or who have studied IT or anything technical the economy of tomorrow will be ruled by people who did bas and know how to think creatively because the computer can't do that it's the people who bring their personality their humanity you become an icon in their industry so it's not just about how good you are technically at what you do it's about being the human being to face the voice the one we see in the media in magazines hear on the radio are you an icon that way you earn more number seven this one's more for companies but it's useful to us as well don't fixate on the bottom line what most companies tend to do is when they think about their finances they put 80 percent of their energy into saving what they have and 20 percent of their energy into earning more we need to reverse that saving of course is important yes you can save yourself rich if you've got like 150 years to live what's more important is actually generating more income picture a clan of people now I want you to just use your imaginations here let's go back thousands of years in time we're sitting at the outskirts of our cave we are a plan and we're facing winter winter is like recession winter is trying winter is deadly to us and our economy is made up of Buffalo we eat them to survive we wear their coats in order to survive this horrific winter the hunters have been out into the field and good news they came back with three Buffalo but three Buffalo is not quite enough for our entire clan to make it through the winter we technically need more now the thinking in the clan splits in two we get the hunters and we get the bean-counter in the cave and the bean-counter says what we have to do is take those three Buffalo and conserve them preserve them make them last save them so that we get through the winter the hunters see it differently they say no no give us one of the Buffalo to eat and using that strength we will go back out into the field and we will get more Buffalo so that we can make it through the winter all big organizations have this split between the bean-counter and the Buffalo and sometimes it destroys entire companies yeah my belief system says this it doesn't matter how well you save your Buffalo if you don't have enough Buffalo saving effectively is only going to mean you'll starve to death slower you need more Buffalo in the system in other words you need to put 20 percent of your energy into saving your money and 80 percent of your energy into generating more money that's the way we need to think saving is important but it's not all important middle-class thinking says the most important thing to do is save sure if you're going to live for 150 years brilliant idea number eight Randy gage the u.s. speaker recently wrote a book called risky is the new safe the alternative applies safe is the new risky we've been taught for generations to play it safe you get a job and don't make waves I contend that that is the most dangerous thing that you can possibly do because you are taking all of your eggs and putting them in one basket you are taking your life your future your career your spouse your children your medical aids your debit orders your entire life putting them into one basket and handing them to a person whose first concern is not your welfare that sounds pretty dangerous to me also 6070 years ago people did go and get a job and work for 4050 years and retire safely does that happen anymore heck no it's just not the reality most companies these days if you've got a job you have 31 days of safety that's it now let's look at this differently people say being an entrepreneur is risky being your own boss is risky well Forbes magazine says the only people who are wealthy are their own bosses okay the next thing is if you as an entrepreneur try 10 big crazy inspired ideas and eight of them fail you've got two of them working now you go out there and you try another ten big crazy inspired ideas and again eight of them fail two of them work now you're up to four things that are bringing in income you go out there ten big things eight fail two more you're up to six different things that are bringing in income for myself as a speaker I now have multiple income streams I speak I train I sell books I sell DVDs I do media appearances multiple streams of income much much safer risky is the new safe safe is the new risky and the more we buy into the old Industrial Revolution era idea that having a boss take care of us is safe the greater the danger we put our own lives in risky is the new safe safe is the new risky I believe that risk aversion is one of the things that paralyzes most of the people in the middle class your average high net worth individual has been bankrupt three times how scary is the idea of going bankrupt to you yeah to them it's a matter of course they've tried big crazy things they've tried building up businesses and they've uh Turley utterly failed but to them it's only part of the process and they do something interesting and I'd like to invite you to do this they give themselves permission to fail folks today at this early stage in your career make that commitment to yourself do yourself a favor give yourself permission to fail it's okay it's only a bit of embarrassment so any bit of skin off the knees it's only picking yourself up and trying again they think differently in California to what we think here the guy here started and started up a business and failed banks won't touch him with a bargepole in California the banks and the financier seek out the people who have tried and failed before because they reckon that person has learnt valuable lessons along the way give yourself permission to fail here's a revolutionary thought give other people permission to laugh at you and mock you for trying let that be okay say I know my family's not going to understand I know my friends are going to laugh at me they're going to tell me this is crazy you should play it safe and get a job give them permission to think that way give them permission to laugh at you give yourself permission to try and fail you need the space you need the leeway be kind to yourself my final parting thought for today is just this you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you are separated from your goals by a number of actions and that's completely different years years are an abstract concept that's like saying 1020 years from now I'll be wealthy it's not up to years it's up to you and your actions that puts the ball back in your hand that gives you control that gives you the power you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you're separated from your goals by a number of actions the word is as a man thinks so is he so ladies and gentlemen know to think for may god bless you and may you prosper", "A6Dkt7zyImk": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs Reviewer: Tanya Cushman What if I told you that breakfast being the most important meal of the day was wrong? (Laughter) What if I told you it is more important when you eat than what you eat? Perhaps much of the nutritional dogma that we've been raised with is now outdated, like snacking all day long and eating many meals. Over the next few minutes, I plan to discuss with you what I believe to be the most profoundly transformational concept and strategy as it pertains to health and aging. Over the last 20 years, as a nurse practitioner and a functional nutritionist, I've seen tremendous shifts, tremendous shifts in health and wellness: escalating rates of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease - many of which are preventable. The choices we make in terms of nutrition are profoundly impactful on our health, more than most of us realize. During my training as a nurse practitioner many years ago, the dominant nutritional paradigm was exercise more, eat less. I've found this to be profoundly ineffective for most, if not all, of my female patients. The concept of \"calories-in, calories-out\" alone is just not effective. Many of the things that I work with, with my female patients really focus on the connection between our lifestyle choices and how that impacts healthy aging and weight gain. I do not believe, nor do I support, the limiting belief that women have to accept weight gain as a normal function of aging. The National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey, which looks at data with regard to children and adults in terms of their nutrition and escalating obesity rates, compares what went on in the 1970s, where most Americans consumed three meals a day and no snacks; fast forward to today, most of what we are doing as Americans is eating three meals a day and snacking all day long. Really. And so one of the things that starts to happen when healthcare providers are telling our patients that we need to eat all day long - it's wrong. Eating all day long overtaxes our pancreas and our digestive system. It overtaxes it so much that it cannot work properly. And if it cannot work properly, we cannot absorb our food or the nutrients in that food. Another really important distinction when it comes to meal frequency, or how frequently we're eating, is the debate over sugar burners versus fat burners. And when we're talking about that, a sugar burner is someone that consumes lots of carbohydrates and taps into glucose as their primary fuel source, which is incredibly inefficient. If you recognize these individuals: They are frequently hungry. They often get hangry. They have - yes - significant dips in their energy level. They struggle more with fat loss, and they struggle more with their weight because insulin levels are high. Insulin is that fat-storing hormone. So if levels remain high, we have more oxidative stress; we have more inflammation; and we struggle more with weight gain. In sharp contrast to this are fat burners. They tap into fat stores for energy; they have sustained energy; they are much more clear cognitively; they don't get hangry; it's easier for them to lose weight because they tap into those fat stores; they sleep better; and they age more slowly. So meal timing and how frequently we are eating - it's absolutely crucial. Absolutely crucial. Let's talk about some statistics as they pertain to women and healthy aging. So we know two-thirds of women 40-50 years of age are overweight, and more than half are obese. How do we proactively address this statistic without quick fixes? It makes me want to cry when my female patients would prefer I write them a prescription than work on changing their diet, more exercise, other lifestyle changes. Women in their 50s and 60s gain an average of 1.5 pounds per year. Per year. That's average. And some of this is attributable to things like hormonal fluctuations, women having less lean muscle mass than their male counterparts, sleep disturbances and mood disorders. However, there are strategies we can use to help offset this. So folks, I want you to save your money on potions and powders and supplements that are not long-term solutions. I've got a better idea. And I'm going to tell you about it. I've got a better idea. There are lots of strategies that I use with my female patients, but none more powerful than intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting can help fuel fat loss as well as many other benefits that I'll talk more about in a second. But it also can improve interpersonal relationships and self-esteem. And for many women, this permits them - it's the magic bullet that allows them to gain back their former selves. Really powerful. And the really cool thing about intermittent fasting is it's free, it's flexible and it's simple. You take nothing else away. Free. Flexible. Simple. So let's talk about intermittent fasting. It is the absence of food during a prescribed time period. You exist either in a fed or a fasted state. I'm sure for many of you, you had breakfast this morning. So when you eat, insulin is secreted by the pancreas to move sugar into the cells. We store the bulk of our sugar in our liver and our skeletal muscle. But when we exceed those storage sites, we store it as fat. When we're fasted, insulin levels are low and we can tap into fat stores for energy. Free. Flexible. Simple. And so, when we're talking about intermittent fasting, it's fairly simple. If you skip breakfast - If you skip breakfast in the morning, you can reduce your caloric intake by 20 to 40 percent. And the typical time frame that I recommend to my female patients is a 16:8. Sixteen hours a day fasted with an eight-hour feeding window. I know that seems a little overwhelming at first, but I'll give you some strategies for how you go about doing that. So, the 20-40 percent reduction in calories means that you can fuel fat loss. So what are some of the benefits other than fat loss - fat loss and especially visceral fat around our abdomens, around our major organs? We know that it improves mental clarity because insulin levels are low. We know that it spikes human growth hormone, which helps us with lean muscle mass. We know that it induces something called autophagy - I will speak more about this in a second. But this is spring cleaning for the cells. It is only evoked when we are fasted. Autophagy. We know that it lowers insulin levels, blood pressure, improves our cholesterol profile. And we know that it can reduce your risk for developing cancer and Alzheimer's disease, which I like to call type 3 diabetes. If, for no other reason, we want to protect our brains. As wonderful a strategy as this is, it is not for everyone. I'm going to talk briefly about the individuals that want to avoid this strategy. First and foremost, if you are a brittle diabetic, or you have difficult-to-control diabetes; if you are a child, an adolescent or age greater than 70 - might not be the best strategy; if you are pregnant; if you have chronic heart issues, kidney or renal issues - not the best strategy. If you have a history of a disordered relationship with food, whether it is anorexia, bulimia or binge eating - might not be the best strategy because it can invoke those tendencies. And last but not least, if you have a low body mass index, you're frail or you've recently been in the hospital like I was for 13 days. I'm not currently intermittent fasting. Now, everyone always asks, Well, when you're fasting, we know we're not eating food, but you can absolutely consume things like filtered water, plain coffee or tea. They will not break your fast. But when you're ready to eat, what do you eat? Now, I would be remiss if I did not mention that there are foods that are going to be more advantageous for you to consume when you're ready to break your fast. So I want you to focus on real whole foods. That's what your body needs, wants and deserves. So I want you to purchase the best quality protein that your budget permits. Ideally, organic or pastured meat, wild-caught fish. Healthy fats - so crucial - helpful for building healthy hormones and also really important for satiety - making sure our taste buds light up, make us happy. I'm not part of the anti-fat brigade. Really, really important. Twenty years ago, I might have told you not to eat fat, but now we know better. So I want you to focus on things like avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed butter and nuts - really great, healthy fats. Unprocessed carbohydrates. Ladies, absolutely crucial, if you're in perimenopause, the five to seven years before menopause, or you're in menopause, quality and quantity are crucial. So I want you to consume things like low-glycemic berries, green leafy vegetables, squash, quinoa, sweet potatoes as opposed to bread and pasta. Cautionary tale: I want you to limit sugar and alcohol. By that I mean, I want you to not consume those things because they can offset all the good that you're doing. And lastly, keep yourself well hydrated. Now, I want to make sure that I briefly touch on some of the practical implications for how you would go about starting intermittent fasting. Generally, I have my ladies start with 12-13 hours of fasted period. And they can slowly increase by an hour or so every day until they've reached that 16 hour mark. Again, you want to keep yourself really well hydrated. You can also have plain coffee or tea. In addition to that, you want to ensure that you give it a solid 30 days before you determine if it's the right strategy for you. And if you have chronic health conditions, I want to make sure you discuss it with your healthcare provider. Really important. And recognize it may take six to eight weeks to really see the full benefits of what you're doing. The biggest pain point for my female patients is weight gain. I have a fantastic strategy to help with this, but I don't want you to buy into the next $50 container of protein powder or the hottest weight loss supplement that's out there. I want you to think about the fact this is a simple, flexible and free option that you can try at home, discuss with your healthcare provider if necessary. I really feel so passionately about this because it's something that all of us should be discussing with our patients. Thank you.

thanks for watching subscribe for more", "9iE-fpyiK2g": "hi I'm mark McHugh leader with live anabolic comm and if you're over fifty like me you need to watch this video because I'm going to give you three great exercises that are gonna help you get rid of that stubborn belly fat and also stick around at the end of the video because I'm gonna give you another tip that's gonna help actually help you supercharge this process and guys if you don't follow that tip at the end of this video you're gonna be incredibly frustrated because nothing you do no matter how hard you work out it's not gonna work you're not gonna lose that belly fat all right so let's start off with tip number one it's simple gas it's called a sprinting now I don't want you all to go out onto a track and just sprint as far as you can in a straight line you're gonna pull a muscle a hamstring let me tell you I would so these are three exercises that you can do in the comfort of your own home no special equipment and when I'm talking about sprinting I'm talking about something called anabolic Spring okay sometimes I refer to it as anabolic cardio sometimes you'll hear me talk about something called hit which is high-intensity interval training very similar concept so guys there are tons of studies out there that talk about how great sprinting is for our hormone system that's the key guys it really does supercharge our hormones and it increases our testosterone production so guess what that does that literally makes your body more efficient at using fat for energy and having more testosterone literally makes it easier to build muscle okay so another thing is that sprinting also creates something called EPOC that's EPOC and that stands for excess post-exercise oxygen consumption so why don't we care about that well it creates something called an after burn effect basically what it does is after we stop our sprinting exercises our high intensity exercises your body actually maintains a than normal metabolism for hours and hours and hours after the workouts already done so if you're doing traditional workouts traditional steady-state cardio you're not going to get that epoch or that afterburn effect but sprinting anabolic cardio actually creates that and so guys it means that you're going to be burning more calories throughout the day while you're just going about your normal business whether you're sitting in front of the computer or driving a car or watching TV because you got that excess post-exercise post-exercise oxygen consumption going on okay so exercise number one sprinting guys it's a little different I don't want you jog it in place like this okay and I don't want you doing high knees like this I want you to be actually doing full-on 100% sprinting as hard as you can but only do it for twenty or thirty seconds so real short time sprint sprint as hard as you can stop catch your breath do it over for several cycles all right I'm gonna change the camera angle so you can get guys can see exactly what I'm talking about all right this is what I'm talking about when I say all-out 100% sprinting in place and I'm talking about it these finite as fast as you can go pumping those arms okay I cannot go any faster than this okay 100% twenty to thirty seconds give yourself about a minute or two break do it all over again whoa three more times I want four cycles alright let's move on to exercise number two and that is mountain climbers now mountain climbers are absolutely fantastic you don't need any room to do I mean just do them in your den and then in addition to really get your heart rate up like the springing in place does mountain climbers also engage our core and our abs and it strengthens our entire midsection so not only do we get the stronger better tighter looking abs but mountain climbers also trigger that same EPOC effect or afterburn effect so it's gonna raise our metabolism for hours and hours and hours after we've already finished doing the exercise so guys another study done by the Mayo Clinic says this exact same thing that I've been talking about it says that for elderly people in beginners doing this kind of high-intensity interval training is a fantastic way to build muscle burn fat and improve your cardiovascular system so all along is like get down on the ground do some mountain climbers for you alright guys follow along see if you can copy the form that I'm doing on these mountain climbers and I'm going to show you two different ways to do them so for some of you beginners you could try the easy way if you're in better shape or if you just happen to be really good to stuff you can do the more difficult method alright so here we go we're gonna get in like we're doing a cushion okay and all I'm going to do is bring one leg knee up and I'm not going to touch the ground with my toe see how my toes just off the ground come back same thing on the other side my toe doesn't touch but my knee comes and you're just gonna do it real fast so we're just gonna be bouncing back and forth so you gotta kind of pop up on your feet and you're bouncing it so I'm bringing my knees up but my feet weren't touching the ground all right let's say that's too hard for you let me show you take number two so this is what you do you're in like a push-up position here and you're gonna hop and bring the left foot up and my foot is on the ground right now okay so I can hang like this for a while and then I'm just going to bounce and hop to the other side so my foots on the ground and I can just bounce back and forth doing mountain climbers with my feet on the ground so two different ways to do it guys pick the way it works best for you okay but once you get into better shape I want you to try to do it the way I showed you the first time where your feet don't actually touch the ground as you bring your knee up alright so just like this pretty in place same thing here guys this is basically doing mountain climbers in place 20 seconds as fast as you can go alright I don't have a stopwatch here so I'm just gonna guesstimate hi what do you think gasps can I do it here we go  it works guys trust me how long was that 20-30 seconds anyway I can feel the epoch kick it in now give yourself a couple minutes rest catch your breath once you do it again three more times but we need finish I've got to show you exercise number three all right guys the third and final exercise for today's video are called bicycle cross crunches now this is probably one of my favorite you know go-to exercises for our abs and our core and I really like it because it really does work all the muscles in our core and then like that got at least for me it's really easy on my back it doesn't put any strain my back don't put any strain on my neck so guys I love this exercise and another thing is it just burns a lot more calories than doing one of these static core exercises like planks and so you get that EPOC effect plus you're burning more calories great all-around exercise guys I'll follow along I'm gonna get down floor and show you exactly how to do this alright guys bye simple cross crunches this is the correct form just follow along it's really pretty straightforward it may feel awkward at first if you've never done this but I promise after you've done it a few times easy now remember I'm not grasping for my fingers behind my head here I'm just putting my fingers on the side of my head and I'm not trying to pull my head up to the world I'm not really cranking on the neck okay so my fingers are just lightly touching this side of my head here okay keep my knees up in the air the whole time and I'm just gonna slide this side bring my knee back and my elbow from the opposite side and try to touch it okay so bison will cross crunches and guys you can do them fast like this if you want for 20 to 30 seconds or you can slow it down either way it's fantastic you get a great burn in your abs your entire core man I'm feeling it and then you can speed it up all right by simple cross crunches last exercise give yourself a minute or two rest and catch your breath and let your abs just kind of recuperate and then do it all over again all right I'm glad you stuck around for this final tip because this really is critical guys if you don't follow what I'm about to tell you all those other three exercises are not gonna solve your problem of that ugly belly fat the tip is you have to eat at a caloric deficit and I don't mean just occasionally you need to eat at a caloric deficit on a day-in and day-out basis guys you can have a cheat day if you messed up on a day or two don't give up get back on your routine so what does the caloric deficit guys you have to make sure your bring more calories every day then you're consuming as simple as that the problem is calculating of those two numbers Bert the amount of calories you burn is pretty straightforward take your body weight in pounds multiplied by 15 and that is roughly what you burn on an average day you guys want to get more accurate you can go out and buy one of those watches these fit watches to track your heart rate throughout the day and the number of steps you take those watches or give you a more accurate representation how many calories you burn every day now the intake side how many calories did we take in when we eat this is how you do it you have to keep a diary for two days that's it I know it's a pain in the butt once you do it you'll understand and you'll know what your average daily intake is so right now everything you eat for two days and pick two average days okay and I mean write down everything and then at the end of those two days you know you're gonna puter there's a bunch of simple apps on your computer and look up how many calories are in all that food that you ate then you can calculate what your average daily intake is and you want the burn rate to be about 500 calories higher than your integrate Y because 500 calories a day is a really easy to get rid of okay that's not many calories you can easily cut 500 calories out of your diet on an average day and not feel hungry okay and then secondly 500 calories a day times seven days a week 3,500 calories a week so why is that cool guess what 3,500 calories equals one pound of fat so gasps if you can burn one pound of fat a week it doesn't sound like much but that is fantastic it's a great way to accomplish your goal and then keep that fat off so guys thanks for sticking around and really hope you appreciated the video and don't forget to subscribe to this channel post some comments below like it share with your buddies and remember always stick with it and don't give up on yourself", "rNChOX9HJlw": "Fuck. What time is it right now? Too early. It's almost 7. This will be year number eight at the CrossFit Games. Finished third twice and first last year. I would say really the one difference was that I wasn't injured. You'd be surprised at, in the years past, how little I trained leading up to the CrossFit Games. Sometimes, when my back was really bad, I trained one time a day on a bike, because that's about all I could do. Biking and push-ups or biking and strict pull-ups. Got another one. Got a whole 'nother lap. Nevermind. I have to pee. There was one minute. And then I just went out there and I competed like I was afraid to do anything in the gym because I would hurt myself. So I was really healthy going in, and I was mentally focused. A lot more hungry than I was in years past. I kind of feel like I switched to a different gear that I'm kind of sitting in now, and I just feel good going into this year again. It's just a different mindset. You guys all want to run this last one? One more? Hey, why one more? Make it an even 30. I was pretty nervous because we didn't know how many we were going to do going into it. DId you hear the guy on the run? He was like, \"Holy crap. You guys are big as crap,\" but he said the s-word instead of crap. Did you guys see that one guy that's running? Have you seen him? He's the legend of Oak Grove. He just keeps running. (singing) Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Ugh. I usually have, like, some idea of what I want to do, but I want to just focus on a lot more cardio and lungs today. 2014, I was full time in school at UVM. That summer I was working a summer internship at an aerospace company here in Vermont. Fuck. 2015, full-time student for one semester. I went part time for the other semester to focus more on CrossFit. 2016, just CrossFit. No, no, I do not have an addiction to suffering. I have an addiction to what the product of suffering is. The same way as anything I do in life. When I was in school, I would literally sit in the library for 10 hours on Saturday. I would read the textbook cover to cover. When I'd finish a chapter, if I couldn't tell you every single law that was in there, or every single formula, I would go back and read it again. That's not because I was addicted to reading the textbook. It's because I was addicted to the day that we got our exams and the exam wasn't challenging. That's the feeling I chase. Getting your test score back and you got the highest grade in the class. That's a good feeling. When I'm downstairs by myself and no one else around, no one else is watching, that's when the work gets put in. I don't love doing rowing intervals or max-out squats. That shit hurts. But the day you show up to exams, and you put up a top time, that's the feeling I chase. Coffee with Progenex and some coconut oil. We'll go to a burger place for lunch. That'll be my first meal probably. I'm just not too hungry after that run. Come on, let's go. You're supposed to go outside. I love coaching. It's like, that's why I started the gym. I wanted to help people. People come in, and they have this goal they want to achieve, and if you can help them in any way, or you can assist them in any way, that's awesome.. I mean, that's something that--everybody should strive to help others The CrossFit gym gave me a great opportunity to do that, and that's all you gotta do, is care about every single person that walks in the door like they're your best friend. That's a little long, so shorten that up a little bit. That's ok. You're getting it. That's why we practice, right? Nice job. They end up being your best friends. It's awesome. It's just what I love to do. It's a lot of fun. Yeah, Ben's a great coach. We have a very small gym and we had like 20 people in that class. I mean, it's--you know, and I think at some point during the class he addressed a few things with everybody, and, you know, to everybody individually. As you dip, keeping those elbows up, alright? Because they're wanting to drop a little bit. If you can motivate or inspire one person, you can change their life. That's what it's all about. Hold that bar up there, alright? Good job. Never run with Ben when you don't know the workout. Heber: How often does Ben just sucker you guys into doing stuff like this? Everyday. Three times a day, everyday. Yeah, we usually run twice, twice a week, and then usually work out a lot. Yeah, those are probably just as bad as the runs. Heber: So after a workout like that, what hurts the most? My right calf. Heber: Very specific. Ben: Yeah. No, it's just my calves are tight. That's about it. Uh, I live, I live with my parents in the house I grew up in. Got maple brown sugar, cinnamon and spice. Get at me. I'll usually do this work out a little bit, and then have my big meal. I live as close to possible as expense-free as I can. Between sponsors and prize money, I make my living. I feel bad, I turn on the TV and just pretend (indecipherable) not here. TV's just for decoration. I'm just--this is it. There's no cable, so I just have Netflix, and that quit working, so I was just kind of like, \"Nah, alright.\" Bullet doesn't do anything unless it's a .45, right? Duh. I used to take 10 percent of any prize money and buy myself something nice, something I wouldn't normally buy myself. I don't live too luxuriously. I bought a Rumba a little while ago. That's pretty luxurious. That kind of stopped. I just found myself buying stuff. I was like, \"Why did I just buy a watch?\" I've never worn a watch. Like, I didn't really know how to do it, so I just put them up, the trips that have been purely for CrossFit, so I've got a bunch up there, a couple down here . I bet we'll fill that up a little bit. Because I look at any money that I earn during my CrossFit career as kind of bonus money. I don't consider it work, so it's people just paying me to have fun I guess, because I'm doing something that I genuinely love. So today was a long warmup. 15 minutes. So although we're in the same house, he has his own apartment. I love it. I absolutely love it. I think some of the nicest moments are when his country music turns on, starts blaring, and I\\'m like, \"Oh, that\\'s cool. He\\'s going to be training downstairs.\" I love it. Mat was a--he was a fun kid. Very adventurous. I remember at a young age I had to make him a cushioned helmet that went around his head so when he pulled up to the coffee table and then let go, he'd just fall backwards, because mission accomplished. He got what he wanted and now he's moving onto something else. The first time he really kind of started getting into fitness was he was doing push-ups outside, and then he wanted to take his mind off of his arms hurting, so he gives me this plastic golf club and says, \"Alec, hit me in the legs as hard as you can\" while he's doing push-ups. And so, I take this plastic golf club and just, I'm whacking him in the legs, and he's like still doing his push-ups, trying to take his mind off of his arms hurting. I really legitimately don't remember that. Did he actually tell a story like that? Did he dream of that? Because I have never heard of that in my entire life. I thought he was crazy. Like, he just wanted to work out all the time. It's been cool watching him progress. Sounds like something I might do, but I don't remember it. Mat's always had the competitive spirit. It doesn't matter what he's gone into. I remember the end of the season at Sugar Bush. He was doing the downhill aerial competition. So somebody came down and did a backflip, so then Mat came down and did a full layout, and then we heard some girls get off the lift and say, \"That last kid\\'s going to do a double back.\" We just--you know, \"Oh no. It better not be Mat. He's never attempted that in his life He's never done it. He's never tried it. He\\'s going to break his neck.\" You know? And sure enough, he came off the jump, and up he goes, and double backflip, and he lands, and I went over to him afterwards. I said, \"Congratulations, Mat. That was wonderful, but what ever, ever goes on in your mind to make you even think you could do that?\" He said, \"You know, Dad, I did a back layout. So did another guy,\" and he said, \"There\\'s no such thing as a one and a half,\" so he said, \"I just did the double.\" Because he just wanted to win so badly, and at the end of the day, he was competing for a snowboard, and he's not even a snowboarder. He's a skier. Just a lot of times, he would just, it would just be Ben in the garage working out by himself. I don't think there's ever going to be anyone like him again, because he really taught himself everything. He taught himself how to snatch. He taught himself how to clean and jerk, and it's all from the CrossFit videos that you guys put out. I mean, it's really honestly--he would watch for hours and hours and hours. He would take video of him from over there, and then he would put his video up against, like, you know, the Russian Olympic lifter versus the American Olympic lifter, and he would go frame by frame and see when he was forward, when he was back when he was on his heels, you know. It was just, you know, constant, analyzing the stuff. When you see some of the old videos where he's 2 inches away from the fridge when he gets a snatch up, you know, that fridge has got a lot of dents on the bottom of it from heels and kicks and, you know, misses that he wasn't real happy about. A lot of time out here. Candy and I always had one concern when he was weightlifting. Weightlifters just do not work cardio, and I remember meeting him at one of his meets, and the elevators were down so we took the stairs, and actually Candy and I were not huffing and puffing at the top of the stairs, and he was. He was out of breath, huffing and puffing, and I said, \"My gosh, how can this be healthy?\" And I think CrossFit is one thing that's really worked cardio for him. He's made a complete turnaround  when it comes to what he came into CrossFit with and what he has today cardio-wise. Just hasn't grown in yet all the way. I'm sure it will grow in a little bit. It's just not there yet. Any competition, any time that I compete, I want to win. It wasn't a fluke last year. I train, if not harder than anybody else out there, every single day, all year. It's just a matter of me staying healthy and feeling like I have a shot to win any time that I go to the Games. That's what I've always thought in the past, and this year is absolutely no different. I'm feeling better than I've ever felt. The day I got home from the 2015 Games I bought one of the pigs from the Games. Literally, I don't think I touched it for like a month or two purely just because I was, like, scared. I was like, \"What if the reason is I\\'m just not good enough?\" And then one night, I was just like, \"You know what, screw it.\" Going to the gym late at night by myself, turn on the one light, move the pig out into the middle of the room and just started flipping it. And it got to the point where I was going late at night. I\\'m like, \"Alright, I'm going to do 60 flips for time, do 100 flips for time,\" and it was like a every Sunday night type thing, and I would just flip it, flip it, flips it, just to make sure that if that comes up again, I'm as prepared as I can be for it. No, the regionals is not fun at all. Regionals is like the competition you kind of have to do, and you just gotta get it over with. I mean, it's fun winning the regionals, but it's not fun competing at the regionals. It's very stressful because it's like one slip-up, and that one event could be a dramatic change in your whole weekend. You know how the last event is. People jumping all over the leaderboard at the end, and so I was just lucky that I wasn't in that, like, third through sixth range like I was in the year before, so it was nice to push early in the weekend and have that little bump to sit on for the last day. No, no I wasn't trying to make a statement at regionals. I was just-- I was angry There's a handful of guys in the North East Region that have 300-lb. snatches, and I'm just kind of looking at it like, \"They\\'re here to beat me, and I\\'m not going to let that shit happen.\" All those guys showing up to the Games, they're there to win, and to win it, they've gotta beat everyone else and I'm one of those people that they have to beat, and for me, that's how I pay my bills, so I look at it like they're trying to take it from me. Of course I am. Yeah, I have a feeling, so-- I mean, we believe, so-- I felt it last year. Yeah, Ben will win the Games this year, for sure. Mat is the most competitive guy I've ever met. Mat suffers more than anybody else I know in training. Mat trains his weaknesses and adapts to training faster than anybody I've ever seen. Those three things are by far and away, fact. Is he capable of winning the Games? I might be very partial, but I think he is. I know he's got an inner drive that's going to work him through anything they throw at him. So last year was the first year he competed healthy. The year before that he twisted his ankle. The year before that, had knee surgery, so it's always been little things that have kept him back. Last year he was healthy. This year he's healthy. A lot of it's psychological as well, and I've never seen Mat in such a positive psychological state. I really think he's out with a vengeance this year. I hope he can be incredibly proud of whatever he does this year and where he places. Does he want to win? Absolutely. Would we love to see him win? Absolutely. We're incredibly proud of him. All year has been for the Games. Just from the numbers I'm putting up, the consistency I've been putting up, I am a much, much better athlete than I was last year. I'm lifting more, my cardio's better, I'm healthier, my mental game is stronger, so whatever the other guys bring, that's on them. This year my year has revolved around CrossFit training for the 2016 Games. I think I'm going to win the CrossFit Games this year. I love the Games. I love it. I show up, and I'm like, \"Bring it on, Dave.\" Like seriously, it\\'s cool. I love the surprises. The harder the better, and hopefully it's raining. You know what I mean? Like, that's what I love. I don't know, I'm weird. The challenge, I'm telling you, you gotta be driven. You can't be motivated by, like, the money. You can't be motivated by the fans. It's awesome, sure, but you gotta be internally motivated. You gotta love the challenge, and you gotta just put your head down and work through it. The harder the better. Don't take that out of context. You're going to go to the Games and you're going to see your competitors like almost passing out next to you. Yeah, I saw people carried off on stretchers last year. You know, you gotta expect that. You gotta know that whatever you do today in training, you have to push yourself to the absolute max capacity. In the competition floor, you don't want to be that person that's carried off on a stretcher. You're gonna be pushed physically. You're going to be pushed mentally beyond your capacity. You're not going to think you can go on and do another event, not just for one day, but for multiple days. If they're going to test the Fittest on Earth, it's gotta be a freaking grueling test. You know, it's gotta be challenging. It's gotta push you not only physically but mentally, and it does it every year. It's--I enjoy it.

Ted Turner just gave his 75th anniversary party on CNN a few months ago and he has, he makes a couple of comments and he says number one, and I'm not suggesting this for everybody, it's how I lived though. The first 10 years of my starting CNN, I slept on my couch, I didn't have an apartment. Bill Gates slept in the office, Steve Jobs slept in the office and I can go down a whole list. Now these are super successful mega-wealthy guys. I slept in my office, not everybody is willing to make that sacrifice. But it's not the only thing but even if you don't want to sleep in your office, if you want to send your kids to a better school, if you want to be able to take care of your mother when she gets dementia, if you want to... this all takes money. When I... my children aren't getting any of my money when I die. Not not one centavo, not one penny. And... Two of my kids are cool with it, one of them is not so cool with it. I'm not going to you know, I think Andrew Carnegie by the way, Andrew Carnegie arguably the richest most successful entrepreneur of all time. He said, the best thing that you can have for a child is him to be born into poverty. And I agree. Lack of self-esteem, lack of self-worth. Now they think they have self-worth, they think because they made a few bucks but in actuality, and when they measure it against the other 8, 10, 12 people sitting around the table they realize or they start the question \"Hell, maybe I was just lucky.\" Now all of us, when you're only a one-trick guy or gal think, \"Was I lucky?\" Now I've done it so many times, I know I wasn't lucky I might have been lucky the first time but I haven't been lucky the 15, 20, 40, 50, - I know that. - Okay But maybe I was lucky the first time. My life changed when I went, I was a pretty much... a haphazard kid got in a lot of trouble, got arrested 4 or 5 times, thrown in jail and this was with my dad as a cop. But then I went, I volunteered for the draft in 1966 at the height of the Vietnam War and I went to OCS and that changed my life because it was the really first real high performance thing that I could measure myself against, with other people. Two-thirds of all Fortune 500 CEOs have one thing in common - military background. - Really Two-thirds of those two-thirds have something else Martial Arts. What do you learn in martial arts Brian? Discipline, focus. A lot of people don't believe they deserve to be there I convinced them and we have these drills, why you belong there? A lot of people that come there, you know with money that have made money think they made it by accident. I just had one of my super stars whose made a hundred million bucks tell me in the last week, \"You know, I\\'m not sure I\\'m going to have another lucky accident.\" And I said, \"You did it.\" I mean, you know, you tried a lot of things. Thomas Edison, I would, I wouldn't have done it 10,000 times. I would've hired an engineer from MIT to do it. But I mean, I've tried a lot of things nobody's failed at more things than I have and the first 100 million are successes but I could write a book about failures that'd be I mean because I've tried a lot of different things because failure is just testing and one of the reasons I've been so successful in generating this equity and value in my kids -and I call you all kids- is because I convinced them that making a mistake is okay. Your parents probably told you you can be anything you want, but you can't. That's ***. You can't. If it's all juxtaposed So but what you tell them is that you can do anything you want that you have passion for. Because that eliminates most of the crap because most people don't follow their dream, you know, like they say in the sound of music. \"You can\\'t have a dream come true unless you have a dream\" Now I still dream, I dream in technicolor, I say my affirmations and goals every single night. It's bloody hard to be a high-performance person. Perfection equals paralysis. If you left it to the engineers, no car would ever come off the assembly line. No car would ever come off the assembly line and I've been in business with enough engineers that I can tell attest to that with my hand on my heart. They'd still be...

The internet kids want to test and test and test and they will want the landing page to be this Just roll it out, the great thing about the internet is your results are instantaneous. If something that I'm overseeing at a Concorde level 60,000 feet doesn't work in two days forget about it move on. And today I had our meeting now the young kids are, \"We ran it three days sir, and we closed it down.\" And they are thinking I'm going to ask why I said, \"No, that\\'s fine next\" Because without them making mistakes, and without them being allowed to make the decision they never get any better and 95% of the time I know probably better than they do, We're never going to be able to know everything or have them know everything unless they make some mistakes and get comfortable with making mistakes. What gets measured gets accomplished. Without measurement you're just fooling yourself. Before I had any money I used to go to the Rolls Royce dealers and sit in the cars and smell the leather touch the leather. Okay I went to million dollar houses and my wife and I would walk through the house and they\\'d say, \"When are your parents getting here kids?\" \"No, we are the buyers.\" Practice within when you're without. Practice being successful. How many people listening to this today practice being successful today. Through affirmations, through going to the Rolls Royce dealer. Maybe Lamborghini, maybe something else. In my particular case it was Rolls Royce. And within a year of me going to a Rolls Royce dealer, I had a Rolls Okay Within... 19 months of me dreaming and... adding it to my goals a castle on an island, I owned Guthrie castle. - 19 months - Okay Go to stores you can't afford.

Jettison, probably a lot of the people you hang around with. If you have poor public speaking skills join Toastmasters. Do these. If you go, if you went to a good school and you're not successful, go to the alumni deals Okay I didn't go to a good school, I'm a perfect living example that a lot of trouble as a kid, working-class background, my parents, went to just a mediocre university that I flunked out of three times before I finally graduated with honors, but... And I had no money to begin with, $820 So it's all possible But I, you know, I devoted myself to feeling successful. I was wearing suits like this, before I could afford them. Most people procrastinate because they're unsure. So just do it. And, but I've never had a problem just doing it because one of the things you learn as a young combat, infantry officer is time cost lives. We over analyze because we're unsure, we're not- over analyze, we don't over analyze because we are not sure. If it will work or not, we're more worried about on the emotional side it embarrassing us.", "l4a7MBfz-sw": "", "PKfR6bAXr-c": "what did you learn Longevity and why I eat once a day. Nutrition and our hybrid body In 1950, my friend Bill was a very talented engineer who made an extraordinary car The primary fuel of the car was electricity, and gasoline was placed when available. It was OK to use gasoline every two days or more, but the problem was That people kept it on gasoline almost 90% of the time. This caused the car to break down frequently, while Bell was trying to tell people \"Use it the way it was designed!\" Despite his advice, people continued to develop theories about how to use the car correctly. Bell went bankrupt and left the car industry shortly after. This dilemma in which my imaginary poor friend Bill found himself quite similar Our modern healthy environment How has eating become so complicated? Most of us just want to feel good, look good and live a long life. You would have believed that by this time there should be a clear consensus on what to eat in our eating habits You look like it, but we're facing a myriad of ideas on this topic. Maybe we should follow the ABC diet or XYZ diet or something in between? One of the first diets was proposed by a man named George Chain in 1724. Now, on Amazon you can find over 50,000 different books on this topic. Like a Bell car, there is definitely a simple way to nourish our bodies Most suitable for its design. Obviously we are not engineers, but Homo Sabian appeared about 200,000 years ago And most of the time, the nutritional environment cannot be the same as it is today Agriculture did not even exist for 190,000 years from that time. Not even the fruits and vegetables we had today were the same If we do not grow it according to our tastes. Only 700 years ago this was how the banana looked. So what is the way we eat? The environment was choosing our diet instead of us. Your options were to eat what was available or to be dead. The idea that our bodies have adapted to a certain percentage of the nutrients available in the amount In the environment is not new. And recently it has become well known because of \"Paleo Diet\". However, what I want to reach is that our body also had to adapt With when food is available - there should be a natural frequency of food time, be reinforced Health and longevity. where do I start? It stands to reason that more food and food will make you healthier and live longer. But let's take a look at this from the \"first principles\" method as Elon Musk described it: \"It is somewhat rationally easier to conclude by way of measurement rather than the first principles. The first principles are a kind of physics way of looking at the world. What this means is that things get back to the most basic facts And she says \"Okay, what are we sure about its authenticity? Then, you start from there. And that requires a lot of mental energy. \" So what do we know about longevity? Other than exercise, the word \"super foods\" may come to mind. Maybe more omega-3 or some red wine, or make sure that we take supplements and drink Less alcohol will make us live longer. There are a lot of things that contribute to longevity, but there is one way before it Science can be used to increase longevity steadily. \"If you take any organism on the planet from yeast cells to spiders, insects and rabbits And dogs ... and cut their caloric intake by 30%, they live 30% longer. The only organism that has not yet been carefully tested by scientists is Homo sapiens (modern man)! \" Let's start here. For a time, the conventional wisdom was that you needed to get 3 balanced meals A day to stay healthy. Since I was a child, \"breakfast, lunch and dinner\" were as natural as sleeping Or go to the bathroom. Breakfast was the most important meal of the day, and I needed a healthy lunch to focus The rest of the school day, and going to sleep without dinner was child abuse. The situation is the same in Japan where I live now As in the rest of the world If we want to reduce calories to increase life, the only option is to eat less For every meal, we need 3 meals, right? But where did the idea of \u200b\u200b3 meals come in today? As Abigail Carroll suggests in her book \"Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal\": He ate three meals a day that was invented mainly due to cultural reasons, when European settlers arrived in America They found the indigenous people ate food whenever they felt Desiring this, not at specific times. Europeans considered the absence of specific dates for eating as evidence that they were uncivilized And they changed them. In short: the three-meal model per day is not based on our biological needs. How our environment designed us. It was not surprising at all in the culture of hunting and gathering to eat a big catch, then live on very little or without any food For long periods of time until they need another great source of fat and protein. In fact, the environment so far suggests that if we hadn't been able to do that, Often we will not be alive to read about dieting. The Pirah\u00e3, a group of indigenous people in the Amazon jungle His study is widely recognized by an anthropological linguist named Daniel Evert. He found that they do not eat every day or even try to do so. They were even familiar with food storage techniques but they never used them except for bartering Brazilian merchants. When asked why they did not store food for themselves, they explained, \"I am storing Meat in my brother's belly. \" Until the advent of agriculture, eat 3 meals a day, in some cases even eating Every day was almost impossible. Some of you may indicate that the average life expectancy is in the Stone Age It was much less than it is now i.e. about 33 years old, as evidence that modern eating habits more healthy. However, the infant mortality rate was a major factor in reducing this number. You have to understand that one of the effects of modern civilization and technology is that it is You can either not be resourceful or your genetic material weak and not die. As Doug McGough explains about life expectancy at the time: \"It was not a relationship A catabolic anabolic balance or long-term health benefits due to presence Elderly survivors and fossil evidence from these survivors are shown on the basis of ligaments And the evaluation of the bone and bone mineral density indicates that they were very strong. \" Glucose metabolism and how \"conventional wisdom\" has harmed us A common misconception is that blood sugar stability is essential to survival Which biologically justifies the three meals a day. Take a little biochemistry with me to understand why you consume carbohydrates constantly To maintain the blood sugar level is not only unnecessary but it can be a harmful and vicious cycle. So, after you've eaten some carbohydrates - bread, pasta, and candy, whatever. Glucose enters the bloodstream and produces insulin to properly distribute glucose. By means of insulin receptors, glucose enters cells to produce energy. This can only happen at a certain rate, so to avoid cell or glucose flooding Glucose remaining in the bloodstream, 70 grams can be stored in the liver and 200 grams in the muscles. So when you eat bread in the morning and some coffee - \"What do you want, some vanilla nonsense Latte and coffee drink, anything you have, I don't care. \"It stores all Glucose that you can store. So he has to go to your body fat. In addition to storing it as energy, your body places it in your body fat because the fat cells It has less complex mechanisms than other cells. Too much glucose can bind to proteins and block the mechanism of cells in A harmful inflammatory process called glycation. It's like pouring a sweet drink into a motor car. The problem here is that if your own energy levels decrease, you cannot utilize the energy In your body\u2019s fat stores because the hormone responsible for this - the sensitive lipase hormone is Insulin sensitive. Insulin will not allow you to take advantage of body fat for energy. If you have too much insulin in your bloodstream as a result of treating too much glucose Before and now you need energy, you will feel very hungry, and you will need to be raised Short-term blood sugar through a snack or something to lift your energy levels again. This is why if you follow the recommended American diet, it will often be Stuck in this episode of wanting to eat every time you have low blood glucose Three meals a day will seem very necessary. Even doctor Peter Atia fell victim to this: \"Despite exercising 3 or 4 hours Every day and literally following the food pyramid, I gained a lot of weight And I have something called \"metabolic syndrome\" Ketosis rescue If you stop taking glucose for 10 to 12 hours, You will run out of glucose stores and your body will start to break down fat The liver can produce what are called ketone bodies. Ketogenic bodies produce energy for the body's cells via glucose-like pathways But it is more stable and efficient and does not cause complications like those we talked about. You may have heard of the ketosis condition referred to as \"starvation status\" in school, however This does not in any way suggest that you were about to starve. I don't particularly like this term because it indicates that glucose / carbohydrates Is the primary fuel source for the body, While it is possible to live completely without carbohydrates. \"Humans don't have any need for carbohydrates. Not even a single gram. We have this wonderful liver that produces glucose whenever you need it. \" Example: A 456-year-old man in Scotland fasted for 382 days He only consumed water and vitamin supplements. He lost 276 lbs and continued fasting with no bad effects. Technically he was in \"starvation mode\" all this time and his body was being used His body stores fat for energy. A quick note: ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis are not the same. Several years ago, when I first heard about low-carb diets, I was honestly skeptical When I heard that my best friend's mother was trying the Atkins diet, I was worried about her. However, after understanding the biochemistry behind it, I started following the Paleo diet. \" Overall I felt great, my fitness was better with less effort and much more stable energy levels The downside is that i was annoying planning meals so much, so i was Cheat a lot from time to time. The benefits of fasting Even after people have been in environments where She can eat many more times, the concept of fasting persists for its health benefits For some time. There is an inscription in an Egyptian pyramid from about 3800 BC stating the following: \"Humans live on a quarter What they eat. On the other three quarters the doctor lives. \" Plato appears to have fasted for mental efficiency, and \"Luther of Medicine\" Phillips Paracelsus said about fasting \u201cthe greatest remedy,\u201d and Mark Twain suggested that fasting More effective than any drug. Even the Romans found that they could heal people who were worn by demons Being locked in a room without food. Fasting and aging. To simplify an incredibly complex process, aging in substance is the result of an accumulation Damage to your DNA. Professor of Genetics, David Sinclair and his team found that non-eating stimulates Sirtuin proteins that are directly responsible for repairing the DNA. It is classified as a key factor in longevity. Neuroscience professor Mark Matson, at Johns Hopkins University showed How fasting stimulates the growth of new nerve cells in the brain. This explains why fasting has been associated with the prevention of neurological diseases Such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. This information made me enthusiastic about intermittent fasting. With intermittent fasting do not eat for 16 hours a day that gives your body Time to deplete your glucose stores and start burning fat And also reap the benefits discussed above. Many sources indicate that the main factor here is whether you are following a long fast Intermittent fasting or simply eating less, you give your body a chance Glucose stores are depleted, and ketosis begins, resulting in the discussed health benefits. I was aware of the fact that it is possible to get similar effects from the Paleo diet with more freedom in my diet. The problem with intermittent fasting was that I found myself craving food outside Eight hours, and I still have to be somewhat strict with what I eat Although it is not as strict as the three-meal system per day. Upton Sinclair, who was born in the late 1800s and lived long until the nineteen years of age, He published a book in 1911 entitled \"Fasting is a cure.\" The book was inspired by the personal experiences of 250 people cured some diseases across Prolonged fasting. Diseases range from colds, headaches, constipation to arthritis, Valvular heart disease and cancer. Dr. Alan Goldmer talked about how, in 2012, a 42-year-old patient had recovered from cancer (stage Third of lymphoma) by fasting for 21 days. All this made me try my first week in the long fast ... but I stopped on the fourth day Although I did not feel bad. While I missed my goal and didn't feel much different after that, After several days, I started to notice something. I used to eat some refined sugar from time to time, but after fasting I was not interested. It was like remodeling my taste in food. Meanwhile, I discovered a book called \"Kuufuku ga hito o kenkou ni suru\". Written by Dr. Yoshinori Nagumo. The title means \"Hunger makes people healthy.\" It provides an incredibly convincing argument to challenge yourself with one meal per day. The book covered many of the things that I talked about here, and some things that I did not do Some of my concerns were dispelled like malnutrition. Also, it was easy to trust him as he is 30 years older than me and looks younger I decided to try to eat once a day for two weeks. For 3 weeks before starting, I used to give my sister a little bit around Tokyo I was eating anything and everything looked good. It started with Nagumo the next day you left and the first three days were definitely the hardest. When it was around 11 a.m., I realized that I am not getting pleasure from the usual food On them at this time of day and felt very eager to eat. My stomach wasn't really painful, it was equivalent to not being able to play With video games after returning from school. At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was convinced that I was really hungry and needed to eat. Waiting another 30 minutes until four thirty was like the last batch of squatting exercises. The next two days were a little easier, and on the fourth day I noticed that I was no longer looking at time and thinking \"Oh ... only four hours for food!\" After a week, I decided to test the diet by riding a bike for fifty kilometers Atsugi from Tokyo. I didn't exercise much and my usual bike ride was about 3 km. Unsurprisingly, it was difficult, but I didn't feel my physical weakness. I felt the pain of hunger earlier than usual, but I didn't feel like I was less powerful than Lack of food. This made me stick to eating once a day. It's been a month since I started and feel great overall My energy levels are very stable, I feel more focused and curiously I have fewer problems with hunger compared With intermittent fasting. Even if I don't eat a healthy meal I can now feel confident that my body is He has more time to get rid of excess glucose or the toxins that you have eaten. The only time I crave unhealthy food is when I have had some alcohol. Looking back, it's hard to imagine a lot of food piling up in my stomach all day long. In addition to health benefits, another reason to do this is the same reason that Steve was Jobs wears the same thing every day: it makes choosing easier It frees my mind to focus on other things. At least for me, the amount of new information I get is a small factor in my behavior change For example, if my knowledge of alcohol harms increases, for example, by 60% Maybe I will cut my consumption by 30%. With this article alone, I do not expect you to suddenly start eating once a day, But I hope you start by giving your body a break and eating when you need it, Not when the watch says you should.

here today live bodybuilding vs. CrossFitting thanks Nate we're doing great here today at the Six Pack Shortcuts training arena the course is set but before we get started let's have a word with the contenders so we got Johnny here something awful in today feeling pretty good a little bit low on carbs got a competition for weeks I'm actually zero carbs but that doesn't matter I'm ready to go today you're lifting zero zero carbs all right so what do you think is the biggest difference between your style of training versus across fitters and what advantages would you have there's definitely a lot of differences but the biggest difference being all the isolation work I do I mean I think that will definitely come in advantageous to a lift like a bench or squat having that strength that I'm always constant consistently working on they might have a little bit of edge in the endurance but the strength and power that's that's your boy right here bodybuilding side well said well said okay we got Ricky over here how you feeling today I'm feeling pretty great trains been going well awesome so are you low-carbon today no no you're you're full of energy all of our man-cakes so what would you say is the biggest difference between your style of training versus the bodybuilders and would have Vantage would you have well the biggest difference really is goals um we both got different goals but I do lots more compound bigger lifts like squats Olympic lifts like cleaning jerk your snatch and my my strength would be more endurance obviously a little bit better conditioning okay so this is definitely your sport it's awesome so without further ado we got event number one benchpress these contenders are going to be pressing 225 pounds no bouncing full range of motion one set to failure so you guys ready  - one let's go good Johnny well done  let's go go with your aura  come on  there you go  yup there we go this one alright so for our next event we've got box jumps we're gonna give these guys a little breather so I'm going to talk a little bit slower and the rules for the Box jump is going to be that you have to plant both feet on the box stand up all the way full extension and they were going to go one full minute to as many as they can ready okay and three two one go  and second  so for 30 Vince is going to be long jump each contender is going to have three tries no running star standing still and we're going to take the longest jump out of the three and we're going to mark them with some tape Johnny is going to be in blue and Ricky is going to be the great ape I'm pretty good warmed up now so I'm good to go  okay so we got Ricky the great ape Johnny in the blue tape now these guys have been going head-to-head each event that we've done thus far so who gets a longer rest break I think Johnny because Ricky said he's just getting warmed up  okay so go rec first attempt here we go I'm gonna from the back of this you of where he lands  Oh  same Wow place now we discuss this before we started that even if they fall back it still counts for the back of the heel Lance all right  and last one  the sky  it looks like it's a tie cuz they're both are this is neck and neck so what that means is we're both tremendous athletes I mean I would know how to put it there's lots of explosion between the two of us yet lots of basically both be honest both types of training CrossFit bodybuilding you're both you're getting explosiveness from both of them they're just two different stops like he said different goals you say a lot of power between the two of them because there's a lot of explosions that's when - Hannah sounds  okay here we go next one we got the pull-up contest no swinging no kipping they've got to do a full range of motion arms fully extended so there's no partial reps all the way up all the way down without further ado on three two one and go go John go boys  here we go boy  kogami  oh yeah this Johnny  20 seconds 20 seconds all right that was rough how you feelin so good that was rough I got a very respectable opponent over here mr. Ricky does beasts hang a lot like why shiny like what this guy doesn't even breathe okay so we're moving on to the back squat just meaning we're doing squats with the bar on the back and they're going to load 225 onto the rack they're going to go down to parallel and they're going to compete for a full minute all right so we're ready Johnny you ready ready Ricky ready okay so one minute squats on three two one and go there we go  there you go stop it you can taste it taste go Johnny be strong boy push it we are going all right let's go down we go 30 seconds come on Johnny halfway there  20 seconds left guys you're great  well I've got it first I want to thank my competitor for being a badass competitor competition something I wanted to go to show or say is it just good to show any type of training is beneficial CrossFit bodybuilding running jump rope whatever it is just do it and do it to your best ability sir you can you go before like me Ricky Ricky any comments I agree with Johnny it's all about what you put into it doesn't matter if you're doing bodybuilding CrossFit you're outside moving that's all that counts amen amen all right so we're going to take a minute add up the scores and we're going to come right back and we'll figure out who the ultimate winner is  so the results are in guys I know you guys are excited to see who the clear winner is and unfortunately there's no clear winner there is a winner but only by two points so today's competition winner goes to by two points Six Pack Shortcuts Johnny  and head atop this one okay my body building Pam cross the competitors amazing athletes so anybody ever say anything bad about soccer just use a badass but for my bodybuilding fan whoo  back to you Nate what an amazing competition I mean it was hands-down neck-and-neck here in the studio we got Clarke Chou Oh tell me what your thoughts about it well judging from the footage I actually noticed that Johnny did not go as far down on the squats as Ricky did and I know a lot of you viewers are going to critique that he did not go as deep but however we did specify at the beginning of the competition the rules were going down to parallel and from my experience in squatting I actually kind of feel like when I go all the way down I get a little bounce from the bottom versus stopping the weight halfway and changing directions so I would say that they both would qualify as far as each rep that they did they're both just as difficult to do and they're both good in their own sense so right I would not say one is better than the other right and you have to keep in mind that when you drop below knees below parallel you get more glute recruitment and more hammering involvement as opposed to stopping parallel it's just majority all quad action mm-hmm yeah so tell me what do you think about the long jump what are your thoughts on that well I would say as far as a long jump you know I was thinking about power-to-weight ratio you know who was taller way more or less but actually they're both neck-and-neck they're off by 5 pounds they're both the same height and they actually landed at the exact same distance scrub so I mean that's that just goes to show that between CrossFitting and bodybuilding there is no clearly defined winner there right and the benchpress let's go over that what do you think about that now I think that that is where Johnny had a bit of an advantage on the benchpress just because in bodybuilding is it's a movement that you do a lot more than you would in CrossFit so we did see that Johnny kind of had an advantage over that one right there but then Ricky came back and he his points on the pull-ups right and then go over the pool so what he would talk about for him talk about technique would you see there what I noticed over there on the pull-ups was that Ricky did put his chin higher up towards the bar but what I've noticed with embody builders is whenever you get your lat so developed you don't have that range of motion to get all the way up here and for somebody who has such a wide back getting your chin close to the bar is about as far as you can go anyways right okay without swinging actually and so the Box jump box jump okay now that was another one that was neck and neck right there so um I really don't have any comments on a box jump that was just a straight up tie on that one yeah yeah it was extremely close so both of their forms were pretty much the same on the box jump I think Ricky might have a little bit of an advantage just because he is a crossfitter and he probably has a little more experience with it versus Johnny who doesn't incorporate that into his routine as frequently as Ricky goes yeah keep in mind that you're doing a lot more CrossFit involved exercises you do a lot more explosive movements and get more hip recruitment so that's it I'm probably that's probably where it helped him out and have that advantage yeah yeah and of course practice makes perfect so the more you do something the better you get at it always always so what are your overall thoughts Clark about the whole competition well I would have to say that between bodybuilding and cross fitting they are neck-and-neck you can't really say one is better than the other it's not comparing apples to apples you know with CrossFitting it's a sport it's a competition with bodybuilding it's a different kind of competition in sport where you're showing off your physique versus your I guess endurance or stamina so it they both have their strengths and there really is no clearly defined winner so by two points only that is pretty much a tie I would say yeah I'd say they both equally won in their own strengths I hope you all enjoyed this week's special edition of Six Pack

shaker here are you surprised by those skin age results yes I am actually totally surprised but I'll be 60 in about three weeks I'm seeing you up close here it's not even close all right so you got to fight a nutrient that you use every day then you say our audience might benefit from yes I drink coupla shots in the morning but one of my favorite ones it's like the wheatgrass I'm it's an antioxidant it's the Sun energy food it gives you energy I do it every morning so I'd say a couple of shots in the head you know always at all I don't know who is five o'clock somewhere so we made it in this pocket and if you like but I put I put a little Cayenne in mine it does the same thing as vodka though it doesn't make you look for it but it's actually even with that it cuts down on the headaches through all this stuff and we're just you ready you're phytonutrients shot you take us every day every day in the morning in the morning I think you look like you anywhere close to you I'm gonna do this I tell you many take one to  you know I tell you it does jar you it's a but to get through that fight nutrient shot that's a pretty famous way doing it and if it again if anything close to what you've accomplished I'm in yes please do it is absolutely amazing what it does god bless you thank you kuvira you kindly introduced yourself the end of the segment how old are you really if you don't mind my asking dr. oz I am 71 years old I'm going to be 72 alright so 72 let's say well not 72 yet everyone 71 I was around down to 70 but here's the study part we ran the Vizia skin - scanner on you okay you know what's your real ages and your skin no look at you you're 52 what is the tip you do every day that you attribute than most of this benefit so I know you know there's lots of things you doing in your lifestyle what's the one we could all do at home right now I think vegetables this is my secret your secret well that was what is what is this do you want to taste don't you want me tell you first well let's do both all right but what it it's a prune they are still prunes yes two pros we ate stood for was maybe it was because we had that as a dessert I don't know at least twice the week we had stood prunes mm-hm because you know all about poopoo right if you don't keep it clean well being constipated and if you're constipated you're not clean you don't poop the unhappy dissipated face yes yes of course it shows up in your face nobody wants to bury things painted face you don't have clarity your skin is dull and no one wants a constipated face no listen listen to Vera coming right god bless you besides the other one right now to find out your skin's real age with a quiz me developers my partners that share care these are great guys right there world experts and they brought in some great dermatologists to help figure this out so the entire audience pull yoga clipboards out this is a test for anyone aged 35 or above it's only three questions guys there's a bigger quiz you can take it dr. oz calm or on cher care but right now I can't keep track of aids B's and C's for three questions I'm gonna tell you how to calculate your age in just a second so question number one you have bags under your eyes so answer for myself you do for yourselves all these please be honest I I definitely have is my big problem I've got the stink bags alright so whatever you happen to be no small ones or distinct bags answer the question as honorably as you can question number two do you see crow's feet at the outer corners of your eyes right out here right is it no yes slight lines I see them there my friends came for sure or yes I stare at them every day in the mirror right pick the one that makes you I'm and I think I don't have any what do you guys think okay on crow's feet I'm getting a pretty good judgment here all right now for the final question do you smile or whether you see smile lines in the corner of your nostrils to your mouth those are the lines that those little lines nasal labial lines right in here right there I think guy soft lines I'll give I'll give myself the benefit here soft lines now here's how you grade okay so for me I had one of each letter so whatever you are you the match start at your actual age alright so for every time you put an A in there I wants to subtract five years but every time you put a B as an answer you changed nothing everything you put a see you add five years so my case I actually lost five I gained five and then I had a B so nothing so I'm 56 so my real skin age is about the same as my actual age and again this is the beginning use this test is sort of a clue of where you belong but it takes the real skin a real age test if the true one it's called the stimulation test quiz go to dr. Oz calm or share care calm right now to check it out be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything remember to check back often to see what's new", "gG3h749G6eY": "[Music]  my name is Adrienne Conway and I'm the host here of the brute showdown what we aim to do is through the next two days we're going to take four athletes each from a separate discipline and we're gonna put them through eight events now the goal is through these eight events to create a very diverse broad range of physical tests that's gonna show us who is the most athletic through the course of these eight tests we are going to actually give each of the specialty athletes an opportunity to thrive so what that means is there there will be a max clean for the Olympic weightlifter there will be a max deadlift for the power lifter there will be a pose down for the bodybuilder or physique specialist and then there will be a CrossFit workout where the CrossFit athlete is going to get an opportunity to shine now outside of those four we're gonna add another four we're not gonna specifically dive into what they look like but we know they're gonna be outside of the capacity of each one of these specialty athletes so the goal is to see who can thrive not to send their special skill set but also outside of that and show us who's the most well-rounded  just recently I won a medal at the World Championships which super pool has the only one to do it this year and then other than that I wanted drawn same thing bronzed last year that world so I think those are the two like looks like your your goal like what are you striving to achieve which 2020 Olympics so that's the main goal that's what we're working for that's kind of just started with worlds was the first like qualifier so it's going to be along next like 50 or 60 months of just competing and trying to increase my total every time and then hopefully oh my name is Maddy Rogers I'm 23 I'm from Orlando Florida and I'm an Olympic weightlifter so I started in gymnastics and I did that for about 12 years and then I did a little bit of like track and field in school and switched into competitive cheerleading and then from there my coach introduced me to CrossFit and that's where I met the coach that I have now and I did CrossFit for about a year and then I just I liked Olympic weightlifting so much better so in 2014 I competed in my first national meet and then from there I think I made my first junior international team the same year and from there it's kind of been like a crazy journey to here I was the alternate for the 2016 Olympics so this time around I'm hoping maybe a little bit of redemption and so far I mean the quad has been going pretty well I've meddled at the last two World Championships which is it's something that I didn't really think was possible when I first started because it was more of like those bigger countries that you see with weightlifting on the podium so that in itself has been just great to be able to do that with USA weightlifting what are you doing Louisiana we're all convenient sir will do one event unlike each modality or each sport and yeah then we're gonna do some like actual sports stuff too but I'm not sure what all those events are I'm a Brooke ence I am 29 and I'm from Santa Cruz California I won the California regional in 2015 I went on to take have two rookie wins the CrossFit Games in 2015 finishing top 15 at the CrossFit Games and I was cast as an Amazon in the blockbuster movie Wonder Woman as well as the Justice League so I filmed two movies came back from a final fusion to compete at Regionals again my daily training right now is far different than what it used to be because I am still recovering from injury [Music]  so right now it's all about moving sweating and then doing making sure I get some lifting in and then PT I'm just trying to make sure I'm really focusing on my recovery and my PT for my shoulders I am currently not I can sleep with no pain which that has not been the case for years and so I'm very careful with my training and not overdoing it but prior to injury it was Chua days at least two hours in the gym and six days a week was what's up first I'm probably gonna do like my accessories I'm trying to make my body feel  [Music] [Applause] my training usually I'll do about eight sessions a week two days a week I'll do a two a day and then the other days are just a really intensive probably three-hour session I try not to take so long but it just it takes a while and we'll go through all the technical movements a pulling movement a pressing movement and then I do a lot of accessory and prehab rehab things and we try and do a lot of strength stuff cuz I think that's where I was lacking when I came in from gymnastics because I could do had the mobility I had like decent power but my overall just strength was not where it should be so that's something that we've been focusing on for four years now  [Applause]  you just did a double that what is that should be 148 Nikhil is somewhere between 320 and 330 but what what's your one rep PR squat sounds weird but like I don't really max out my squat okay like there's never I'll have like heavy singles and I guess I feel good that day I'll go up but it's not like the focus it's kind of like it's an accessory movement for us so that's that ever done is 170 500 why okay I'm not there right now but hopefully I'm somewhere like near there yeah I think I'm supposed to look forward to like my sport the most what I'm actually most excited for all the events that we're doing on Sunday which are like they're running the jumping like the things that none of us really have an advantage in because I think that's really going to show like who the more like well-rounded athlete is sorry but smell like an airplane but I probably  it's just like we're gonna go regurgitated air from like you know what I mean  smells like someone else's fart right now  I'm good my name is Dana Ling Bailey I am 35 years old I am a professional bodybuilder I have dabbled a little bit in powerlifting I was on American Ninja Warrior I think that's it for now main sport bodybuilding [Music]  [Music] probably my most notable accomplishment was winning the Olympia I was the first ever well actually even before winning the Olympia so I competed in bodybuilding for quite some time as a figure competitor and this was before physique which is my category so that it goes bikini figure Fitness probably falls before physique and then bodybuilding so physique never existed and the first show that they introduced physique and I was like I'm gonna do it it sounds like just my alley it's between figure and bodybuilding and I was always dead last in figure shows dead laughs because I had too much muscle or I was too lean but I liked the way I looked so I never really changed the way I looked based on judges so I did the first show and I actually was the first ever physique champion so I was the first ever IFBB Pro physique champion and then in 2013 for the first Olympia became the first ever miss Olympia for Zeke what do you know so far about  that most of the things that we're doing I don't do and I heat and I wish they would just train shoulders with me instead yeah but you're ready to like flex often and this weekend I am least looking forward to close down I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm super nervous I mean I'm obviously not a bodybuilder in any way I'll do some like curls every now and then but that's about as close as it gets I tried to do last bread it's like the only one I know and I can't do it I was told to just do a glute spread instead I don't think that's appropriate so I'm just gonna wing it [Music] ah I trained a little bit differently I trained different than a bodybuilder I trained different than a powerlifter and I think with adding different aspects so after I was done competing I wanted to take a break because bodybuilding takes a toll on your body mostly mentally I needed the break just to become a normal person and not carry food around with me and not be so worried about like having a treat and then getting on the elliptical or a stair Mill than that very next day for 40 minutes so I wanted to be a normal person and so for the first year I took a break and I'm still training obviously still doing cardio still like training really hard but I was like missing like that competitive side like I wanted to compete in something so I got into powerlifting I do like training for certain things it helps motivate my workouts a little bit more and I've always been a really good bench presser I'm not very good at dead lifting but I like to squat and I like to bench so what I entered my first I guess meat they're called nachos I almost said shows so I entered my first meat I actually want it and then I had a high enough Wilkes core to get me to Nationals did Nationals my whelk score was high enough to get me to the Arnold so then I did the Arnold last year so a lot of my workouts now are a mix of powerlifting and bodybuilding because for me I I don't just have one goal my goal isn't just to look good like I want to be strong not necessarily trained for just strength but I want to keep my strength maybe get stronger in certain things but then I also want to look good too so it usually starts off with like a heavy compound lift so if it's like day obviously I would start with squats and then it's like probably an hour and a half of a lot of accessory work a lot of super sets drop sets so that's about how I like to train I want to be strong and look at I think my biggest threat in this competition is gonna be DL be Daniel and Bailey and there's a she's an athlete she's not just a physique competitor she came into this as our physique competitor but she's a power lifter you know she's she's a fierce competitor and [Music] yeah and she she's got the crazy two which you need like in the CrossFit event so they're just better be someone watching those reps and make sure they're all full range of motion you know what I mean but yeah she's gonna crush it but I am I'm out to a out to play so where's the rest of the game maddie is doing Olympic lifts [Music] my name is Maddie for Berg I am 21 years old and I am a power lifter I started powerlifting about almost three years ago I'm now competing in the USA PL I just competed recently at raw nationals in Spokane Washington I am also in nursing school at Illinois State University and I only have one semester left which has been huge with training and trying to compete and travel midst of clinicals and things like that so yeah but she looked at me and look to a hint like okay yeah I know I know if she is she teaching someone how to do pull-ups right now you guys look to over here I'm doing strict pull-ups sets of five because that's all I can do and it's like I'm a fifth one is it that's it and you're doing he's in pumps and we're pressing straight frats he did blowing up the arms we're gonna have a grin up dlb show us how to pose she's a doctor she goes but you have not lost any size I'm like hey my upper body feels like deflated like it was like fitting Jaquish it's weird I couldn't wear my jacket a couple of things I'm looking forward to the clean just because I just barely got to start lifting again so it feels really good for me regardless of what weight is on the bar just to be moving weight and just to be under a barbell that is my like bread and butter with my training and so it feels really good to just be back doing that and then also the CrossFit workout cuz I gotta beat these weightlifter somewhere you know got a win where I can look at me watch me say that and I just chuckle tomorrow so do you know what yes  okay I used to play soccer so we're gonna win she was high I played when I was like eight years old so yeah I would rather not you know break my nose yeah I  broke my nose once but I was like hit in the face of the softball so why didn't I saw least looking forward to it's definitely softball doing I I picked powerlifting as my sport because I'm not coordinated so the least thing I'm looking forward to is having it hit an actual vault I cannot do that for the life of me I tried in high school in gym class it was one of those things where like we're up to bat and I like struck out so many times my gym teachers like we'll just give her a chance Maddie you can get it anything at the end it's just like got it where you're you're done you're just a lost cause so definitely softball because I'm not that coordinated I have no idea who's gonna win because I think I mean I would hope we all do well in our individual sport I think it's gonna come down to everything that we do on Sunday that's really gonna make a difference what is the the running stuff that we have to do okay so they say we have to do a sprint we have  I'm like agility thing where you have to like start here right here right here back okay so I might break my ankles and I have done a little bit of practice getting ready for this event just because I never did any CrossFit events leading up to this including any of the weightlifting movements so I have never done a clean before this I had I I trained at a weightlifting gym so everyone's pretty profess proficient at weightlifting so I asked one of the coaches if he could just teach me the movement because I was afraid I was gonna come out here and be like how do I do this one and so I did a little bit of pre-emptive training in that way but that's that's about it I have ran a little bit but no outside Sprint's or anything crazy like that so today we got in we get into the gym everybody's doing the thing to kind of knock the dust off if you guys haven't been a traveling athlete you might not know not much about this but any traveling athlete getting off the plane you want to get into the gym you want to knock the dust off you want to get ready for whatever you need to do whether it's present whether it's compete we all got into the gym and what do you see I'll tell you what I saw I saw a Maddy Rogers that had the eye of the tiger in the gym right like she walked in there she had her notebook open she did her mobility to get right to work and she was in there and she grinded for like three hours now it's a little bit of a different feel compared to what I saw from the other ladies we were kind of having some fun joking around we did a little round-robin of kind of like a pump session that Dana led but I wonder and you guys can tell me because you'll know as you watch this I wonder if that's gonna have a reflection on how this weekend will go everyone's here to win and so I believe that that's gonna actually be the the outcome and the reflection of the weekend but we got to keep our eye on Maddy Rogers she came in focused and ready to rock  [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Unnvj58sP3I": "playing big-time sports is not always full of fame and victory athletes are people too and they like everyone else are prone to make mistakes if you make a mistake only a couple people will laugh for a few minutes at your failures and immediately forget the failures of these athletes will be remembered for the rest of their careers hi there and today we will look at the 20 most embarrassing moments in sports at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro during the competition of racewalking something very strange happened a bad case of diarrhea caught this athlete by surprise right during the competition and there was nothing the poor man to do about it in this video the suit of British bobsledder gillian cooked burst open before the start of the descent and became a big hit on youtube  [Music]  Lord of Aston Villa Nicholas Helen OU's would have scored another goal if he had not been hindered in such a cheeky way with shorts at the knees it is quite difficult to score a goal  [Applause]  and this Saudi goalkeeper decided to score into his own goal  [Applause] next we have basketball Sam Decker has an excellent breakaway opportunity but as it gets into the open court he trips over his own feet and ends up knocking the ball out of bounds with his face this is a prime example of how not to play basketball and here we have Chicago Bulls Ford Carlos Boozer while celebrating a made basket Boozer accidentally hits the referee with a huge punch right in the nono zone with all his might [Music] some athletes start to enjoy their victory ahead of time this ice skater has overtaken his rivals and has already started to wave his hands to the fans but he tripped fell and the last meter delve on his stomach he had time to overtake but instead of first place he finished fourth  [Music]  a very unusual outcome into the duel between Daniel Cooper and travis Walford a regular MMA fight had an unusual ending after daniel used a choked technique his opponent relaxed too much bright in the cage I think that from now on during future fights Travis will definitely take the toilet paper  and here we see how during the fight both fighters simultaneously sent each other to the ground with a knockout  [Music]  and this is an incredible double knockout after which the fighters could not get up and more than both of them needed medical assistance [Music]  while playing a baseball game you can get a bunch of bruises and abrasions this player decided to view the damage he received from a fall and begin to take off his pants right on the field  [Applause] they say that a good goalkeeper makes up about half of the team but sometimes they make funny and ridiculous mistakes [Music]  and this goalkeeper mr. goal due to the fact that during the match he decided to drink some water [Music] seeing the approaching team the goalkeeper just froze in one position  here's another athlete who is happy about winning ahead of time [Music]  [Applause] and in this video the driver enters the pit stop too quickly and knocks down several members of his team [Music] in this athlete saw the finish line and just ran to it it did not matter that it was necessary to jump over something [Music]  we now turn to tennis because getting a ball below the belt and this sport is easier than ever [Music] and that is what happens if you do not choose the right bowling ball [Music] leading in a race can overtake the mind and reduce concentration that is exactly what happened to Darya domra Sheva in one of her biathlon races in being first she forgot that this round of shooting is carried out lying down and not standing as a result our five shots did not count  Maria Sharapova despite her professionalism could not hit the ball in the exact place [Music] this lucky player was in front of an empty net there was no one near him who would prevent him from scoring a goal but the athlete sent the puck to the other side and then tried to turn around and fell the opponent sees the moment and scored a goal themselves  [Applause] [Music] and in this footage the ref decided to stop the fight but the fighters were too carried away by the fight and ignored him and continued to fight it's hard to imagine how it would all end because the judge just fell into a rage and already the other judges came running to help the fighters due to a strong push the uniform of Finnish hockey player Tommy Maki got stuck in the gap between the glass panels the athlete could not free himself so the referee and other players came to his aid  in this

low-carb diets succeed While doing after calories does not seem to work The problem with caloric theory is It is really wrong Because we do not yet fully understand the problem of obesity That is why we cannot address it I am sure many of you have watched this program Called 'The Biggest Loser' It is shown in North America, Australia and all over the world And what happens is that there are contestants They battle for weight loss And they are subject to a diet It is a low calorie diet And they do a lot of exercise You saw Gillian and Michael (presenter) screaming at everyone There are a lot of exercises And they don't show it on the screen But in fact, there is a severe reduction in calories as well It is not a low-starch diet It is similar to eating moderation The problem, of course This program is broadcast for a long time There are a number of contestants They went out and said that this system really does not work The reason is that not all of the contestants did so Is that they are under a court order confidential They are not allowed to talk about these topics But some of them have already spoken So this contestant Susan said \"They never filmed an episode where the old contestants gathered.\" \"Why? They have all returned to their previous weight.\" This is not limited to the \"Biggest Loser\" program. Lots of diets We all made these low-calorie diets And they all work the same way It works well for a period of six months but after that The extra weight comes back Weight loss stops Then the weight begins to rise And everyone knows that Because everyone made this diet The question is why? This is what we must understand This is what I mean when I say that we must solve the problem of the two storage compartments in the body I will explain that later Diet The Biggest Loser Program Although we all know it does not work Indeed, it is highly ranked For example, the US News Agency last year Diet put the biggest loser In third place for weight loss And in the eleventh place in general Presumably an excellent diet Why not, which is about The method of eating less and moving more Calculate calories in eating Raise your calorie burn, and you will lose weight That is why it is so common Because all doctors recommended and promoted it ... etc. The problem is There are some scientific studies That were made on these contestants It is scientifically useful to consider What is actually happening To these people They follow a system (eating less more mobile) The Biggest Loser Program, of course It adopts the activation methodology You eat a lot less And it moves a lot more For this you get the results of a large weight loss In a season of seasons They took these contestants They made them sign consent They conducted their metabolism analysis It is interesting At first it looked amazing Of course we all saw that program And the body of the rider before and after is awesome And the study supports that When looking at the analysis before and after And the amount of fat lost In the sixth and thirty weeks At the end of the program week 30 You can see that they lost Really big weight! Here is 60 kg This shows fat mass Most of it is fat They say you will lose muscle No, they generally lose fat A little muscle loss however occurs In general fat This is the percentage of fat in their bodies It goes down steadily The average rate is from 329 pounds to 202 pounds This is a great result, right? Body fat decreased from 49% to 28% At the end of the program, you have great results All people are happy And pretend that everything is fine But we know that it is not why not? what's the problem? Presumably it should work You have to continue doing the program And you will continue to lose weight! But this does not happen The reason is that we know from about a hundred years Your metabolic rate starts to slow This is what happens to the rate of metabolism For all those contestants You can see black dots This is the basis for their metabolic rate Before they start the program And the void points yet And you can actually see that in all cases These people staged By reducing the amount of calories They burn a lot You can look at some surprising examples For example, this person He started burning 3,500 calories a day And here he came down a lot And it reached to burn 1700 calories per day And it's not just that Rather, everyone happens with them If we take the whole group of people The rate of decline in metabolism Over 700 calories per day When you start burning 3,500 calories This is too much Or 2000 calories you will end up 1200 or 1300 by the end of the program Then she is surprised Why not lose more weight! The reason is because your metabolic rate has become much slower If you burn 1,300 calories and eat 1,500 calories Remember this is much less than what you used to eat You will start to regain weight This is exactly what happens and we all know When you feel cold or feel tired Or you feel very hungry And the weight is back and increasing! Here lies the problem We all know the cause of the problem It is a low rate of metabolism You can try and compensate with more exercises This is what they pretend you can do! You can see the baseline Below is the metabolic rate And the amount of exercises During the program, they burn large amounts of calories With exercises as shown above The total energy burned was better But when you stop exercising 5 hours a day! The exercises drop a lot See here what happens to the metabolic rate This is the rate of metabolism during rest It has already decreased from the sixth week Do not blame yourself, this happens all the time In the thirtieth week it fell more and more Here lies the whole problem You get a slow metabolic rate! Because you are not burning enough energy She is not energetic, energetic and feels so bad And you can see that In this graph This is the biggest losers contestant You see the metabolic rate line going down But there is a similar dangerous procedure He doesn't seem to have that problem The question is why? You can look at the process of linking the stomach The process of linking the stomach stapling the stomach The stomach shrank to the size of a nut You cannot eat You cannot eat for months or months In the end, of course, the weight drops This is not new Interestingly, it works to lose weight in the long run Yes, there are a lot of problems accompanying this To be honest I would never recommend it But looking for scientific analysis The rate of metabolism during rest Compared to the similar big procedure It is gradually increasing The question is why? This is another study of the long-term effect For gastric banding, you can see Starting line and after operation later And between them two years Metabolic rate and total energy burnt That is, the amount of energy you burn It never fell Compared to eating less movement more It continued to decline until exhaustion This is of course the sad part It is the worst thing in the whole journey As we know about the nature of the metabolism process Where it was introduced in 1915 And we knew about it 100 years ago It is very painful that we give people bad advice The need to eat less and move more When they fail to lose weight, we also blame them! This is to blame the victim Here the poor or poor person is the victim Because they suffer from obesity or diabetes They are given very bad advice and know that it doesn't work in the long run We all did and know It does not work every time When the weight returns You say to them you do not hear the speech! You do not have the strong will! You are supposed to eat that sandwich! ..Etc of blame This is too bad So we try to pretend our advice is correct And that mistakes are from all others This does not make sense How could it be 40% or 50% of people Morally bankrupt and they let it happen It does not make sense that the advice itself was bad? It is more realistic We will explain why this difference To understand that We have to understand what happens when we eat The level of insulin rises after eating Most foods have a mixture of micronutrients Fats, carbohydrates and protein After eating, insulin rises to varying degrees Insulin is the hormone that gives your body orders to store fat It stops your body from burning fat And you start storing some sugar and fat This is very normal Carbohydrates turn into glycogen These are glucose bonds in the liver It is the form of sugar stored in the body When you have a lot of it The liver produces fat and is a formed fat And stores grease When you do not eat, that is, when you fast, we mean not fasting at all Insulin level drops This is a sign to withdraw some of that stored energy So you start burning some energy from glycogen It is stored sugar It will draw some energy from the stored grease You can imagine glycogen as a coolant It stores food for energy The reason it is likened to a coolant is that it is easily accessible Where you can put food easily And take the food easily As for the grease, imagine it as a freezer You can store a lot of it But it is far in the basement Hard to reach It is difficult to get food out of it Where you prefer to use a coolant We have the same idea You have two energy storage compartments One is easily accessible and the other is hard to reach The disadvantage of the coolant is that it has limited storage capacity If you put a lot of things, you transfer them to the freezer The reason is that calories don't work Is that it works by imposing a single storage compartment Where they claim that All calories enter one body And that all calories are like some They are stored in a large storage compartment Like this basin And when you need energy They are all coming out one way So when you follow this simple false model Where when you reduce calories Reduce your weight And when the extra calories increase The rate increases But the whole hypothesis is the internal and external caloric model Completely void Because we know that this does not happen inside the body The body does not have a large calorie basin In fact, sugar and fat can be stored Not a large tank for calories stored in the liver This is what they claim to be the situation If you had this whole misconception To explain the process, this will not work The best model then is two storage compartments Where there are two places in the body to store food You have a coolant (glycogen) and a freezer (body fat) Calories enter and leave the coolant Because it is easier and faster But there is a third factor that we have to consider It is the amount of food transported from the cooler to the freezer and vice versa Here is the stall of the Persians Where here are the fats, which are the most difficult to reach The question is, what controls this? Where here is the answer It turns out that the main factor is insulin We know this because insulin prevents lipolysis This means that it stops pulling fat out This is his natural mission If you have a lot of insulin Usually after eating a large meal, the insulin rises It will direct the body to store energy in this direction When the insulin is high, you cannot get the energy in the opposite direction This is the problem For example, if you have a lot of insulin resistance It keeps the level of insulin high It is like this freezer in the cellar It is locked behind the iron You can not get it Well what would happen if Begin to cut calories? When you reduce the incoming calories, you cannot get the stored calories Your body will simply reduce the calories out This is already happening Because he will not lose weight to death! This is wrong When we look at the Women's Health Initiative It is a large study of 50 thousand people They reduced women's calorie intake by 350 today For seven years With an estimate that people can lose 30 pounds in the year In seven years, they can lose 210 pounds Of course, this does not happen How much have they lost? Not even a pound Because what happened is that the body does not get stored fat due to insulin blocking You are only cutting calories It should be noted, of course, that we do not violate any thermodynamic laws Inbound and outbound prices Yes, you can count all of those calories But the most important thing is to know where and the process of storing it This is our topic Not the total energy But where to go This is what we want to know When you eat Burning quickly no problem it will be wonderful But when you eat and turn into fat Then we have a problem It is not a question of caloric equivalence When you eat 500 extra calories And your body burns it all no problem You have no additional body fat And when you eat 500 more calories So insulin directs it here And herein lies the problem This is a problem with the two storage compartments When you look at what happens during fasting Everyone worries about this Oh how about protein will burn muscle right? This is a study by Kevin Hull From the National Health Foundation It focused on what happens during fasting This is what happens For the first day of fasting What you see is that carbohydrate burning is going up You burn sugar You can see the fat index not moving for some days You do not burn a lot of fat Then when glycogen runs out Remember that glycogen is an easily accessible energy But limited storage capacity When it burns all Begins to burn fat You are now burning fat for energy And that's cool This is what we want But what happens to protein? Are you burning muscle? of course not It rises slightly at the beginning and then decreases The protein is not considered a stored energy source Why does your body burn energy You hear this discussion all the time Muscles will burn! This is ridiculous You tell me That the way we design our bodies Is to store energy as fat And when necessary we will burn the muscles! OK I do not think so It is like having a wood stove You store firewood In times of need, the sofa will not be broken and burned This is crazy The other funny thing If you have intermittent famine cycles Like a cave man, for example You store fat and burn muscle At the end of the courses You hate 100% fat. This is like what happens to the bear Do not be silly You do not burn muscle Protein Yes you need a quantity of it To maintain fat-free protein But it does not increase and this is what I mean It is not zero There are some of it But it does not increase with fasting A recent reason for fasting and low-carb diets It does well And maybe better than any procedure Is that it deflates that coolant Remember that what you want to do is Get rid of all of that insulin, too Because when there is no insulin, it directs your body to store that energy into fat Now you can withdraw calories in this direction If you have a lot of insulin And we do that sometimes When we give people exhausted insulin They cannot lose weight even if they fast It is very difficult because they cannot reach that fat Just keep cutting calories The point is Fasting provides the easiest way So you get rid of all of that glycogen And you get low insulin and withdraw from body fat Gorgeous The whole issue why not fast? I asked my son for years how can you lose weight? He was six or seven years old at the time He replied, \"Do not eat.\" Simply said it How can you be so wise This point missed 99% of the world's doctors and specialists If you don't eat, you will lose weight We do not understand that there is nothing wrong with it This is our designer for future As well as lions, tigers and bears This is what our body is designed to do Our body is designed to withstand cyclical starvation cycles Where there is no food The cave man has neither McDonald's nor any cooler It takes days for you not to have anything to eat That's why you found fat in your body It is a common myth Fasting puts you in a state of emergency Brother! This is really ridiculous Because the emergency means The metabolism is so low that you will gain weight I heard this in a previous topic And this is exactly what happens when you try to cut calories If you don't do anything about insulin And only calories are reduced Your metabolic rate is decreasing And you are in an emergency situation But what happens during fasting? Is this also happening? OK Here is a study showing four days of continuous fasting This is for a normal person And what we see above is that weight is dropping This is excellent This is what we expected But what happens to your average metabolic rate during rest and this middle streak This is your metabolic streak It does not come down but rises You are burning more energy than before You may ask why This explanation is very logical Imagine again that you are a cave man There is nothing to eat and time is winter If your body starts to emergency You have no chance of getting anything Because you are tired, you can't go fishing You need to sleep You will die this way But your body is not that stupid Your body says if you have nothing to eat I will supply you with energy And increase the amount of energy as well I will pull it out of your stored fats Because you need to go out and eat and refill that store This is exactly what is happening Otherwise, we are not here originally We will be like insects and ants around the world So what happens to the amount of oxygen for consumption This is the amount of oxygen that you burn Is it going down? No, it just goes up Once again You have more ability and energy to do exercises Why is this so? First you are burning fat for energy Your body is happy in it There is a lot of fat why not The other thing is Adrenaline level Your body gives you a boost To maintain your high energy level This is what you need to survive So insulin decreases clearly And your hormones rise And remember that obesity is caused by hormonal imbalance When your hormones rise, they provide you with the ability to burn fat So there is no emergency Quite the opposite You can do something called intermittent fasting It is fasting on and not According to studies, a complete fast is not counted It allows you to eat 500 calories on fasting days It is not considered a fast but the calories are very low and you will get some benefits If you look at the rate of metabolism during rest The first line You can see it from start to day 22 Several weeks of intermittent fasting Low metabolic rate Fat burning rate It increases and rises You burn fat This cannot be questioned You can measure these things, as you burn fat Why? Because you do not have carbohydrates to burn it She ran out of that cooler All the stored sugar has been depleted Fat is burnt and this is excellent This is exactly what you want The second myth: you will burn muscle Repeat and repeat The idea that you will burn protein for energy never happens This has been known scientifically for 20-25 years When looking at urea The long column is here They are proteins broken down in the liver You can see that you secrete an amount of nitrogen every day Also take a quantity of nitrogen every day This is in the normal state As for fasting Where there is no food What happens is that urea is not produced And nothing comes in too What we notice is that you do not burn muscles Because in the event of muscle burning, the level of urea is very high At least equal to this But the truth is your body constantly protects protein And muscle mass This is what happens when fasting You can do 70 days of intermittent fasting 70 days more than two months And what you will see is When measuring the amount of fat and the amount of muscle As in this study you can see The amount of fat decreases well from 43 to 38 And the amount of muscle does not change at all These are some of the myths that are transmitted Emergencies and muscle burning! The worse thing is that they say it is never useful Okay, okay If you don't eat, do you think you will lose weight? in fact yes This is not a debate and debate By saying they will not work! Because it will definitely work I did not say that it is easy This is a second topic And can you do this, it will be long I think most people can do it If you can, then you will definitely lose weight Going back to 1960 Various studies have been conducted on patients Where they put them in the hospital and monitored And you can see that people lost weight This is a response to those who say women are not supposed to fast why not? Do you think you won't lose weight? You will even lose If you are under a healthy weight, then you are not supposed to fast He will be in health problems for you But if you need to lose weight, yes you will lose This is exactly what these studies have proven Men lose weight Women also lose weight We can see that the weight loss is stable and continuous There are no twists and turns This is the problem of fastness and weight recovery Fasting has many advantages and benefits There is no other system Where other diets dictate what to do Fasting is the opposite, something you should not do One of the biggest benefits of fasting It is very simple It can be explained in two minutes And everyone understands the crux of the matter Yes, there are differences There is fasting on fats, juice fasting, water fasting, and dry fasting All of these are different types But the common denominator is ease of understanding This is important when people do not understand it They can not do Another advantage is that it is free and available As you know, I always want home meals And get the well-cooked meat broth Actually Most of us do not have time, desire or money For example, if you wanted to eat meat fed with the plant every day It will cost you a lot as well as organic products I do not mean a legacy but it is expensive and some of us do not have money Send me people from the Philippines Saying we have all these things but I can't afford it OK Fasting costs nothing The third feature is that it fits all You can cook whatever you want but it takes time Sometimes we don't have time Fasting requires no shopping, preparation, cooking, cleaning, or even eating! Really nothing Perfect fit The idea is not what to do You just have to avoid it And here lies the difference It is something that you can include The third feature is flexibility It is not like saying you should eat six times a day Sometimes you don't want to eat six times a day Maybe busy But fasting gives you more time You can do it from anywhere You can do it tomorrow Or leave it all next week Then go back and do it You can do whatever you want It is completely flexible You can do 12 hours or 12 days no problem The idea is that you can add it to any diet Because it is very flexible According to your need Let's say you want to follow a rice diet or something You can still fast with it This is the significance If you don't eat meat, you can still fast If you do not eat wheat You can still fast You are allergic to food You can still fast Don't have enough time? You can still fast Don't have money? You can still fast You commute all day You can still fast You do not cook You can still fast And most importantly It has unlimited power Sometimes as a doctor you want to do something But he is not strong enough Keep fasting until you get the results you want As you said if you need, you will lose weight It is impossible that you do not lose weight Can you continue? This is another topic I will not say it is easy Or, you do not need health monitoring Especially if you are being treated with medication But you can start it A person aged 75 years I finish 30 days fast And feel the best World record It is 382 days You can continue The whole idea is that fasting gives you open options Because it is not a diet Not a system Like actor George Castanza, he talks and talks about nothing It gives you power and freedom We are free from all these restrictions We now have all these health problems in the world The main ones are heart attacks, cancer, strokes, diabetes and kidney disease And all of them are due to obesity and diabetes Yes, we have the power to free ourselves Of all these modern diseases Only by applying a method known 5,000 years ago! The ancient Greeks used to practice fasting completely Not for health purposes as obesity was not present at the time But for the benefits of potential energy and complete mental focus After the time of hunger, civilization and food abundance began Religions came later and began to enter periods of fasting When you look at any of the major religions in the world They have fasting periods Celebration periods, too But it is balanced with periods of fasting Religions do not try to kill all religious and followers Not like saying fasting until you die hahaha .. no never They command fasting because there is something essential and useful in fasting It is evident Fasting cleanses the body and cleanses The common thing among the leaders of the three religions throughout history They agreed on its benefit The Prophet Muhammad, Jesus and the Buddha They all agreed to one thing It is that fasting is very beneficial It is especially useful Not only for the spiritual side but for the physical side We need to clean our bodies of these accumulated waste Excess sugar and fat need to be cleaned from time to time Just like cleaning the spring completely By applying the remaining ancient method through the ages We can break free from all of that In the last century, we got rid of many incurable diseases But we have these diseases of the age But we have the method and knowledge, but we should only apply it This is ironic that we do not fast without reason Where everyone repeats and repeats that we have to fast Why not fast? Even my little son deduced the truism thank you", "OC_6WqXA1ps": "Clemson had a pretty good day too didn't they? And South Carolina didn't lose as bad as they were supposed to so it was a pretty good day all the way around. Let's pray. Lord, we thank you. Father as a group we now do what your word says we come boldly before your throne with our petitions. Father you know I can do these talks by myself, but they sure are better when you do them. So we just ask you invade this time and you own this time and you redeem this time with your spirit. In Jesus name, Amen. How many of you grew up like I did: not rich? I grew up in Antioch, Tennessee a suburb of Nashville and it was not the poor end of town but it sure wasn't the rich end of town. Just workin folk, you know what I'm talking about. My dad thought work was a verb, he didn't think it was management theory. So when we went off to college while was going through four years of school we worked 40 to 60 hours a week some of y'all worked when you were in college. How many of y'all worked when you were in college? You know what I'm talking about. And none of you died from it, the ones that died aren't here so... These days they call that child abuse, you ask your kid to work in college you know. Little Jimmy, Little Jimmy needs to study. Little Jimmy's playing beer pong he needs a job. So that's how I grew up and so, Sharon and I, my wife and I we meet, we get married, we start off with nothing. How many of y'all started off with nothing? You remember we ain't got money honey but we got love. Good thing too because we ain't got any money. We were eating off a card table, driving in 1902 Pinto. For you young people that's a car, not a bean. And we got married, set up our first little apartment with two nickels to rub together, and we'd been married about a month and my wife remembers that she's a Baptist. She neglected to tell me this when we were dating. Never came up. But apparently there's a doctrinal thing once your a Baptist your always a Baptist or something I don't know what the deal is, but so she gets up on Sunday morning and says we're going to church and I said we aren't doing anything I'll be here drinking beer and watching football and um course she cried and I'm like I don't understand we never talked about this before and all the sudden you just, you know, you're a super Baptist. What's the deal? But um, so she takes off to church and and then every Sunday she crying go to church and these little heathen or she'd go to these little Baptist churches and they would pray for her heathen husband and um, so then I got into this multi-level thing that I was in for about 10 years one 3 month period. and uh, you know one of those deals where you make your friends are mad you know that deal. and so um anyway so I was gonna get rich me and one of my beer drinking buddies, there's a lot of beer in the story, but um and so we me and this little redneck guy that I was friends with me, two little rednecks trying to figure out how to be how to get rich in this business and so you know we were out there trying to do sales calls and we couldn't get anything to work and we had five questions and we just knew if we can get these five questions answered we could you know be one of those rich people in an MLM and we'd be having a yacht and all this kind of stuff and you know how they do that stuff and so we went to one of their pep rally things you know the big thing in the convention center and they have all the guys that are successful gals are successful get up on the stage and tell you how much money they're making and I'm making $800,000 a minute or whatever you know that stuff right. And they've all got big checks. I never got a big check like that, I wonder if you can get that at the bank or not but you know they've all got this stuff and so we finally at the end of the day the last guy to come up I kid you not his name was Rich. You can't make this up okay and so he was the guy we wanted to see cause he was the big dog right and then when he got up there he was even cooler than we thought and so he owned us you know I mean like credibility city and on top of that his talk it was like he had our five questions as his outline he went right down them man we're like this guy he knows everything this is the smartest guy on the planet and then he goes he gets tto he end of his talking he goes and there's one more thing, and we went no there's not we got them it's five you know and he goes no there's one more thing if you don't know God, you're going to struggle in business. And my buddy and I went \"Say what?!\" And he said when you put on the character of Christ it changes your character, it causes you to want to serve rather than to take, and you're more worthy of trust you're more trustworthy and servants have a tendency to win in business more than and so if you don't know God you're going to struggle in business he does this whole talk about God. And my buddy and I are going I never heard anything like that before in my life. So you know we go back, two little redneck guys, we go back to the like the Hampton Inn or whatever wherever we were staying and we get out the Gideon's Bible and it's Old King James. So it's like Shakespeare and Jesus, right? These and thous and thou and this and I'm like there's no possible way these two guys are gonna figure this out, right. So we sit there and look at it for a few minutes and like I have no idea. We closed it. But I did go home I told my wife I said we're going to church and she said who are you and what have you done with my husband? And so we visited a couple churches and one guys asleep in one of them and I'm like well if there's a Jesus you shouldn't be asleep about it so um you ought to be like excited. I like going to churches like this where we're having fun y'all know what I'm talking about? I mean sometimes you're going these places and they look like they're weaned on a pickle you know I mean its life is bad you know and so anyway this place they you know want people raising their hands like they knew the answer to a question or something and you know and one woman's up there swaying and I'm like I told Sharon we were sitting on the back and tell us if they get out snakes were leaving. And uh, so pretty soon you know we're walking through the backdoor the place and meet the pastor and his wife was one of those sweet sweet ladies and she just give everybody a hug that was there and you know week after week month after month we kept going and that woman literally hugged us into the kingdom. And we met Jesus there and it changed the trajectory of my life. It changed everything and I started we of course left that whole multi-level thing I told you just for three months and so we started buying and selling real estate um I grew up in the real estate business momma and daddy were in the real estate business So I knew the real estate business and I'm start doing flip this house before there's cable TV to tell you how right and so you know we're buying and selling houses and we got rich. By the time I was 26 years old I had four million dollars worth of real estate little over a million dollar net worth and twenty-five was my best year in that business i made $250,000 cash taxable income that year, that's twenty thousand dollars a month. I don't know what neighborhood you grew up in the neighborhood I grew up and we call that rich. And it was fun too. I had that car I always wanted, you got that car you always wanted some day when I make it I'll get that car you know that one for me it was a Jaguar I needed a Jaguar because nobody in the neighborhood I grew up in could spell Jaguar right, and so I got me a Jaguar man you know I'm riding along and within 90 days baby I was a Jaguar right you know right right oh man I was having fun and Sharon and I we went to Hawaii and we liked it so we went back. She likes little sparkly things we got her some. They weren't big enough so we got her some more. It was fun. Sometimes I hear these people say \"All those rich people are miserable.\" Uh-huh. Now I'm not theologically or philosophically shallow enough to tell you money will make you happy. Money will not make you happy. You get more money it will, it will make you more of what you are right now. If you are miserable and you get money, you will be lots of miserable. If you're a jerk and you get money, big jerk. And and it will mess with your family too to the extent there's crazy in your family, and we all got crazy in our family right? You know, if you don't think you got crazy in your family, it's you. Okay. So everybody's got something, right? And you put a little money on the crazy woohooo crazy gets crazy! Y'all know what I'm talking about? Is this real? So your money is not gonna solve your problems it's going to make them bigger. It's also gonna make your opportunities bigger if you're a generous person your generosity will go into overdrive. You'll be outrageously generous. To the and you get a lot of money we'll call you a philanthropist. Cool word that means you give a lot of it away and you have a blast doing it. You found the most fun you'll ever have with money is when you find that. So you know it was it was fun you guys but I did stupid stuff. How many of y'all ever done somethin stupid? How many of you didn't raise your hand and have a problem with lying? What do you think this is a rhetorical question? I mean seriously? I borrowed too much money, and our bank got sold to another bank out-of-state. I know that never happens around here. And a guy looked down sitting in another state and said there's a 26 year old kid in Nashville owes us a million two hundred thousand and he's flipping houses, we need to limit this relationship. Which is banker talk for ruin his life. And they called our notes. We weren't late, but they were 90 day notes so they had the option of doing that. They just said we don\\'t want to play anymore and I went, \"What?!\" That started a crash that took took two and a half years to unfold and we lost everything we owned. We were sued, we were, we were sued so many times. And they were all right I mean I made $250,000 one year, the next year my taxable income was 6,000. I spent the whole year selling stuff trying to pay my bills and trying to honor those things that I signed and I couldn't do it. Cause stupid will catch you and tackle you and I had signed up for stupid on steroids. I've done I mean I got a PhD in D.U.M.B. y'all. I mean. We were sued so much that the little guy with the Sheriff's Department that brings those little pink lawsuit papers we're like on a first-name basis with the old boy. Sharon's making him cookies, you know come on Harold. I mean, it's not his fault bless his heart, what a job you know oh man and-and-and. We had a brand-new baby and a toddler, and our marriage is hanging on by a thread. Y'all I was so scared I didn't know what to do. I remember standing in the shower with it so hot in my face I could just barely stand there and I would just stand there and cry. I was so scared. 28 years old I got babies, my poor wife. She thought she married Sir Galahad turns out it was Goober. I mean I had missed it up y'all, I drove  NASCAR into the wall engines up in the stands I mean it's it was a blow-up. I mean we didn't get a divorce I mean number one cause of divorce in North America today money fights and money problems y'all know you have a good money fight but if your a hillbilly and you have a good money fight it's real fight. I mean we didn't get a divorce shall we held on to each other but sometimes it's to get a better grip you know what I'm saying and I mean she's from the hills of East Tennessee frying pan throwing there is an Olympic event. You know it's like man and finally we hit bottom and we were bankrupt. I was doing one of these new shows the other day I do these Fox and Friends and Good Morning America stuff and one of those news anchors is like \"You know this is a cool story you start with nothing you become a millionaire you lost everything know your multi-millionaire how did you bounce back?\" I went dude when you fall that far you really don\\'t bounce. It was more of a splat. I said I'd like to tell you bounce back but I didn't I set around whined and blamed everybody else. You ever do something stupid and blame everybody somebody else? Yeah. Turns out McDonalds does serve hot coffee, you know. It's like, man. We live in a, we live in a culture of victims don't we it's unbelievable and so victims of our own stupidity all of us it's unbelievable. And so man I sat around whined. But, I tell you this: you know I met God as I told you on the way up but I got to know him on the way down. And you I mean we were ground into powder there was nothing left. We had a I surrender all moment and it wasn't about this Baptist altar call baby I mean we surrendered. White flag. You're in charge. What do you want us to do? Because I didn't know how to be a husband. I didn't know how to be a dad. I didn't know how to handle money, obviously. I had a degree in finance, but I got to thinking about it who was it taught me to borrow money this was my finance professor in college who was broke. Know what's wrong with that picture? It's like a shop teacher with missing fingers. So you know I mean so we get this thing out and it turns out my Heavenly Father even in spite of my stupidity is crazy about me. Even in spite of my black heart he's crazy about me. Even in spite of my darkness and the worst Dave that there is he knows him, he still loves him. He's crazy about me. And he's got a plan and it's not to bring me harm. But to bring me hope. And so I dove in here hard. And I'm like okay how do you be married? Submit yourselves one to another. Oh no I gotta dry dishes. Now don\\'t spare the rod, my kid\\'s like \"What\\'s that Dad?\" Come here baby I\\'ll show you. 2,500 scriptures on how to handle money and possessions. And I started reading people like Ron Blue and Larry Burkett and Howard Dayton who were the first guys in the Christian space in the modern era to talk about what the Bible says about money and I was amazed and I started living Sharon and I started living by those principles and they started working. Now I won't tell you it was instant, it was not instant. If you're looking for instant if you want get-rich-quick, God is not in the microwave business he's a crockpot guy. It's gonna take t-i-m-e time, time. But man when you start living your life this way this is a compass it shows you which ways North and you're not lost anymore. I don't always like what it says but it's usually because i'm wrong, hello. I don't know if I agree with what, with God? [laughing] Yeah right. I had a spiritual moment when I realized God was smarter than me you know. Ok i'm probably going to do it this way because it's working. All these years later it does work and not only did Sharon and I get back on our feet gradually and slowly and start building wealth again, because you know we live in a cause-and-effect world what you plant you will harvest you will reap what you sow, right? So if you plant stupid you will get a crop of desperate. I've done it and you know if you plant corn don't be looking for beans to come up. Don't be shocked by, cause what you put into your life is what you're going to get out. God is real clear, it's all through Scripture, it's a cause-effect the whole thing you know the cause effect the theorem of cause and effect was you know a Christian physicist that discovered the Christian worldview and so you start to understand that that's how the universe works and our lives are the same way and yet we live them randomly. And we go I wonder how that happened? Well you know you planted it six months ago and it grew up and smacked you in the back of the head and that's what happens in our lives isn't it? This is real. So, we start teaching a little Sunday School class had about 30 people in there. And then we looked up there's about 500 in there. And we took a little book and printed it and nobody would buy it and I was selling it out of the trunk of my car in a video store, bookstores wouldn't carry it. And finally some bookstores started carrying it, and then publishers wanted to publish it, and then all these you know 12 million books later here we are, you know. We start teaching a little class called Financial Peace University and with a bad suit and an overhead projector and now all these years later four-and-a-half million families have gone through it and forty thousand churches. I mean God really knows how to take lemons and make lemonade, doesn't He? He knows how to take something and turn it around. So if your life's in a mess I'm here to tell you I got mess down. I know what mess looks like and we serve a God who cleans up messes and seals broken hearts and touches wounds and and turns things around. And if you're too cool for school you're smart oh He'll get to you. He'll help you He'll help you course-correct and knock the hair off your head I'll tell you that but He'll course-correct you. Because He loves you He's crazy about you. So we found that there's five things that if you do these five things with money over a period of time like 10 or 15 years you will build a level of wealth one hundred percent of the time. And now I said a level of wealth I don't know what level because I can't predict car wrecks and cancer, I can't predict tragedy and I don't know what your income will be. But if you're working and you do these five things, you will build a level of wealth one hundred percent of the time. And this is not some prosperity thing and it's not mystical magical when I cover these five things, they're all common sense. But common sense is so rare now it's like having a superpower. So when you plug God's common sense and it changes everything. So let's look at the five the first one is get on a budget. A written plan. Jesus said for which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost lest to get halfway up and is unable to finish and all who see him begin to mock him and say this man began to build and was unable to finish. Another Christian they can't pay their bills. I added that last part. You have to do a budget. On paper. On purpose. Before the month begins, every month. If you work for a company called you incorporated and you manage money for you incorporated the way you manage money for you now would you fire you, don't answer that. And you know we misbehave with money the Bible says he who is impulsive exalts folly, folly is the verb of a fool in action he who is impulsive is a fool in action. Been there done that. Arrow right here. And fools you don't want to be a biblical fool. This is not a greeting like \"Hey fool\" no this is like an idiot. You don't want to be that kind of fool. And so we're disorganized, we don't have a plan, nothing's written down, and we have the unmitigated gall to pray to our Heavenly Father the maker of Heaven and Earth and say Lord I'm misbehaving, I'm horrible, and I'm incompetent, but send me more money. To which he looks at us and says, \"No.\" It\\'s in the Bible. Parable of the talents. Master gives three servants an amount of money to manage. Comes back later, two of them managed it well, one of them didn't. The one that didn't he not only didn't give him more, he took the money away from him who managed poorly and gave it to the one that had the most. Who had managed at the best. And then there's that wealth inequality scripture. Hahaha. That says right after that those who are faithful in the little things will be given more to manage. And so my son who's 15 years old many years ago decides he wants a brand-new Corvette when he turns 16. To which I looked at him and I said I'm a loving Heavenly Father, except I'm not heavenly, I'm a loving father. No, you cannot have a new Corvette. Although that sounds like a blessing to you my son It's 465 horsepower, it has a fiberglass body, it will go from zero to 60 in 3.1 seconds, you are incompetent as a driver I've seen you drive you will kill yourself. And until you prove your competence we're not even going to talk about something that ridiculous. So right now what you will get is an old Chevette with a tired gerbil under the hood. Because I remember when I was 16 my first car by the time I got rid of it it had been hit on all eight sides. Be faithful in the little things, decide. The interesting thing about each one of these principles is, you can just decide today to do them. Had a guy working for me and he was not doing his process right and I sat down and I said this is what you need to do and he goes well I it's not the way I do it and I said change. And he said well I'm not like you and I said change. You can decide today to be good at this, or leave. Change. Change. You can decide when you go home, you can decide to do a budget today. Get out a yellow pad or go free budget online every dollar com you can decide today. I'm gonna start managing money well today. Today. You can decide. Because you're going to keep getting what you've been getting if you keep doing what you've been doing, you know this right? Sowing and reaping. And the second one is you need to get out of debt. Now we know this one. You knew Dave Ramsey was going to talk about getting out of debt. Because you know the Bible says the borrower is slave to the lender. It's real. Now the Bible does not say that debt is a Salvation issue. You can have a MasterCard and go to heaven. The Bible does not say debt is a sin. I can't find that in there. But I have studied this for 30-plus years and I cannot find a single scripture anywhere that God used debt to bless his people or a single scripture anywhere that says anything positive about debt. It always says you're a fool, it's a curse, you're a slave, and then we continue to engage in it and in our intellectual minds we somehow figured out how we are smarter than God. While all through the Bible it basically says debt is stupid. And those that engage in stupid things are, well, stupid. And I've been stupid I told you that so I'm not calling you names. Here's the deal the borrower is slave to the lender. You don't think this is so? Think about this: your most powerful wealth building tool is your income. Let me show you what slavery looks like. This week they came out with new data that shows that the average car payment in America today according to National Auto Dealers association is 499 dollars. That's dangerously close to 500. You take 500 bucks a month and invest it from age 30 to age 70 in a decent growth stock mutual fund, You'll have 5.6 million dollars. That's what a car payment costs you. So who'd you make rich? General Motors? Ford? Lexus? I don't know who was it? You made somebody rich. It wasn't you. And you driving along in something you can't afford scratching your head, wondering why your kids college fund isn't funded. Because we're giving it all to somebody else. And they have nicer furniture in their building, have you noticed? Something's going on here guys. You know and some people in here got a student loan's been around so long you think it's a pet. You got Master card in your life. I mean it's hard to be a slave if you don't have a Master so you might as well. We've discovered bondage. And American distress. And just keeps going and going and have done it to y'all, I'm not picking on anybody I'm just saying here's the deal think about this what if you had no payments? Can't even get my head around that. Well you're always gonna have a car payment, you ever hear people say that? Little man can't get ahead, you're always going to have a car payment so drive something nice, YOLO. Right? Which by the way is addressed in Proverbs. Says fool right after that. See this is how we talk when we're losing. You know we can't get ahead I sure hope we can elect a president who will fix my life. Not gonna happen. Neither one of them got the goods I'll just tell you. You're in charge of your life and you and Jesus I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me are the only shot you got it's the only one is gonna work and that's what changes. Don't be listening to these people little man can't get ahead you talk to these people you think their spirit animal is Eeyore. It's unbelievable. So how do you get out of debt? Well you have to decide to not borrow any more that's first step, isn't it? I have we had plastic surgery at our house, we had a plastectomy. Decided we're not borrowing money anymore. MasterCard Capital One. What's in your wallet? Money. You're weird Dave. You're right, and I'm not broke anymore either. I decided I'm not living like this. I haven't had a credit card in 30 years. You don't have a credit card?! I don't have a credit card. That's my wallet. Got green President's faces. And it's got four pieces of, [applause] thank you, it's got four pieces of plastic in here. Two debit cards, one on my business, one on my personal account, which will do everything your stupid credit card will do. I travel more than any two of you put together shut up it works ok. Dave you're not getting the airline miles yeah I've met a lot of millionaires and none of them said Dave I made it all on my airline miles, I haven't heard that one so. So I got four pieces of plastic in here these two debit cards my driver's license in my handgun carry permit. I said that in California about got arrested. It's good to be back in America. Um They just don't speak Southern over there it's not good for me. And the third thing once you're out of debt then, you need to be careful to foster high quality relationships. What's that got to do with money? Everything. There's a huge correlation for those that build wealth and who they hang around with. Because you become who you hang around with have you noticed that? You do! I mean I was in Boston thursday night doing an event you know those people all have an accent? You become who you hang around with you don't let your kids hang around with little juvenile delinquents right? If little Johnny down the streets a weed head you don't let your kid run with little Johnny because you know you're gonna have a weed head in your house right? You know we know this. So you know they come home with that mouth on them and you're going where'd you learn that? That'll get you knocked into next week in this house I mean what or do you think you could do you get away with that? I'll take you out and make another one looks just like you you know I mean you know. It's cause they're hanging out a little Johnny right you know what happens we're the same way y'all. We're the same way. You talk like the people you hang around with you, you read the books they talk about, you know if you don't read and all your friends watch The Bachelor well here's a clue okay here's what's going on if this is all you know about is reality TV that's not a reality probably we need to change our diet you know and you don't read a book and so Charlie tremendous Jones said five years from today you'll be the same person you are today except for the books you read the people you meet. I mean don't be deceived evil company corrupts good habits and you know this the studies have shown that over a 10-year period of time that your income will approximate will become within ten to twenty percent of the average of your 10 closest friends income. Because you have the same habits they've got the same diet into your self that they've got if you want to learn scripture hang out with people that know scripture and are memorizing scripture you want to have a filthy mouth hang out with people with a filthy mouth you'll have it you can't stop yourself from doing it you will become who you hang around with and all the studies show that we have a tendency now that's not to say I'm some kind of snob and I don't have any friends aren't rich friends not that at all I have lots of friends but my closest hangs are people I want to be like that's my closest ones now I'll talk to anybody but like when our daughters were you know our daughters are growing up they're grown and married two wonderful men now but you know they're in high school and they're wanting to go on a date we didn't do missionary dating you don't get the date little Johnny the weed head and lead him to Jesus that's not gonna work okay we're not doing this little johnny can go to camp and get saved again you know we'll work on this right and so no uh-huh you come up in our house pick up one of our daughters honk your horn you better be delivering pizza alright so coming in talking to the old man you know be cleaning my gun when you get home you know the song right and so I mean this is kind of thing i'm teaching dad all the boys and youth group are scared of you good good keeps away two things you don't want baby doll you don't want jerks and you don't want wusses and if I can keep both those away and then I teach you how to keep them away you can pick good. And guess what they both picked good they both picked good they're married studs man i got some son-in-law unbelievable love Jesus love their wife love their kids I mean fight for their family I got man my sons in law are awesome it was an accident started praying for my sons-in-law when my daughters were born and praying still praying for my son's wife because he hadn't found her but he'll get around to it and you know but the you see what I'm saying y'all and you become who you hang around with and you need to make these choices very very carefully the third thing or the fourth thing is you need to save and invest. In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil wise people save money that's what this means oil is a sign of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament it was used to anoint kings and it was used to keep the oil burning in the Holy of Holies and so it was used in the marketplace like we use green president's faces as a medium of exchange if you had a carafe of oil you were ready to do business it was a sign of wealth there were two classes of people poor people and rich people most of the people were poor people this is the Mediterranean we're talking they ate hummus and olives no meat a little bit of bread maybe maybe a fish if they got some meat but that was it rich people ate what we eat every day spices good meat Charleston food scene you know what I'm saying right cooking it up right you know what I'm saying that that's fine food stores of choice food and oil food choice food and oil are symbols of wealth so let's read that again in the house of the wise are stores of money wise people save money why well start with we say for an emergency right grandma said she said save for a what rainy day visual aid it's gonna rain it's gonna rain you're gonna have a car wreck you're gonna lose your job something's gonna happen you're gonna need some money Dave you need to be positive I'm positive it's gonna rain something's gonna come up this one I don't understand unexpected pregnancy say what? ok but people come up with all kinds of things that are emergencies right and something's gonna happen and then you need to save an invest so you retire with dignity you know I'm gonna spend everything i make and hope the government which is well known for its ability to handle money will take care of me dumb idea they can't find I mean that they don't i'm not even sure some of them have opposable thumbs up there you know I'm saying it's just ridiculous and we're counting on them and some whacked-out kind of way to come be that they're not coming there is no white horse there is no Calvary your it you and me and Jesus ok you are in charge of your destiny and that's great news it's great news and so I'm all worried about the election and I'm not worried about the election because I've made money under both parties turns out it wasn't up to them in either case I've lost money under both parties none of them sent me a check they all just want money they're extracting like a tick extracting blood all the time that's all they do this is the deal so in the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil by the way the rest of that one says and a foolish man devours all he has if you spend everything you make the Bible just called you a fool again I've been a fool call me a fool too and I decided to change the last one is this God loves a cheerful Giver he loves a cheerful Giver and this is all about generosity oh yes it's about the tithe the tithe to your local church you're an evangelical Christian yes tithe to your local church absolutely that's a baseline that's a starting point but this is all about cheerfulness it's about your generosity is not just a transfer of funds generosity is a spirit where you decide to be a generous person generous people are more attractive they smile they are not grouchy it's not all about them they're the ones that open the door they're the ones when the grocery bag has the bottom dropped and your groceries are rolling all over the parking lot they're the ones out there helping you pick it up these are the people that when they go out to eat after church they leave a tip you cheap Christians servers don't want even waht to work on sunday because of us ridiculous well us i'm not I leave big tips big tips because it's a form of generosity when they didn't give me good service oh shut up carrying a tray that weighs more than you. Figure it out. They parked your car in the rain and the heat shut up give him some money.

thinks it's a to this lightly okay probably a four to him okay now he's no truck no I know the trick already you don't need them to be fairly easy for you  there you are you may just be making a heart fund a secret talk bag I found it yeah Magnus brought it anyway so why did it drop their eyes okay think of a shoulder press and a yeah push-pull Tom it's a lat pull down with the left one dumbbell

from the line it's try [Music] okay Wow he was a difficulty rating for that do you remember when I first try this know if you didn't reach then it was a ten for sure but I've been training like two days it's like full training just on the work wall so now I feel like I I'm much better at it so now I would give it it like a six or seven six or seven okay skipping it what even sure I don't think people that are watching this video and me filming this looking at the screen behind the camera you don't really appreciate it until they see it and her next to it in person see now I think we should try it you have that happen oh there we go you just move the line okay all right Magnus now we've increased the difficulty from a six or seven to a 7 or an 8 maybe  [Music] Oh  [Music]  yeah tried to reach [Music] how you doing that are you starting on your jumping leg if is if you would be sprinting like if you're starting a sprint or how and me personally yeah I thought out on my right so I'll go right right yeah and then I'll go for it is that the line okay so you jump off your way mm-hmm okay okay and that's the usual jumping leg say if you were jumping off one leg you would do your right feet whatever foot touches first cuz I'm so used to it I'll just go straight into it but typically my right leg touches first okay well I learned something today this is a lot harder when you don't have as much of a run-up oh yeah I just don't I'm not used to it but I'm just kind of I'm just constantly worried about this so for me about I would say five yeah I would be better at this if I just did it more okay can we just make up names for this what's called it's called the the spinning flywheel Mad Max is revenge so the big one [Music]  it's my face I think it probably got before I could

you're at you're a pro magnet  [Music] okay oh gosh I know it was easier than it looked so I'd say four to five maybe a little bit harder than the first one this thing is offensive the closest trampoline man I feel a little like someone messed up the sims in here oh [Music] wow Tom Lachey good good leg kicks wow this is pretty dangerous actually this organisation ninja class located in the Atlanta area opening oftentimes 4 to 6 6 to 8 4 open gyms this establishment is not great but I really do love it now wish you guys would come here  [Music] did you take your head  rhetoric [Music] I

(Laughter) Also, he is a liar on your left. Even the one sitting in your chair has such an epithet. We are all liars. What I'm going to do today is to tell you why recent studies make us all liars how to become a liar and why you might want to seek the truth even more passing from a liar's catch to a single seeker of truth and finally create what is called faith. And to talk about faith, since I wrote the book \"Liespotting,\" no one wants to meet me in person, no no no no no no. They say \"No problem, send it by email.\" (Laughter) I can't even drink a cup of coffee at Starbuck. My husband says \"Hey honey, any trick? Perhaps it would have been better to focus on cooking. How do you think about cooking French food? \" So before I get started, what will I do is that I will make my intent clear that is not about learning any game. Cheaters are not just spoiled kids, that at the bottom of the room shout \"Gotcha, Gotcha\" Your eyebrow rises immediately. You're touched where you shouldn't. I watch that TV show \"Lie to me\" or \"I know you\\'re lying\". No, the rogues are armed with a great scientific knowledge on how to best deceive They use deception to quickly get to the truth and do exactly what the world leaders do every day; they have difficult conversations with difficult people often even in difficult times. And so they embark on this journey accepting an important proposal which is: Lie is an act of cooperation. Think little, no lies at all, whatever the way of speech and speech. Her \"power\" landed only when someone else agrees to believe the lie. I know I can sound like a tough love, but, if ever you were the lying side happened because you agreed to be like that. The first rule about lying: Lie is a cooperative act. Now, not all lies are harmful. Sometimes, unconsciously, we are ready to partake in deception for the interest of social dignity, just for the reason of keeping it a secret. We say, \"Good song.\" \"Heart, you don\\'t look healthy under it, no\" Or say, this is my favorite, \"You know what, I just deleted that email from the spam folder. I\\'m sorry.\" But there are also times when we want to be part of the trick. And that can cost us drastically. Last year, $ 991 billion in damages were recorded only from corporate fraud in America. That's only a small fraction under a trillion dollars. That makes up about seven percent of total revenue. This is an example of where fraud can cost billions. Consider the case of Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like the cases of Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, when the lie can even betray our state can compromise security and undermine the development of democracy, they can cause the death of those who protect us Cheating is really a serious topic This jerk, Henry Oberlander, was an effective diploma rogue. British authorities say he could be the man who has damaged the entire Western banking system. And you can't find this person on Google, you can't find it anywhere. He had once interviewed her, and said: \"Look, I\\'ve got a rule.\" And that was Henry's rule, he said, \"Look, everyone is ready to give you something. They are ready to give you something for whatever you are eager to have. \" And this is the essence. If you don't want to be fooled, you should know what are you eager for? This is the fact that we are inclined to admit it. We would like to be better husbands, better wives, smarter, with more power, longer, richer and the list goes on indefinitely. The lie is an attempt to fill this void a way to connect our desires and fantasies about what we would like to be, and how we would like to be, with who we really are. And it is absurd if we want to fill these gaps with lies and lies These days, some studies have concluded that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times. You know, most of these are white lies. But in another study, aliens are said to lie more than three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. (Laughter) And when we first hear this data, we are drawn to it. We can't believe how much lies prevail everywhere. In essence we are all against it. But if you look a little deeper the plot just thickens. We lie to strangers more than our peers. Living people lie more than those who are less socialized. Men lie eight times more about themselves than for others. As women lie more to protect others. If you're a middle-aged married couple, you will find the partner in one of 10 different cases. Now you may think this is wrong. And while you are unmarried, the number goes to three. The lie is complex. It is fabricated in the factory of our daily, private and personal lives. We are deeply frustrated by this reality. We have even introduced the lie as a necessary daily basis, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes only because we do not understand the spaces of our lives. This is the second bitter truth about the lie. We are against lying, but we are secretly in favor of it in the ways that our society has condemned for centuries and for centuries and centuries. The lie is as old as the breathing of mankind. It's part of our culture, of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare, Bible, World News. (Laughter) Lie has a lot of value for us as human beings. Searchers have great knowledge the more intelligent the species, the more brains they have, the more apt they are to cheat and lie. Now you can remember Kokon. Is there anyone who remembers Coconut, Coco, gorillas being taught sign language? Koko was trained to communicate with sign language. Here is Koko with her kitten. It's her charming kitty, full of fur. Koko once blamed her kitten for problems with the gloss of the sink by its wall. (Laughter) We are well-trained to be the leaders of a package. And it starts very early in time How long? Babies will pretend to cry, will pause, to see who is appearing and then they will come back and cry again. One year olds learn these puzzling secrets. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. The five-year-olds lie like this, completely straightforward. They manipulate through jokes. Nine-year-olds are experts at hiding the consequences of actions. By the time you enter high school you will find under one of the nine possible cases. And the moment we step into the job of being a family keeper we enter different distributed worlds with fake digital friends, media of party bias, clever identity thieves, bank failures like that Ponzi Schemers, an epidemic trick - in short, as one author calls it a post-reality society. It has been very confusing for a long time. What are you doing? Well, there are some measures we can take to brighten our way. Liquid detectives are trained and come to the truth in 90 percent of cases. The rest of us are ourselves 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars, and bad liars. But there are no original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques. So what will I do is that I'm going to show you two patterns of cheating. And then we'll look at and analyze them, and find the features for ourselves. Let's start with the speech. (Video) Bill Clinton: I want you all to hear me. And I'll say it again I haven't had sex with that wife, Mrs. Lewinsky. Never like I told someone to lie, never single, never. And these accusations are all false I need to get back to work for the American people Thank you. Pamela Meyer: OK, what were the talkative signs? Well first we heard what it means non-protocol denial. Studies show that people are very predictive of their denials will use the official language rather than the informal one. We also heard a little about the distant phrase \"that woman.\" We know that liars irresponsibly distance themselves by their subject using language as a powerful weapon. Now, if Bill Clinton had said \"Well, I\\'m right ...\" or the famous Richard Nixon, \"With All Sincerity ....\" he would be a dead bypass for every liar I know that qualified language, as it is called, if it so qualifies further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated the question completely, or if he had filled his account with a small detail - and we're all glad he didn't - he would have hidden himself further. Freud had his rights. Freud said, look, there is more than one speech here: \"No mortal man can keep a secret. If the lips don\\'t speak, he speaks with his fingers. \" And we all do it, no matter the power. We all deal with fingerprints I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss Kahn with Obama which are being agreed upon by fingerprints. (Laughter) Now this brings us to another model, which is body language. With body language, that's what we should do. You just have to throw your assumptions out the door. Let science have a little patience with your knowledge. Because we think liars play all the time. Well listen to this, they are known to freeze their upper bodies when they are lying. We think liars don't look us in the eye. Well listen to this, they look you in the eye more sec just to make up for that myth. We always think of the warmth and the smile sow sincerity and loyalty But a trained lie detector it can detect a mile-long smile. Can you all identify the pretentious smile? You can consciously control them muscles on your cheek. But the real smile is in the eyes, it stays in the eyes. They cannot be controlled consciously, especially if you overuse Botox. Don't overuse Botox, no one will think you're honest. Now we will look at some spots. Can you tell what is going on in the conversation? Can you start seeing the lies discrepancies between people's actions and words? Now I know it's really noticeable but when you are having a conversation to someone you suspect is cheating on you, Behavior, to date, is the greatest indicator of truth. An honest person will be a collaborator. They will tell you they are on your side. They will be enthusiastic. They will express readiness and help to get to the truth. They will be ready for ideas, suspicious names, and provide details. They\\'ll say, \"Hey, maybe it was those payroll guys who forgot to mention. \" They will get angry if they feel they are being unfairly accused throughout the interview, not just in separate sheets; they will be frustrated throughout the interview. If you ask honestly what should we do with those check guys, an honest person has a lot of opportunities recommend a strict sentence rather than a mild one Let's say you have the same conversation with a rogue. This person can withdraw, look down, lower your voice to rest, to behave like a herky-jerky. Ask a rogue to tell their story, they will fill it with full details in some unnecessary places. And then they will re-tell the story in chronological order. And what a trained investigator does is that they get into some sketches and subtle ways for a few hours, and will ask that person to tell the story once again and they will look at the jolts, the stuttering, and will ask him some questions that conclude this is a hoax. Why do they do this? Well we all do the same thing. We practice our words, but rarely do we exercise gestures. We say \"Yes\", we shake hands, \"No\" We tell very compelling stories, and we move our arms. We plead guilty to serious crimes, and we smiled as we walked away from them. And that smile is called \"beast fun\". And we'll see that in some video sequences, but we'll start - for those of you who don't know it, this is the candidate for president, John Edwards who shocked America when she accepted a child out of wedlock. We will see him talking about the paternity test. Watch it now if you can see it he says \"Yes\" while shaking his head for \"No\" shaking a little even the arms. (Video) John Edwards: I would be happy to participate. I know it's impossible for this kid to be mine because of the timing of the events that happened So, I know it's impossible. I'm happy to do the paternity test, and see it happening. Interviewer: Will you do it soon? And it's someone - JE: Well, I'm the only person, the only person who is part of this test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: All right, these head movements are easier to catch if you look at them only once. There will be some when someone makes an expression hiding the other flowing fast like a flash Killers are known to cause distress. Your new partner may shake your hand to celebrate, to go to lunch with you and then display a sense of anger. None of us will become an overnight face recognition expert but I can teach you something that is really dangerous, and easy to learn and that is the expression of contempt. In anger, you got two people in the same field. Still this is a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to despair, you are overbearing. It is related to moral superiority. And for that reason, healing is very, very difficult. Here's how it looks. It is marked by a corner drawn in and out. It is the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt, even if the fraud goes down - and it doesn't happen often - look the other way, go the other direction reconsider the agreement, say \"No thanks. I will not come for just a little weave. Thank you\" Science has revealed many, many indicators. We know, for example that liars often change the norm of ignorance and the legs lead them to the exit. They will receive obstructive objects inserting them between yourself and the person they are interviewing They will change their tone too often reducing the volume. This is the agreement. These behaviors are only behaviors. They are not evidence of fraud. They are just red flags. We are human beings We often make deceptive gestures in many places all day. And these gestures do not have much significance. But when you see them being grouped, then that is the sign. See, hear, investigate, ask some difficult questions, get out of that comfortable position of acquaintance, but go down that path of curiosity, still ask questions, be more dignified, and treat the person you are talking to with a report. Don\\'t try to be like them in \"Law & Rule\" or like in other programs punching their subjective thoughts. Don't be too aggressive because it doesn't work. And we talked a little how to communicate makes us lie and how to discover a liar. And as I promised, we will now see what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers - one is lying, one is telling the truth. And both have surfaced by studio David Matsumoto from California. And I think they are a brilliant example how the truth is revealed in reality. This article, Diane Downs shot her children from close dissonance, sent them to the hospital while they were bleeding all the way, saying that a stranger had done this to her children. And you will see it in the video too that she can't even pretend to be a doting mother. What do you want to see here is an incredible mismatch amidst the horrific events she describes and her very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see a double pleasure in this video (Video) Diane Downs: At night when I closed my eyes, I saw Christ extending his hand while I was giving the car, and blood was starting to flow from his mouth. And that - it will probably disappear with time - but I don't believe it. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'll show you a video of a currently worried mother, Erin Runnion, facing her daughter's killers in court. Here you will not see pretentious emotions, but only a normal expression of a mother in agony. (Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement in the third anniversary of the night you took my baby, and you hurt him, you broke it, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she has fought, I know she has fought against you. But I know she's watching you with her gorgeous brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill him. And I don't understand and I want to never understand. PM: OK, there is no point in doubting the truth of these emotions. Now technology is about the truth of what it looks like is advancing, as is science. We know, for example that we also have specialized eye detectors or infrared scanners, MRIs that can decode the signals our body outputs when we want to cheat. And these technologies will serve each of us as a solution to fraud, and one day they will come up with very interesting results. But also at the same time you have to ask yourself: You will want your side during the meeting someone who has been trained to find the truth or any person who will draw a 400-pound electroencephalogram along the door? The lie detectors rely on human tools. They know, as someone said, \"The character that you are in the dark.\" And what's very interesting is that nowadays we have very little darkness. Our world is illuminated 24 hours a day. It's transparent with blogs and social networks transmitting the movements of the new generation of people who have made the choice to live their lives in public. It's a noisy world. And, a challenge we have is to remember distribution, which is not honesty. Our craze for twittering or writing can blind us to the fact that the details of human behavior, integrity and character they are very important, and that is what will always matter. So in such a noisy world, surely it will make sense to us to be a little more clear about our moral code. When you combine the science of detecting fraud with the art of seeing, listening, you distance yourself from cooperating with a liar. You start this path being a little clearer, because it annoys all the people around you, and say, \"Hey, my world, our world, it has to be honest. My world will be one where it will have a lot of power where the lie is recognized and marginalized. \" And when you do that, the terrain around you will shift slightly. And that's the truth. Thank you ) Applause)", "jzdOvOukfQg": "hello my name is John Rose and this is my 63rd birthday June 17 2017 I am 63 years old today and now I can finally do this video entitle it 63 year old man reveals secrets on how to have a flat belly now I find that fascinating to me because I went to weight loss seminars about 30 years ago and they told us flat-out that men and women were different men usually gain their weight around their abdominal area two particular internal organs women usually around their hips and buttocks for Reproductive purposes but then there were different shapes of people based on races there were apple shape people and pear shape people and then they said something a long time ago that I didn't understand at the time but I sure do understand it now they said but for some reason which we don't know all whole people seem to get weight around their belly y know what that's all about my friends if you ever watched any one of my videos you know what that's all about and if you haven't well this is your lucky day because I can teach you the secrets to have a flat belly at no matter what age it all has to do is the bowel transit time of our food you see my friends were put in food that takes too long to go from point A to point B one of the main reasons why people are sick in this area is because they're processing maybe 12 to 15 mils that are backed up so the average person in America has about 12 or 15 mils are backed up here so you could be doing crunches all day long and never ever ever see the results you're looking for and I see people all the time that are killing themselves going out running ten fifty miles every day to try to lose that little round bowling ball and get that nice lean look that's cut and ripped and they can't get it and the reason is because it isn't fat I'm telling my friends the secret that not having a thick belly is understanding what's inside of our food too when you eat food that has a very small bowel transit time you've got a lot of garbage being processed and you're thick in this area now of course sad is a is a factor obviously even if your pipes are clean if you have too much fat on your body and we have fat underneath our skin that's subcutaneous fat then you can still be working real hard at that six-pack and not be able to see any definition because you got that layer of fat around it however one thing I do understand and that is that it's almost impossible to have too much fat and not have junk inside your pipes they kind of go hand-in-hand it's we're going to be too much food to put excess fat on your body then the chances are your food tube is not gonna be able to handle that much food unless it's the right food and it's almost impossible to eat too much of the right food so if you want a flat stomach where do you begin well first of all if you got a little bowling ball down here you got to get rid of that that's where a solid food vacation comes into play drink nothing but fresh juices for however long it takes and you'll be surprised at how much weight you lose in this area now normally traditionally speaking there is no such thing as spot reduction because that's what we're told when I was going to these Fitness classes as an instructor in other words if you want to lose around your belly you can't do crunches and expect that to do anything if you have extra fat on your outer thigh you can't do outer thigh exercises and expect that to spot reduced fat anymore then inner thigh exercises will reduce the fat on the inner thigh inner side of your thigh but in this area we can do spot reduction if you understand the bowel transit time of your food and change it you can do that two ways you're going to drop the raw vegan diet that drastically changes the bowel transit time your food but if you really want to take it to the next level you take a solid food vacation and you clean everything out and then once you clean everything out that's when you go to a raw vegan diet why because everything you eat is out of you the next day if you're going to beating this other food it's going to be backing up now there's a lot to be said for eatin one mil a day or intermittent intermediate fasting where you only eat within a very small window maybe four to six hours or so in fact I I'm always intrigued when I see anyone a little bit older and that has a flat belly and I can tell they're probably not eating that well especially I see them in the grocery store I could tell what they have in a basket and all that good and I kind of have an idea what's going on but always asking what you're secretin and most of the time they tell me only one mil a day so that's one way to have a fat stomach you know why is that because every time you put food in your stomach it takes away energy down below that's why snacking all day long is not a good idea but isn't that what the experts say exactly our experts are misdirected they don't know anything they don't even study the bowel transit time of our food otherwise they would know that snacking throughout the day is not a good option so our experts on our experts you've got to be the expert and you can do that by taking a solid food vacation because we're making five main mistakes some of y'all aren't going to accept that those are all mistakes but if you correct all of them and you see your life go to another level then you might think twice about putting them through it especially if it has the wrong bowel transit time now as I mentioned there is no such thing as spot reduction but we can focus on this area in fact there's an area right in here right below or right in between my rib cage right in here where I'm pushing this is called the transverse abdominal muscles now this is one muscle that will help you have a flat stomach and when it comes to abdominal exercises I don't do anything specifically really like abdominal crunches I had anything like that in 30 years but I do focus right here in this part of my belt my body I focus on sucking this in tighten them isometrically and that's the key about these muscles wedged in between our pelvic girdle they don't have a range of motion there's only one way to exercise them so most people they're lazy the bill it bulges out and the back sways so how do you prevent that how do you correct it how do you have good posture well you tighten those transverse ABS and when you tighten those transverse ABS it straightens out your back so if you have back problems this many times maybe the only thing you have to do but if you want to have a nice flat step stomach you want those muscles to be trained all day long and what you're going to find is that they're very weak in the beginning and and how do you use them we'll think about this if you see someone you want to press what you do you suck in the stomach well when you do that that's what you're working on you're working on those transverse ABS so you should be sucking in your stomach all day long and you should be conscious of that to a point where it's part of your movement is part of your posture it helps protect your back and make sure it's in alignment get out of here and especially when you exercise and do anything sports oriented this is where your Chi energies derived from your transverse abdominal areas so I trained these muscles a long time ago and I'm very conscious of them whenever I'm biking or walking or anything I make sure they're nice and firm and they're solid and the pulling things back I remember I had I used to have an old football injury that plagued me for a long time until I learned about these transverse ABS and the pain went away within about a week after me working those muscles over and over and over now in other ways that they could use these muscles if you got on all fours like a dog or a cat and then you rounded your back like a cat that's using those transverse abdominal muscles and again you should use them all the time you can do it while you're driving what I did is I tried to use them 24/7 or every moment I was awake I was gonna say I'm tighten them I'm tightening I'm tightening you like to feel it helping my back whole back injury and I kept forgetting I kept forgetting but I tried I try not probably about 50 percent successful but every since then I now have a very conscious awareness of where those are at and when I'm walking and everything whatever I do I'm always tightening those train Ezra's AB so when you do abdominal crunches what's the first thing they tell you to do belly to the floor press your back and smaller back to the floor how do you do that you're pressured transverse AB now if you do want to go for the six-pack personally I don't I'm not going to do that that's why I don't have these big bulging muscles you might see a little remnants of them in there from long ago but I don't train them now when I bike I'm twisted and twerking a bunch and I'm always doing things to work my abs in that area as far as going up and down crunches I don't do that but if you're going to do them I'm going to teach you a secret I learned back when I was doing a 30-minute abdominal class at the Houstonian 30 minutes non-stop ab work and when I get one thing I saw results within a week that I wasn't seeing before and yet I was doing it for 30 minutes and what it's called is hesitating abdominal crunches now normally when you're doing abdominal crunches especially to music that has a you know added a consonant and in the music so you do it every two counts up and down up and down up and down and you pick music that's at a pretty slow pace like 120 beats per minute or some like that but what you do with the hesitating abdominal crunches I'm going to illustrate this vertically I think I can do it normally what you're doing you put your hands on the back and you're going up sitting down and lift and down but what you do is hesitating abdominal crunches is you go up and then you hold it and then you go up and you hold it then you go up and then you hold it then you go back down so it's up up up down you do it that's how you do the eight feet you go up and hold it up and hold it up and hold it and then you go back down and why do you do that because the body knows how to cheat when it gets the T the whole idea if you want to tone your muscles or body you use the overload principle you make the muscle tied you make it keep working but when the body gets tired knows how to cheat and what it will do is it will do two one or two things usually one is it will start using momentum they'll start swinging so you've got to take the momentum away and that's what the hesitating crunches - otherwise you're kind of getting it you know you're rolling into it and that's not the way to do it also not a mistake I always see people doing they do a full set up once you get past a certain range of motion it's all hip flexors you're not working your abs and you more so if you want to focus on the ABS do the hesitating crunches and then the other way the body will cheat if you let it it'll change the angle of motion or the angle just slightly so if you're working your inner thighs and say this my inner thigh and I'm going like this when I get really tired I'll slightly change that angle a little bell be using different muscles so good form is important if you're trying to tone the body but most importantly take away the momentum make it work control the movement and remember the best way to have a flat stomach is the food with the right bowel transit time because when you can do that my friends you're going to basically become disease proof just because to become the disease group you have to be fireproof you can't be cooking your food now some cooked food will go through the system fast enough maybe some vegetable soup or something like that so can you start getting the beans and legumes and stuff like that you're going to see that you're gonna start getting sick in this area again go back to unique you're gonna start noticing you're getting sick in this area again so if you're anything like me it's going to be a learning experience you're going to eat as good as you can you'll do a solid food vacation you get cleaned out your eyes oh my god that's what I'm supposed to look like and then you'll eat good and we bad you get that stuff back in there let's go back on the plans again so hopefully you can learn from my experiences it took me took me two years on six seven occasions before I realized number one I wasn't going to distance and then when I finally went the distance why I finally realized how much of a cesspool I had inside of me a 20-pound cesspool once I finally realized that then I was motivated to not put anything in that has the wrong Beltran's of time and so that's what life is all about my friends if you want to be happy and you want a fat stomach they go hand-in-hand if you do it the right way so there are the healthy ways to have a fat stomach you want to do it the healthy way by eating nutrient dense foods and that's I tell you my friends we want to make life exciting eat the right foods have a fat stomach and then you're in for a treat", "k6hTa5ti35E": "[Music] the wisest person I ever met in my life a third-grade dropouts why is this and drop out in the same sentence as rather

this man ever men in my life just a simple cook left school in the third grade to help out on the family farm but just because he left school doesn't mean a Jessica education stop Mark Twain once said I've never allowed my schooling to get in the way in my education my father taught himself how to read taught himself how to write decided in the midst of Jim Crow ISM as America was breeding the last gasp of the Civil War my father decided he was going to stand and be a man not a black man not a brown man not a white man but a man he literally challenged himself to be the best that he could all the days of his life I have four degrees my brother is a judge we're not the smartest ones in our family it's a third grade dropout Danny a third grade dropout daddy who was quoting Michelangelo saying those boys I won't have a problem if you aim high and miss but I'm gonna have a real issue if you aim low and hit a country mother quoting Henry Ford saying if you think you can or if you think you can't you're right I learned that from a third grade drop simple lessons lessons like these son you'd rather be an hour early than a minute late we never knew what time it was in my house cuz the clocks were always ahead my mother said for nearly 30 years my father left the house at 3:45 in the morning one day she asked him why daddy he said maybe one of my boys will catch me in the act of excellence I want to share two things with you Aristotle said you are what you repeatedly do therefore excellent taught me I have it not an act don't ever forget that I know you're tough but always

want to send that to let me say it again ego is the anesthesia that Denton's the pain of stupidity pride is the burden of a foolish person John Wooden coached basketball in UCLA for a living but his calling was the impact people and with all those national championships guess what he was found doing in the middle of the week going into the cupboard grabbing a broom and sweeping his own gym floor you want to make an impact find your borough every day of your life you find your broom you grow your influence step way that way you're attracting people so that you can impact them final lesson son  you're gonna do a job doing right I've always been told how average I can be always been criticized about being average but I want to tell you something I stand here before you before all of these people not listening to those words but telling myself every single day to shoot for the stars to be the best that I can be good enough isn't good enough if it can be better and better isn't good enough if it can be best let me close with a very personal story that I think will bring all this into focus wisdom will come to you in the unlikeliest of sources a lot of times through failure when you hit rock-bottom remember this while you're struggling rock-bottom can also be a great foundation on which to build and on which to grow I'm not worried that you'll be successful I'm worried that you won't fail from time to time person that gets up off the canvas and keeps growing that's the person that will continue to grow their influence back in the 70s to help me make this point let me introduce you to someone I'm at the finest woman I've ever met in my life mm-hmm back in my day we'd have called her a brick house  this woman was the finest woman I'd ever seen in my life there's just one little problem back then ladies didn't like big old linemen The Blind Side hadn't come out yet they liked quarterbacks and running backs breathless dance and I find out her name is Trina Williams from Lompoc California and we were all dancing and we're just just excited and I decide in the middle of dancing with her that I would ask her for a phone number she Katrina was the first one Trina was the only woman in college who gave me her real telephone number the next day we walked to Baskin and Robbins ice cream parlor my friends couldn't believe it this has been 40 years ago and my friend still can't believe it we go on a second date and a third date and a fourth date mm-hmm we drive from Chico to Vallejo so that she could meet my parents my father meets her my daddy my hero he meets her pulls me to the side and says is she psycho but anyway we go together for a year two years three years four years by now Trina's a senior in college I'm still a freshman but I'm working some things out I'm so glad I graduated in four terms Nixon Ford Carter Reagan so now it's time to propose so I talked to her girlfriends and it's California it's in the 70s so it has to be outside have to have a candle and have to have you know some chocolate listen I'm from the hood had a bottle of Boone's Farm wine that's what I had she said yes that was the key I married the most beautiful woman I've ever seen him I y'all ever been to a wedding and even before the wedding starts you hear this how in the world  and it was coming from my side of the family  we get married we have a few children our lives are great one day Trina finds a lump in her left breasts breast cancer six years after that diagnosis me and my two little boys walked up to mommy's casket and for two years my heart didn't beat it wasn't for my faith in God I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for those two little boys there'd have been no reason for which to go on I was completely lost dad was rock bottom you know what sustained me the wisdom of a third grade dropout the wisdom of a simple cook we're at the casket I'd never seen my dad cry but this time I saw my dad cry that was his daughter Trina was his daughter not his daughter-in-law and I'm right behind my father about to see her for the last time on this earth and my father shared three words with me two changed my life right there at the casket it would be the last lesson he would ever teach me he said son just stand you keep standing you keep sitting no matter how rough the sea you keep standing and I'm not talking about just water you keep standing no matter what you don't give up and as clearly as I'm talking to you today these were some of her last words to me she looked me in the eye and she said it doesn't matter to me any longer how long I live what matters to me most is how I live - all one question a question that I was asked all my life by a third grade dropout how you live in how you live in every day asked yourself that question how you live in here's here's what a cook would suggest you to live this way that you would not judge that you would show up early that you'd be kind that you make sure that that servants town is huge and used that if you're gonna do something you do it the right way that that cook would tell you this that it's never wrong to do the right thing that how you do anything is how you do everything and in that way you will grow your influence to make an impact in that way you will honor all those who have gone before you who have invested in you look in those unlikeliest places for is enhance your life every day by seeking that wisdom and asking yourself every night how am i living [Music]  my grandmother became my first hero growing up my grandmother never used an alarm clock but every morning my grandmother would wake up at 4:15 and at 4:16 her feet would hit the floor usually right in front of my face and that's what would wake me up but I would lay there and I would pretend like I was still asleep because me and 4:15 really didn't get along but grandma would look at the back of my head I could feel her staring at me and then finally she would say now sugar grandmama know you ain't sleep you just want to go on and get on up and get ready for school my grandmother was known for saying things that would kind of make you a little angry because they made so much sense you can argue other parents you know there's things that you when you become parents you start to say to your own kids my grandmother would say now son you knew when you lay down there last night that you had to get up this morning I don't know why every single morning you lay there in that surprise he asked to be faithful that the lowest saw fit to wake you up this in your right my but what my grandmother was encouraging me to do was simply to be grateful for the opportunity in spite of all that I had been through in my life she just wanted to make sure that I understood the opportunity that I've been given my life got started it was a little rough a little rough start I was born too much premature my mother was walking up a flight of stairs and she had noticed at the time but a woman she had had an argument with earlier was standing above her holding a pot of boiling water as my mom made her way up those stairs that woman dumped that water onto my mom and since her tumbling down the stairs need to premature labor she was here 30 degree burns over 25 percent of her body and when we were finally allowed to leave the hospital as you can imagine my mom was in a great deal of pain those burners just nearly barely missed her face and covered most of the front of her body so when we got home she began taking a heavy sedative pain medication to help her recover when she took that medication it was very difficult for her to watch me so I would bounce around a lot I'd stay with my mom for a little bit and I'd go stay with Grandma now I stay with some neighbors of aunties and then back to my mother's house I did that for the first three years of my life I was three years old I was back to a mom's house and I got it to her person I found that medication I swallowed everything in the bottle when they found me they rushed me to the hospital and my heart would stop and eventually I wanted to a coma but because of that accident because of that incident the state of California they did an investigation and the conclusion that they came to us that it wasn't an accident they removed me from my mother's home made a ward of the ward of the state and eventually I went into a foster care system shortly after I arrived to one of my foster homes my foster mom her name's miss Alexander miss Alexander began lock him inside the closet you know like she'd opened the closet door she kicked me hitting me with a stick or a strap or whatever see whatever she had it was while I was in that foster home that I was sexually abused for the first time oftentimes people will ask you know if that has to be a worst thing that could happen to something I've scars on my body that you can't see have a burn here in my hand that she would deal with an iron but all that pain went away worse teen that mrs. Alexander would do is to open the closet door she was standing over me she would say it you stupid and you never amount to nothing that hurt me more than any other physical kicks on the physical team because I believed it for a long time I believed that that I would never amount to anything just like she said I didn't notice at the time I found out a little bit later but my grandmother my healer she had started going back and forth to court trying to prove that she could take care of an active handsome little Ward and eventually the state of California they granted her full custody of me and I'll never forget I was I will never forget standing on this Alexander's front porch waiting she had my little belongings everything that I had I remember standing there you may have only been a half an hour but it felt like an eternity and I can remember thinking maybe no one's coming after a while at the end of the block I see the ugliest car I've ever seen in my life and the car pulls up right in front of the porch and I remember all I can see these two big glasses bifocals and I found out later that grandma had glaucoma she wasn't supposed to be driving but she gets out of that big car and she's got on this white floppy hat with this it was a flower right there in the middle and I remember she had on this long white dress that came all the way down to her ankles and I found out later that you know that was Grandma Sunday best it was not fit that she only reserved for special occasions I can remember for once in my life feeling like I was some special occasion I remember jumping into grandma's arms and squeezing her and I remember her whispering and saying to me everything's ok your family and everything was ok just like grandmother said and I had a lot to look forward to I found out that my mom was going to court trying to prove that she could take care of me and I could remember sitting there with my mother and we we talked and we had a lot of different conversations one thing I can remember saying mama you know one day when I get big I'm about your nice house with a fireplace said mama one day I'm a-gonna body with nice car not like Grandmama's and get you a nice home but the truth is I just really wanted to become a family again and that's what I looked forward to when I was 12 years old I was asleep on my grandmother's floor it was about 4 o'clock in the morning we get a knock on the door and it was my mom's roommate miss how I miss how I come quick miss how was my grandma she said come quick it's Ruth Ruth was my mom so I can't wake her up I think she's dead I can remember laying on that floor you know kind of wishing it was thinking hoping but it was maybe a dream but it wasn't and that's how I found out that all the hopes and dreams and things that I had to look forward to weren't gonna happen I became very angry I became confused I was hurt I didn't really understand what was happy I started acting out hanging out with wrong people breaking in houses started stealing cars I remembered not really caring what happened to me continue that behavior until I was 19 I was 19 I was very myself standing in front of the judge I was handcuffed had a chain around my waist and wear handcuffs were attached to that chain the judge looked at me since the state of California sentences you 15 years in prison for armed robbery and assault gentlemen that day when that door closed behind me for the first time as a convicted felon I remember standing in that empty cell remember I need started to get weak and they start to shake uncontrollably and I collapsed I fell to the floor I just started crying alone I remember hearing voices heard the voice of my foster mom saying you stupid me whenever Mountain nothing heard the voice of family members and friends of family I said that boys end up just like his father my father was a career criminal I can remember laying there thinking to myself that this is where I'm gonna die but here's what happened that would change my life shortly after I arrived to that prison there was an educator there his name was Charles Lyell's 6 to 3 ex-marine and I don't know what it was about me but every time he saw me he said hey mr. Humphrey he has his big smile on his face I smile that my kids would say that's creepy but he's smiling he said hey mr. Humphrey how are you doing he always called me mr. Humphrey you gave me that respect he walked into my cell he looked at me he said mr. Humphrey says prison doesn't have to be your life he says you can get out of here and you can do great things she started to walk away him before he walked out of my cell he turned around one last time he says mr. Humphrey I said yes sir he says I believe in you he walked out of my cell  and if he I continue to stand there he would have seen the tears running down my face because no one had ever said that to me but I remember just thinking to myself I'm gonna make some changes and I'm gonna change my life and a little over four years after the day I could originally collapsed and fell to the floor I walked out of that prison that was over 18 years ago I've never been back other than the mentor and help other people but here's what I know I know that when you've had a rough life when you feel unwanted I know that when you have hopes and dreams and when you have things that you can look forward to and when you have people in place that support you and push you I know that that gives you a reason to live it is a great day to be alive and that's something that I haven't always said but now it's something that I say to myself every single day at some point if I'm having a great day or a bad day that's something that I say but what I also understand is that what my grandmother was taking her higher power for each and every day was for the opportunity that she'd been given and she never missed an opportunity to tell anyone that would listen especially me it's a great day  [Music] well I'm not supposed to be here I'm actually not supposed to be alive I thought I was going to die I felt like I was in prison I was scared I was born in Abbotsford British Columbia Canada on December 21st 1969 my parents Elio and William Ranallo were immigrants from Italy who of course like so many millions of others came to North America looking for a better life and they put down roots on our six acre farm at a very young age I knew that there was something a little different with me in terms of the way I reacted to people and and sounds and I became infatuated with television and radio my father and I always had issues in terms of who I was and who he wanted me to be my dad being your stereotype of the old-school immigrant dad working hard getting their hands dirty life is tough nothing is easy nothing's gonna be given to you I was the antithesis of that and it caused a lot of problems between my father and I growing up I was an artist I was very high ultra-sensitive I didn't like doing manual chores and because of that I became even more ultra shy where I would lock myself in my room or being almost a mute at home so in school I was put in lockers the kid that was bullied the kid that was picked on the kid who was made to feel stupid even though he got great marks it was not a good time it was a very depressing time and thankfully one friend that I was able to make was Michael John Janssen we lived not too far away from each other and quickly discovered that we both shared a love of professional wrestling you know other kids would make fun of it or whatever even though most of them were probably watching I thought wow this guy gets it we were over at each other's house every weekend doing their own wrestling matches and it got to the point we were putting on wrestling matches in the hallway at lunch where you would think the school the would say okay enough of that no more they ended up watching us there would be like a hundred kids making circles because we like we'd have maths I put together storylines like we create this Improv Theater in the hallway and and people loved it and we're like wow we're popular now and so he and I just just had this incredible bond we both enjoyed the same thing we we both suffered through the the same thing you know in terms of socially maybe being a little awkward otherwise with the girls or whatnot so he became another member of my family and when I was 16 my best friend and I'm Michael John Janssen went to the high school charity show after practice the promoter al Tomko was doing the ring announcing he asked if any of one of us had handled a microphone before and Mike starts laughing saying well Mauro's the biggest month in the school he's in announcer he loves this stuff I end up announcing the rest of the show at the end of the show the promoter comes out of the back smiling and he goes what's her name kid and I said I'm more over now though you like I think I have some work for you are you able to come to the BC TV television studios the following Tuesday yes for sure okay great see you then I didn't quite understand what it just happened but I had gone from being the shy quirky class clown with dreams of being on television one day and working for all-star wrestling - all of a sudden having the promoter of all-star wrestling al Tomko invite me to be CTV television studios the following week my friend Michael Jansen lost his mind screaming running down the hallway Mauro's gonna be on TV morals gonna be on TV I was just enthralled with what was happening and I'm I mean I get goosebumps now I was over the moon and I thought this is it I'm I'm gonna become a superstar my lifelong dream is going to become a reality [Music]  on July 7th 1989 his sister Debbie phoned me so it was about 6:00 in the morning I answered the phone half awake and I thought that his sister Debbie was laughing but she was in you know just devastated crying hysterically saying that something had happened that Michael was gone I hang up the phone not really being able to absorb what I just heard I didn't believe it I guess I I didn't understand I thought she was making a joke or I I was totally disconnected wasn't until I saw my mom that I completely lost it and it realized that my best friend had died at the age of 19 due to a heart attack that set off a spiral downward that resulted in me being hospitalized by my girlfriend at the time there was a hurricane in my mind I felt like I was in prison I was scared I thought I was going to die and I was diagnosed with manic depressive disorder they say that mental health issues is triggered by traumatic events and it doesn't get more traumatic - losing your best friend at the age of 19 and it's not easy it's not easy [Music] I got really angry at the doctors and everyone else who had the audacity of the temerity to tell me that there was something wrong with me I'm living the dream I'm doing more work than anybody I'm making more money than anyone I know I'm I'm helping people I'm a good person what do you mean there's something wrong with me in my brain and my 20s were a complete and utter disaster but I was hospitalized multiple times for the longest being three months and the toll that it took on my family my employment my personal relationships it is truly I believe a miracle that I survived my 20s and my refusal to acknowledge that I was mentally ill so I did what was necessary I myself to treatment when I finally admitted that yes my name is Mauro Ranallo I suffer from bipolar affective disorder I need help then and only then that I finally get to see sustained success in all realms of my life it almost is because of my dad and the relationship and the struggles that we had that proved to be the fuel that I needed I I continue to fight and proving to my dad that hey your son a is not only going to be okay but be I went on and you know became the first broadcaster in network television history to call MMA boxing pro wrestling and kick boxing on network TV I've called the two biggest combat sports pay-per-views in history that is why I want to share all of my story with people is because you must never truly give up and that's why pressure the cliche says will either burst pipes or create diamonds well I've first a lot of pipes and I'm still that proverbial diamond in the rough I think we're all in a fight every day is a fight it's not always a negative thing a fight a fight sometimes you're fighting for your voice to be heard you're fighting for civil rights all of us have a gift every single human has a gift and a purpose in life and for the large majority fear is precluding them from pursuing their true path people need people to tell them you know what it's going to be tough but you can do it people need to stop hearing no you're not good enough no you're not pretty enough no you're not smart enough  [Music] my wife came into my life inside to ask me why is it that you don't talk to your family that often and I'd told her story like I didn't I don't think they love me I don't think they want me I think they don't appreciate me I don't think they care honestly so my brothers l didn't mean about three years and so the grandparents smother him with love and then my parents brother Hamlet loves he's getting love from everywhere what would happen is often I would be wearing the same clothes that he wore to school because it was always first used by him I get everything secondhand say there was a matters on the floor and that was for two people that was me and my brother now how brothers are me and my brother start fighting for space because my brother was bigger than me say it would push me to a corner but like though no I need more space I'm bigger elder than you and as we were arguing and fighting my mom stormed out of a room and goes I did go to sleep and I'm like but I can't go to sleep I don't have enough space and brothers fighting me for the space and I can't really sleep in this little space and my mom goes no I just go to sleep I take my pillow and borrow my head into it and I start sobbing in India when somebody is a loved child they called him Mira la which simply means you had loved one all the time I used to say he's your la I am you her which means he's the one that you'd really love and I'm the one that you're indifferent towards or you don't care what I was really trying to say is I don't feel the love and why I'm why am i hated so much our life started to change a little bit because now I was growing older I was in getting into my teens and my brother left the city and as he was moving away the expectations start to rely a lot more on me and so it was constantly told hey go become an engineer you need to go become an engineer you need to study hard so you can become an engineer and as I was studying for these exam as I was preparing for these exams I realized that if what I'm studying right now is what I have to do for the next four years or for the rest of my life I'm going to be miserable and that kind of gave me a dimensional saying hey why am I doing this I am doing this because my mom says so then I've taken many chances in life after that and every time I would take a chance if it seemed like the stupid thing to do but I will constantly take them because I just knew that what I really wanted to was I need to be successful I need to get out of this house and I was able to do that by the time I was twenty eight twenty nine [Music]  seven years later what I'm realizing on the inside is that my health was deteriorating I couldn't sleep without a drink I had grown even more distant to my parents it was almost like a you know it's like a task that you check off oh I should call mom at least once a week said would be one of those things where I'm actually doing something else while she's on speaker right there was no connection my wife came into my life inside to ask me why is it that you don't talk to your family that often and I had told her story like I didn't I don't think they love me I don't think they want me I think they don't appreciate me I don't think they care honestly she kind of said why don't we do this we were going to India just to travel but you like why don't we go together and why don't you bring your parents on and bring your body brother and your sister-in-law and their kids to come together and we'll go to like a retreat center and just hang out for a couple of days by just four or five days just hang out and I was like I've never done that we haven't hung out since ever probably and so I we bring the family together we find this retreat center close to the city that I'm from Jaipur and and we all go there and one of the evenings in this is I think the the second-to-the-last evening where my my my wife and then girlfriend suggested hey I did we are here like this is the time you can actually have a conversation about this that you've been talking about I mean sitting all all across the table the same table and and I start sharing I start more than me sharing it was more a question for the table it was like okay what is it that you feel about each other let's share some honest truths about each other and what we're proud of what our concerns are so forth and and my turn comes and I say I've never felt loved by my mom and dad and they were right there and I've never felt that the bonding and the connection and and they listen very quietly and they listen very quietly they listen and hear me all out and then my dad asked me a question and the question was I did you have two hands right like yes like your right hand on the left hand which one do you love more and it's like both of him I mean it's not one hand that I love more and so he said that's like having kids you don't love one of your hands one more and you don't love one of your kids more but when one of your hand is in some pain you just pay attention to it you have to because it's in pain right now right but as soon as there it's healed you don't pay attention to it anymore you you treat them equally you love them equally in the moment it was just a metaphor but it became my truth eventually that it's not that somebody loves you or somebody doesn't love you especially parents it's not that you love somebody I don't love somebody in context for example it's me getting a oversized shirt wasn't about they love my they loved my brother it was about them not being able to afford new shirts all the time me getting the second-hand bicycle wasn't about me not one them not wanting to give me a new bicycle but it was about them being able to only afford one bicycle at a time that was a big release for me because I had held on to that for all of my life and I was driven from place of I'll show you only recently when we actually had a child I realized that as much as much power the word love has it doesn't do justice to what you feel and you have a child what I have for my son I can't explain I can't explain because transcends love it's important that we know how loved we are the fact that we take up space means something that we are worthy of love giving and receiving and that no matter who we are the way we show up in the world is deserving of love and if ever you feel unloved remember that all you need to do is change your perspective for love is always there  I was in a crib and two adults were yelling but my mom came in the crib and was like it's okay and my mom I could remember my mom crying so my very earliest memory as a human is instability my dad was like a big he was a pro bodybuilder he's a big strong guy and I would tell people about my dad like he was still in my life I never told them cuz they'd be like well where's your dad and I'd be like oh he's busy he can't come but the truth was he was they didn't cared that much my mom says hi when I was pregnant with you the FBI kicked down the door with guns put guns in my face took your dad away and brought him across the country to Terminal Island off Long Beach I remember was my birthday my dad when he got out of prison he he just stayed in Long Beach but for that birthday my dad's like I will drive down and take you out to dinner and he said he'd be there at like 5:00 p.m. and she had to go to work she had a night shift job and she's like okay your dad will be here soon so I'm gonna leave you out the house alone so I sat there I was kind of on the couch and I remember waiting for my dad and it was like 5:30 came 6-nothing we had a home landline like waiting for the phone to ring 7/8 I remember being like super sad going but you're a little kid so you're like I have hopefully he's still gonna come in just late he's just lately just late I don't remember how long it was but my mom said she came home at midnight I was just asleep like literally like on the couch just like looking out the window and he never came and so I remember that being like super painful and being just like my dad doesn't care about me life will throw tremendous blows at you you'll have the betrayal of a close friend or family member you'll have you know sickness death life is painful if I perceive it as what it was supposed to be but the second I switch in and go wait no life's like a puzzle that I was handed here's your puzzle light of life tie we took a piece out the dad was gone and when I look at life like that my life's like an adventure and I'm thankful for even the stuff that sucked in the most painful day and sometimes in the moment I couldn't see it there but in hindsight I'm like but I wouldn't have found that puzzle piece nobody in my family had ever really made money and you know they say poverty is systemic and it's true like most people you can't rise out of like your socio-economic class like one of the biggest predictors of where you'll be in life is where you're born it sucks breaking the cycle is something that has to start happening in the world and what broke the cycle for me was like realizing that I was doing it wrong I was in a mobile home in Clayton North Carolina and I did not have a job I didn't have a resume I didn't have anything to put on a resume I didn't have a college degree just laying there on the couch and when I was laying there the question that came in my head was is this it all my friends went to college they had parents that have more money and they had this and like I missed this I remember just going to sleep I was just depressed and the next day my mom was there and she said you should read this book Tony Robbins and I remember being like oh I don't want some self-help book that she's I can't you should read it look so I read it and I don't remember that much of what I read but I remember the one-page and it said all greatness starts with failure because when you succeed you party and when you fail you ponder and all greatness comes from pondering your situation and I remember thinking that's what I was doing last night on the couch I was like pondering like what did I do wrong and and I made myself vulnerable to the fact that maybe I did make mistakes maybe I had to change my life maybe we had to listen to different people maybe I had to try a new path you know Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results and I'm like ty you're being stubborn so after I read that book I was like imma try something new so I went back in that mobile home I found a yellow pages and I remember flipping through it going to the financial section and there was this full-page ad by this guy Mike Stainback it said Stainback financial services and I kind of pretended I didn't lie but I kind of pretended I was coming there to be a customer and I get to the place and I'm like I'm Ty can I speak to your boss and I'll never forget he was sitting like this like um big like lazy boy chair and he had this big mustache he looked like Tom Selleck I wanted to be super honest with him I said listen Mike you don't know who I am but I know you must be successful because you've got a full-page ad in the yellow pages that's all I know about you but I know that costs a lot of money if you teach me what you know about making money I'll work for you for free and he was sitting like in this charity he was I was talking to him this way and he was sideways and he just slowly pivoted his chair you know I've been looking for someone like you for 20 years you come back in the morning and I'll set you up with your own office and you can work for me and I promise you if you listen to what I'm going to say one day you'll hug my neck and he did have an office but what he had done was he cleaned out a closet with no windows and he had put a desk it's where all the filing cabinets was i sat down on the chair and he plopped down pieces of paper and said Cole call these people I'll give you a percentage of the money you make from them no guarantees working for me so I just started calling and I sucked at it I would coffee bought six you know after 6:00 at night they were like all of you they were hanging up on me I remember being like oh no I think I've gone from nightmare to another nightmare but I started to get curious and creative and I wrote down a few little different things I would say to the people and I remember in that first month I started opening up deals for this might stain backer and I opened a deal that was one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in commissions if the deal went through and I remember going Wow life can change like fast and within nine months I went from zero dollars to making a hundred grand I remember being like this is the pinnacle of my life and I went out from then like a madman I became a CFP a certified financial planner I got into finance I learned I read every book you can either be paralyzed by what life gave you and let the pain because there will be pain that will be drama you can either let it build up and like build scar tissue that that just paralyzes you or at some point you go the cars didn't weren't dealt for me like I wanted and so I'm gonna go recreate those cards and that's what mentors well for me and I think for every person you got a different path that you have I just spoke on this subject that I think is like the ultimate puzzle piece you get this down most your problems go away I call it the law of 33% basically you should spend 33% of your day around people who have not accomplished what you've accomplished yet you can help them like you mentor them and there's always those people and you need to spend time around people that you can help and then you spend 33 percent of your time around people who are on your level like you're about at the same level of a cop of what you're trying to do those are your become your close friends you know those are the people you hang out with on the weekend but the last 33 percent is the magical one that doesn't happen in our school system and almost no one even tries to find these people unfortunately you should spend 33 percent of your time around people who are 5 10 20 30 years ahead where you want to be and if you do the math you know that's like a couple hours a day and now you can do it YouTube video so you can do it with a book you can do it with an audio book you can do a face input videos if you can start absorbing from the world's greatest line download their advice into your brain there are 40 years of experience in pain and reward in making mistakes in accomplishing great things and you can you basically get like a cheat sheet and if you can absorb that and this is what I tell myself every day I wake up it's like Thai law 33% we spending time with I think the most pain that we get in life is when we think life is like a straight-line start-finish and here's what's supposed to nothing supposed to happen there today it doesn't work that way sometimes the photo piece to swap out and you can't overreact in life if you want to have a complete life you go find a piece you put the piece back in you have to take your destiny in your own hand and try to recreate what you missed out on for good or bad today I control my own destiny  [Music]", "1EcbsQVWY_4": "how to lose belly fat naturally without exercise whether your goal is just to get a little bit flatter belly for the beach or if you want to lose some of that intra-abdominal belly fat that's associated with metabolic syndrome and a whole range of different degenerative diseases we're going to talk about the mechanisms how it works what won't work so that you understand how to do it right so you can get healthy and reach your goal coming right up I'm doctor Ekberg I'm a holistic doctor and a former Olympic decathlete and if you want to truly master health by understanding how the body really works make sure that you subscribe and hit that notification bell so that you don't miss anything so I wanted to do this video because I saw some other videos that were just so full of nonsense that suggested that or we'll just do these exercises for seven days and you will have a flat belly and they showed all these ridiculous before-and-after pictures so it gets people into the wrong idea of what's required and what works so when I say that you can do it without exercise that doesn't mean that you want to do it without exercise it just means that the exercise that most people suggest is not going to get you a flatter belly and it is not going to get you healthier it's not going to reverse the underlying mechanisms some people are looking for that six-pack look or they just want to tone look and other people are looking to get rid of that Apple shape where they don't have a waist where most of the weight sits in the mid section which is a very unhealthy place because that intra-abdominal fat is the result of insulin resistance and because of that it is driving you toward metabolic syndrome with high blood pressure high cholesterol obesity diabetes etc so that's what we want to avoid now first let's just look a little bit at the anatomy this so some people suggest that all will just do some sit-ups let's that's how you get that sit six-pack first you have your abdominal cavity with your vital organs with your intestines and then you can have the intra-abdominal fat which is the visceral fat it's fat intermingle it's filling out the spaces between the abdominal organs and it's supposed to be there but it's not supposed to grow huge it's not we're not supposed to have a lot of fat there and then you have your subcutaneous fat that's the outer layer and in order for you to have a six-pack that needs to be really really thin so that the muscle can show through and then the muscle itself it's called rectus abdominis that's the flat belly that that's the six-pack look that muscle is only about 3/8 of an inch thick so if it's not showing you're not going to be able to exercise that muscle and make it show it's not about the muscle you're not going to be able to do sit-ups or core strength and have that show through an inch and a half of belly fat so even if you were to double that 3 and 1/8 inches or about 10 millimeters it's not going to make a whole lot of difference I'm sure there's some bodybuilders that have more than the 3/8 of an inch but the key is that exercising the muscle is not gonna make it show through the fat and it's not gonna burn fat specifically there it's not like the the nutrients for that muscle comes from that fat that's just not the way it works energy is processed systemically and you're not going to burn more in one place just because you exercise that area so I just want to dispel some of that and some of those myths so it doesn't mean that exercise is bad I think you should do core strength I just think you should exercise I think you should go for walks because it's good for your brain it's good for circulation it's good for hormones just get out the mindset that you can get a six-pack by doing crunches and exercise if you are a bodybuilder and you already have very very low belly fat and subcutaneous fat then obviously getting a little bit more tone in that muscle can make the 6-pack show a little more but for most people that's not where it's at so for most people it's not about crunches it's about reversing the underlying mechanism of what put that fat there in the first place I want to bring to your attention something about body shape that's gonna make a lot of sense to you there's something called Cushing's disease or Cushing's syndrome also known as hypercortisolism and this is where they have a pathology it's usually a pituitary tumor the pituitary is a hormonal gland and it produces hormones to stimulate a bunch of other glands and one of the glands they stimulate are the adrenals so if you have a tumor then that gland can put out an excessive amount a pathological amount of adrenal stimulating hormone so now the adrenals just go to work and they're cranking out cortisol around the clock and as a result the body type gets a very particular very characteristic shape so these people are gonna have a lot of belly fat the cortisol creates belly fat and they're gonna have a lot of intra-abdominal fat and they're gonna have a lot of subcutaneous fat but it mostly it just starts growing in the midsection they're also going to have thin legs the muscles are gonna be eaten away from their legs so they got thin skinny legs they're gonna have a flat butt they're gonna have stretch marks they're gonna have easy bruising and also in addition to the belly they're going to put fat in one more place and that's at the top of the back of the upper back called the Buffalo Hump all of these are very characteristic marks of Cushing's disease but if you think and if you look around and you think about how many people do I know that kind of sort of looks like this that they may not have a full-blown Cushing's but they look a lot like that and the reason they look a lot like that is that they have a very high level of cortisol they have a very high level of insulin so even though it's not a disease it's not a pathology they have just through lifestyle through stress and sugar they have driven their body like halfway to Cushing's and if you think about it this probably describes a lot of people like maybe half the population over 50 here is what's happening this is why they're gonna get that particular body shape cortisol is a stress hormone whenever you have stress whenever you put an increased demand on your body when your body has to defend itself it's going to produce additional blood sugar if the cortisol is there to increase blood sugar but it's not for the blood sugar itself it's to provide additional fuel for the cell so cortisol puts the sugar into the blood and it's the liver typically that makes that blood sugar it starts making it from glycogen that's stored in the liver and then when it runs out of glycogen it's going to start breaking down muscle or even before it runs out of glycogen because if there's enough cortisol the body is just gonna pull glucose resources from anywhere it can so it breaks down glycogen from the liver it breaks down muscle protein to make glucose the glucose goes into the blood glucose the blood sugar increases and now we have more blood sugar to go to the muscles to handle the stress to wherever the body needs the resources whether it's real or imagined but now we also need insulin to get that sugar out of the bloodstream and into the cell to deliver it to its target the other thing that cortisol does is it inflammation so there's a drug there's a synthetic version of cortisol called cortisone or prednisone and people can get this as a medication and now they give it to reduce systemic inflammation so people with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory diseases of various kinds they get prednisone if they have pain from inflammation they get cortisone or prednisone if people have swollen inflamed joints they get cortisone injections and what that does of course it reduces inflammation why does it do that why does cortisol stop inflammation because when you're in a fight flight your body is concerned with survival in this moment and inflammation is part of the healing process that takes place after your back to safety so right now we're trying to survive tomorrow we're gonna worry about inflammation and healing when we're safe so in the acute stage cortisol shuts down inflammation and that's why this is used as an anti-inflammatory drug but of course what this drug does it increases blood sugar it increases insulin it makes people gain weight in the midsection and make people swell up it makes people pre-diabetic and so forth we also said that cortisol breaks down protein it's destructive to protein so this is why these people are gonna get thin legs because it breaks down the large muscle groups first they're gonna get a flat butt because that's another large muscle group the skin also has protein in the collagen so when we break down that protein now we get stretch marks because the skin is not as strong and elastic as it used to be we bruise easily because the tissue is very fragile so any little bump we get we're going to break the tissue and get a bruise because cortisol broke down the protein so all of these body type characteristics and and the bruising and the stretch marks is because of cortisol so if we have a lifestyle where we start looking like this then chances are really really high that we have excess cortisol so when I saw all these videos to talk about a flat stomach and nine exercises to a flat stomach in seven days and so forth it really is frustrating because they give people the wrong idea they give people false hope they give people the idea that if they don't end up with a flat stomach then they're just not trying hard enough and then they get guilty but there is no quick fix you're not going to turn this around in nine days or three weeks or overnight like these videos suggest so do we want to do exercise yes and we've talked about that in other videos or sit-ups gonna do it no our sit-ups good yes do some core strength do some sit-ups do some crunches because it's good to have a strong core that fires up and strengthens the brain so what kind of exercise do you want to do well aerobics are good except and please understand this the thing we call aerobics is not aerobic exercise when you go to a spin class when you go to an aerobics class with an instructor with an upbeat music tempo that encourages you that motivates you to go faster and faster and sweat and huff and puff and that is not aerobic exercise that's an aerobic exercise and again we've talked about these in other videos that if you huff and puff now you're making cortisol you are making this worse so exercise is good but if you exercise and you trigger additional cortisol now you are depositing additional body fat you are triggering cortisol to raise blood sugar that will trigger insulin and the insulin and the cortisol are going to put the weight right back where you started from so if you have anything like this body type or if you have anything like adrenal fatigue then do not do any exercise where you huff and puff and the only exception is high-intensity interval training which you can do a little bit and watch those videos to understand that part so if we have intra-abdominal fat or if we have a large amount of subcutaneous fat that's a result of hormones and the exercise cannot be in such a way as to stimulate those two hormones because then you're gonna make it worse at best you'll be able to burn off a few extra calories you will feel good because you sweated and you made some hormones and so forth but now you just pushed your body back into carbohydrate metabolism and you're gonna get cravings and you might be able to withstand those cravings for a few days or a few weeks but because you're shifting your body to a carb metabolism because you're not addressing the underlying issue you will not be able to sustain it and then you feel guilty because you couldn't keep it up so just don't go there we have to get over the idea of no pain no gain all right pain is stress stress triggers cortisol and it will put us right back in this situation the only time that there's some benefit to some pain with exercise is if you're trying to get fit if you try to be at peak performance for a specific event if you're gonna do Ironman or if you're doing something in in track and field where you need to produce a lot of lactic acid in a short period of time like 400 meters or 1500 meters then you're gonna have to go through some pain to get really fit but if you're looking to be healthy there is no need for that so how do we reverse the underlying mechanism we do the things that will reduce insulin that will reduce cortisol step number one eat less sugar go to a low carb high fat diet and even a ketogenic diet on how insulin resistance you are depending on how long it's been there most people will benefit from being in ketosis a good amount of the time some people don't necessarily need to go there all the time but I think it's a great place to see how it works for you and then maybe alternate between keto and and low carb you want to combine it with intermittent fasting because sugar and carbohydrate are the root cause that drive the insulin and eating carbohydrates and sugar many times a day will stimulate sugar storage fat storage many times a day so intermittent fasting is where you eat less carb in fact you eat zero carbs when you're fasting and you're eating fewer meals so you're stimulating this process fewer times you're giving it a chance to reverse itself so these are tools that you can use low carb keto and intermittent fasting they're increasing power in that order so low carb is powerful keto is more powerful intermittent fasting is most powerful then you want to add some low intensity exercise meaning truly aerobic exercise when you are not huffing and puffing if you go for a walk if you go for an easy bike ride or if you're rollerblading if you're not huffing and puffing you are keeping up your breathing slowly that's aerobic with air and when you're aerobic when you're providing oxygen at a rate that you can metabolize fuel your body burns primarily fat especially if your fat adapted then the vast majority of fuel is going to come from fat and that's what you want you want to lose the belly fat as soon as you start huffing and puffing you switch from burning fat to burning carbohydrates and it's not like you're burning a hundred percent of one and zero of the other and vice versa but it's the dominance so in aerobic exercise you burn predominantly fat in huffing and puffing and aerobic exercise you predominantly carbohydrate and sugar so low intensity exercise is the key and that's where you want to spend a lot of time you can do that 30 minutes a day if you have time and you feel like it then you can do it 60 or 90 or 120 minutes a day it is not fatiguing it's not exhausting because you're operating within your threshold within your capacity for aerobic training so you have infinite fuel you have all the oxygen in the world and you have all the fat on your body to provide fuel for that you're not gonna run out of fuel then you want to add a little bit of hit high-intensity interval training and here we're talking very very high intensity so there's a little bit of pain maybe but you're doing it for such a short time it's just fun to push yourself a little bit we're talking seconds you do 15 20 30 seconds at a time you relax rest for a few seconds and then you hit it again and you only do that four or five times to get your heart rate up close to your maximum and then you're done the whole workout is like five minutes and what that does it does produce cortisol but it does it for such a short period of time that it doesn't affect your overall situation and the benefits is that you increase your growth hormone by three to four hundred percent and growth hormone is muscle sparing and it is fat burning all right so if you can make three to four times more growth hormone then you're gonna accomplish both of those goals you kind of do the opposite of what the court is all does so yes you're gonna produce cortisol during the hit but the cortisol is for a few minutes the growth hormone lasts for days and the other thing that's going to produce a lot of growth hormone is fasting so doing these two together is going to put you in the best place possible for growth hormone number 5 cortisol is produced in response to stress so we could have stress from exercise and aerobic huffing and puffing exercise but we can also have it from emotional stress anytime that you feel frustrated tense upset angry etc overwhelmed you are in stress your body makes cortisol your blood sugar goes up and this blood sugar is there for you to be able to deal with fight and flight for you to be able to increase your energy energy expenditure to get out of a dangerous situation but if you have emotional stress from your lifestyle situation when you're sitting in traffic if you have too many deadlines if the kids are screaming and you feel stressed now you're making cortisol which raises blood sugar but you're not going to do any additional exercise in that moment to use up the glucose so now that excess glucose gets into the cell by insulin and you're not going to use it so it gets turned back into fat so cortisol turns sugar into fat cortisol turns protein into fat and where does it gather up where does it deposit in the midsection that's what cortisol does stress management is enormous Lea important and for some people that might be as important as doing all the other stuff together so we want to understand that there are can be multiple components and for different people they could be the primary the key one could be different for different people so we want to optimize our chances we do all of them of course that's just how it works if something makes you healthier then do all of those things so how do you get rid of belly fat by reversing the underlying mechanism and can you do it without exercise yes would you want to know because exercise is not optional but you want to do it without the wrong kind of exercise because the wrong kind of exercise will perpetuate the problem if you enjoyed this video you're going to love this video thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time", "R7qSiEKntQA": "hi everyone I'm Alex Honnold and this is the breakdown let's start with Mission Possible - this is actually my favorite I love this thing I actually filmed in this exact location once upon a time I shot a commercial right here and when we rappelled in we found plastic holes bolted to the wall and the only explanation was this is where they shot Mission Impossible was like a classic red sandstone towers are all southern Utah maybe northern Arizona that's the the white rim below him it's a confluence at the Green River at the Colorado River but I mean I think they're cutting between a bunch of different places and a bunch of different spires the W bar is illegitimate rest I mean that's like a legit way to rest rock climbing I definitely listen to music when I've found sometimes I mean you know if you have some cool soundtrack behind you while you're sending I mean how cool is that this is completely outrageous but kind of amazing I mean especially looking down here like other plenty of holes above them but no he just has to jump 15 feet sideways to a different shelf there is a history of Cour jumping sort of in climbing but it's typically if you sum it aspire and then you have to get off of it but you never just randomly jump from the middle of one wall to the middle of another wall for no real reason  that's all kind of legit the whole sliding down just like oh gosh and then catching the whip if something is actually somewhat realistic I mean that's probably not even his hand you know if he was that cut up from having climbed halfway up a tower you probably shouldn't be climbing the tower without a robe typically if you have huge wounds on your fingers it's because you have poor technique and cracks I mean there's no way that Tom Cruise ripped those bigger chunks of his fingers I pride myself in good technique I do not have scars in my hands but I mean I got it just came from the climbing gym actually so I'm still chalky I'll be hanging by one hand on the lip of a sandstone thing extremely unrealistic but so rad I mean the reverse Iron Cross so rad and then notice that they just cut to epic sunset light and then oh now they're back to normal light but he looks so good at the sunset I mean nobody soul is like that on sandstone because it breaks I did this expedition in Chad and Africa once upon a time the climbing ax and Stern Tower is similar to this but worse rock because I was free soloing this tower that never been climbing for and both my footholds broke off at the same time like big plates of sandstone just like sheared away from the wall and so I was left just hanging there by my hands like oh my goodness total mission impossible craziness style so sick and this is actually pretty legit climbing like that's pretty decent movement he's got cool heel toe cam and he's like rocking over his foot I mean he looks you know okay his stunt double for all this was this guy Ron calc who's that you cemani legend from the 70s and 80s I mean I think that's why that you know they brought a high level of expertise to to this type of scene I think the reason I love this scene so much is that it's basically all there I mean it's Rio I mean he's on real rock he's doing real moves like it looks cool it's just totally over the top it's like turned up to 11 I mean he's you know he's shooting a rocket it's like he could've just sent him a text message but instead he's sending a rocket you know how you just snapchatted him and it's gonna self-destruct him ten seconds whatever I mean it's all it's all turned up to 11 a lot of my friends worked on Point Break and I've heard all about it I've seen the film but I watch on the plane I felt free to a lot of it's like not to create a film all right let's see it I'm like this is why I don't like climbing in the jungle because I mean that's just wet and covered in frigging boss and I like he's got an evolved shirt on he must be able to jake weimer we just funny cuz all my friends that were working on it responds to by evolved the time so I'm sure they were just hooking up the crews okay well so the pop I spotted okay so I mean what they were initially doing there is all just easy easy approach climbing basically what you do to get over some little cascade or something now they just cut to this dude is now suddenly a thousand feet off the ground actually rock climbing a technical terrain this is completely different know what he was doing two seconds ago he's actually live back in so you see that his body is arced in his foot he's basically counter-pressure between his hands pulling one-wayness foot facing the other way it's actually a great way to pose because it opens your body up to the camera you know this is all legit technique I mean he's climbing he's climbing up in a row looks good so this is a different type of Rocky and this is quartzite super feature and supposed to be super cool a lot of friends that have climbed on this wall in Venezuela things is cutting so quickly back and forth between random things that you don't really get a good sense of what they're actually climbing it's all realistic and except he's free so hugging a waterfall which is not realistic oh that's some extreme double die knowing right there that was sick well a dino is when you jump and then a double die knows when you jump with both hands oh so he just died knit - I mean this is a hospital this is epic oh he's about to die the whole hang with one hand and flailing with the other that's not a thing like no climber has ever done that basically because it's really really hard to hang on with one hand and so you can't just like flail your other hand basically if you're hanging on the - and you lose one of them you're basically just gonna fall off and die and spastically trying to grab on with the other hand and not being able to like that doesn't even make any sense because it's not hard to just grab back on next year hand oh my goodness gracious he just felt his death whoa is that a thing why are they that's definitely not a thing most soulless would not just let go and fall hood if you let me start trying to down climb yeah you whoa this is skip ethnic you just do the full Rose move iron cross thing this is getting really extreme I mean what they're climbing is not easy of course I'm not actually climbing it but but it looks sick Oh mono sick that's one of the more dramatic types of holes in climbing from French wanted well just you know one finger in there it's like a little hole in the rock so you can only fit one I mean you can just hang from one finger if you have strong metal fingers some of those shots you can see em hang it from to on you know like a big two finger on one hand small two finger on the other alternating things like that or sometimes front to or back to or middle to you know depends what you're telling the truth this is such a crazy scene I think this scene could have been better if it was more tastefully done like you didn't like that it's completely outrageous but doesn't look very dramatic I think that's Chris Sharma climbing in that one move it actually looks like the way Chris Moo's he's he's one of the most dynamic climbers on rock wait let's see that again that's a full cramp right there and and he had to there because it's a very small hole very hard to hold and so he rolls it in to get full power on it like basically the three grips that you're grabbing the edge if this is the edge you can go open-handed where your fingers are open you can go like half crimp or a full crimp where you close your hand into a full fist basically and your thumb comes over because your thumb is a finger so I mean if you think of your you know it's basically 20% stronger if you wrap your thumb over it and crank down on your fingers it's it's relatively realistic climbing they're doing real things I mean it is you know a couple the world's best climbers climbing on is one of the most and present walls in the world so it is kind of amazing but it's just all too over the top and sort of outrageous I'm kind of over this clip this clip size this is from my childhood I would like this let's see it so this is this is legitimately the beginning ball cap and he's actually climbing this is the beginning of the three Ryder actually this is what I started up yeah this is what I crew told him which is funny because now it's showing him over on the nose which is a root that's there two hundred feet to the right this is called chimney counter-pressure between two different walls this is totally legit totally normal so this is a root called outer limits at the cookie cliff which is down valley ten miles and then this is separate reality which is another random cliff and disseminate this is also not an El Cap but it still looks cool I've actually posed for photos and basically that same place because you can just dangle off the live and it looks sick the camera guy should've been further left and you'd see the valley behind him rewind a little further yeah so when you're climbing a crack you basically put your hand in and then you change the shape your hand to conform to the crack pressure between the meat of your thumb in the back of your hand is what constricts you into the crack and then if a crack is bigger than then that size then you can basically cup your hand and now you get pressure between the back of your hand like your knuckles in and your fingers flush thumb and then if it's too big for that then you start getting weird things where you can make a fist or like you don't think fist or if it's too big for your fist then you start doing two hands or you know hand in a fist or stacking your hands it's called and that's why crack climbing is fundamentally one of the safest feelings and in free solar you feel like you your bones are locked into the wall and you're not actually using any muscles to hold on but at least this is tastefully done you know it's not like over the top it's not turned up to 11 I mean you know there's okay if it's beautiful he's climbing so he's going up the side of the booth like this is the nose right now yeah I mean this is much closer to real rock climbing and especially real free soloing he's moving exciting more methodically he's placing his feet carefully he's you know moving with with intention it's not like crazy jumping around I mean this is what free soloing looks like and then this is just some random studio concrete thing this isn't even real rock El Cap is granite you somebody is all granite and normally that means that it's beautiful sheer clean really nice well-formed rock the what he's holding on to right there is just concrete mold or you know some kind of weird fake thing and granite is the most inspiring because it forms these big mess eaves that are really impressive I regret inform you that the record for free climbing El Capitan is in no danger of being broken that's a classic misuse of free climbing versus free solely because he's free soloing but he just called it free climbing free climbing means using your hands and your feet to climb up the wall but also using a rope or protection the free soloing means that your free climbing by yourself which means that you're not using anything to assist you and you don't have a partner and so you want to rope either because it's their classic Mallory quote oh now he's falling to his death and that is El Cap behind him I think they actually did some kind of crazy multi hundred foot rope vaulting for that shot I think Star Trek 5 is pretty legit pretty realistic particularly for having been made thirty years ago whenever it was the original El Cap free solo I never heard of this I'm like that's a real climbing rope oh wow this is a terrible blade but he's doing a legitimate clip really bad oh there's a dragon I think the scariest thing is when you put your hand into a crack and a bat hisses back at you because bats make this super high pitch and the snakes and spiders and things actually potentially depending where you are in the world could potentially kill you an acquaintance in you somebody got bitten by rattlesnake on top of a boulder but that's just bad luck this is all surprisingly realistic in a lot of ways one of my friends has a classic story basically that exactly happening that like the Blair gets pulled all the way to the wall and slams into the wall the climber Falls super far there's tons of slack meant on the drag and all the distance of the Blair getting pulled upward not that unrealistic  I didn't totally understand that I mean he has a rope but it's like weird that he swings so much and he broke a rock I don't totally get it but like why isn't wiring his feet on and then when it cuts to that it looks like a totally different type of rock than the inside of the well it's all sort of weird better performance without a rope kind of not really the way it seems like a bit of a stretch that if you weren't able to do it with a rope you take the rope away and now you can do it I'm like no it's because that all looks pretty easy I mean the hold hanging onto that stuff is easy but the stuff below the card overall I think it's kind of hokey I don't really get it oh this is one of the worst scenes that all of Hollywood climbing that's in the volume on your safety [Music]  nothing about this would ever ever happen if your gear withstood the initial impact of stopping five people you know if you think force is mass times acceleration if you decelerate five people following super far down the wall once they stop it's not as if there's any more force being generated on the piece of gear that held them you know if it held it once it's not just gonna fall out after I mean in general climbing accidents are sort of this all-or-nothing like eat it happens or doesn't if it happens it all goes bad and if it doesn't in the member it's fine it's trying to place another piece of gear which makes sense because if all your lives are hanging off one piece of gear you definitely wanna place a backup but this whole thing a bit flexing and it moving I mean that doesn't really make sense cuz once it's fully loaded it's fully loaded feel bad for the gear manufacturers because any climber sees that and they're like oh that's metolius orange cam like everyone knows what they're using or sort of like it's kind of poor form to just like throw some climbing manufacturer under the bus and this is all kind of crazy the fact that they're hanging out in space because they're basically aren't any sandstone walls in the whole world that are overhanging the whole way like that so they should be touching the wall and this is the type of situation where each of them should be like let's take one deep breath compose ourselves and do the right thing which is never to cut the rope and cut your partner means ticular that's your father so that is or maybe that's the what he just died that sucks that might be in Manama silence but everything about the scene is horrendous because I mean this is probably the worst scene in all of Hollywood climbing well this isn't climbing this is freerunning oh God but well this is ice he's coming he's barehanded he's they're gonna glacier I don't I don't know I don't understand what's happening but you can't really climb ice barehanded this isn't a thing whoa this is Savage you definitely can't just hang off in high school with your hand that's not a thing everything about this is totally outrageous I mean if you had to get onto this glacier somehow you definitely walk around yeah I've definitely climbed ice but I mean if you were faced with an obstacle like this above you you definitely go around it you would never just go over it like this this isn't a thing I don't even is this even in the movie I don't remember this at all this looks so bad this is actually probably the least realistic thing we've seen so far that was horrible but the thing is there a lot of other fun scenes and cliffhanger that I think are kind of classic and kind of kind of interesting my overall thoughts are that typically in a Hollywood movie it's all for entertain any way it's not really trying to be realistic and so everything's always turned up you know dialed up way too extreme and I think that maybe some subtlety might make some of the scenes more powerful in fact I mean I think you know certainly if you see free solar I mean I think it's pretty gripping and because it's subtly you know because it's tastefully done I think that the most realistic scene in any Hollywood movie is Clint Eastwood climbing a desert towering in the Eiger sanction and actually in general climbing the eye that all the climbing in the Eiger sanction is very realistic like I could talk about climbing all day like sorry guys", "IW9hz1kZP2I": "one of the most common myths that I hear is that if unused muscle tissue converts into fat it's really important to say that the muscle tissue has muscle cells and fat tissue has fat cells they are not interchangeable by no means is it chemically or physically possible for muscle tissue to convert over to fat and vice versa fat into muscle that's Jean kike Meister I'm a clinical athletic trainer at the New York sport science lab in Staten Island New York and he's one of three athletic trainers we brought in to our studios my name is Janelle Mason my name is an easter to debunk 17 of the most common exercise myths it really depends on your goals training fasted in the morning is more conducive to losing fat because when you wake up you're in a fasted state and that means your body is basically consuming itself so it's looking at fat storage it's looking at muscle storage that's the time where if your goal is to lose weight and just slim down lean down that's the best time to optimize that window for training but in terms of effectiveness of training in general I don't think it really matters you just need to make sure that if you are training at night you are not fatiguing yourself throughout the day so when most people think stretching their thinking static stretching you achieve a certain position you hold that position and your goal is to increase your range of motion a problem with that is you can end up really loose and if you follow that type of stretching with something explosive or something ballistic or something strength based you now have a loose tissue or you have a lacks joint and you're not going to be able to produce as much force and you could also potentially lead yourself to being injured because you're not as stable  so what my favorite is when it's the holidays right and you have you know that aunt or uncle that's just like yeah I'm just trying to lose it like right here and they start pinching the lower abdomen oh my god Greek you can't spot reduce the part that you want and in good news it doesn't go the other way either it's not like when I eat a cheeseburger it's gonna go right to my right yeah and if you are trying to lower your body fat cardio isn't the best way to do it cardio doesn't burn fat cardio burns calories so if your goal is to lose weight you want to be in a caloric deficit so as a part of getting into that caloric deficit doing cardiovascular exercises is helpful but if you're not eating a diet or if you're not monitoring your caloric intake on top of that and making sure that you are in that deficit no amount of cardio that you do you can't outrun a bad diet and in fact doing too much cardio can actually be a bad thing if all you're doing is cardio with the goal of losing weight you can start to burn into that muscle tissue so if you're burning into your lean muscle tissue now you could actually be slowing down your metabolism you could be decreasing your bone density and you could be making yourself weaker and that's why I think this myth is potentially the most dangerous and damaging one for the general population but it may not be as common as the belief that I love this one one myth I hear all the time is that muscle weighs more than fat a pound of bricks weighs the same as a pound of feathers so it's not that muscle weighs more than fat it's that muscle is more dense than fat so in terms of you building muscle you can add weight on the scale the scale isn't necessarily the best indicator of progress when we're trying to develop our physique and oftentimes at first you can add muscle and the scale will reflect that you're heavier but over time understanding that for all the lean muscle you have you're increasing your resting calories burn per day that's a long-term sustainable change in your body as opposed to just doing cardio sessions and going into caloric deficit and starving yourself of course building muscle isn't just for men women think that they'll bulk up if they start working out and if that's the look you're going for I think that's great because you're doing something that you want to do but if you are working out for general wellness and health I don't want you to be afraid to lift heavy weights you're not going to get bulky by nature and in fact weight lifting is especially important for women as we age we become more prone to getting osteoporosis so we definitely need to be doing resistance training where our muscles are feeling that stimulation so that the bones nearby can remain strong and whether you're a man or a woman you don't actually need weights at all to build strengths I mean the myth being that you have to go to the gym to be doing strength training it's crazy all right your body is a weight so bodyweight exercises have been around forever and they are so important be able to push up your body or crunch or squat or pull up and if it's a six pack year after the muscles themselves aren't even that important getting a six pack is not about doing tons of cartridges a lot of it has to do with your nutrition and Stearn agrees abs are made in the kitchen the abs are a muscle if you're gonna target the muscle by doing crunches leg lifts bicycle crunches oblique twists you're essentially building the muscle so think of it as you're building the engine of the car and then the outside is your body fat and how do you show off the inside of the car you've got to reduce that body fat so sweating a lot means you got a really great workout it's something I hear all the time unfortunately that's not true either some people are just naturally more prone to sweating some people just have underactive sweat glands so it means that you're healthy and your filtration system but it doesn't necessarily reflect the effectiveness of your workout but if you do sweat a lot how should you replenish I would not say that most commercial sports drinks are the most efficient way of rehydrating following a workout but plain water isn't going to cut it either if you're just consuming water too that's also not the most effective way of hydrating because hydration is not just water there's also trace minerals that as electrolytes which help with nerve conduction they help with brain function they have but muscular contraction so if you're looking for the best way to rehydrate post-workout it could be very beneficial to add just a dab of pink Himalayan sea salt to water a pink Himalayan sea salt has over 60 trace minerals all of which are found naturally in human sweat so when you consider something like a Gatorade or Powerade they may have four or five different electrolytes in their blends so Derrick falling drastically short in terms of overall hydration when it comes to all the minerals of your body and after a workout you should also eat protein immediately right if you already have a protein rich diet you don't need to worry so much about downing a protein shake right after your workout now what you are going to be depleted of though especially if you're doing an aerobic exercise you're going to be depleted of glycogen glycogen is the immediate form of energy for muscle contraction and that comes in way of simple carbohydrates and sugars so post-training it's important to replenish that glycogen but even if you're fueling muscles with a proper diet they still need time off hashtag no days off the old myth that we should not take a day off is an extreme there's a huge value in letting the muscle repair itself right so every time you do let's go back to the bicep curl if I'm doing a bicep curl a small tear is gonna happen in my bicep so the body is going to repair itself because again it's a machine who knows how to to survive and if I continue to do it I don't have a window of opportunity for the body the soldiers to jump in alright let's fix this tear because it's just constantly me more so it needs some of that downtime to again to heal itself especially if you're sore that's a myth for sure soreness is the breakdown of muscle tissue it's the chemicals released during that breakdown it's not an indicator of oh I'm getting stronger oh I'm getting weaker but if you're soreness persists for longer than 72 hours that could be a sign that you're under recovering or overtraining one month is not enough to undo a lifetime of bad habits so it's important to start slow find the things that you enjoy find the physical activities that make you feel good make that a daily habit and there's no one-size-fits-all approach there's not one type of movement that you should be doing that is better than the other so if you enjoy dancing go out and dance go out dancing three times a week or do a dance cardio class or something that gets you moving if you like to jump on trampolines do that I think the best movement for anyone to do is something that they enjoy because the only way that you're gonna stick to your work out being a lifestyle for you is for you to be doing something you enjoy", "G2A-185WViw": "", "ji_ukN8rtg4": "(music) It's an important workout.

(music) There's only one book that matters, Austin! Tell him that book, Dan! The good old bible. Best seller, every year, for 2,000 years. (music) I really, really want to punch someone and I really want to be punched, but I don't want it to be in a fight and I don't want it to be hard feelings, I want it to be like a mutual I can punch you and you can punch me kind of thing. I can't believe this. (laughter) (music) I could never even describe the feeling of winning the CrossFit Games. It's still so\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpeople are like, so how does it feel and I'm like ... I just feel a rush of emotions. And it's like, it's the best feeling in the world. And everyday I strive to find that feeling again. Sometimes when I'm stressed I start breaking myself down. Like, oh my gosh, you can't do this. These girls are all so good and you're just Sara. Now when I'm training, I'm just thinking, are you going to let this happen again? Are you going to be secure that you can do everything? Or are you going to be the girl that always loses when she's under pressure or something? Let's do the grenade, OK? (speaking Icelandic) Nice. (laughter) They've clearly never seen a grenade before. (laughter) Why are we so ugly like this?  No, we're beautiful. We're beautiful inside. (laughter) I'll probably not do too much. I'm still sore from doing the last workout on Monday. Working out's always more fun. When you're not alone. (music) I always said before that, like, CrossFit would never be my Number 1 priority, that school will always be priority, then I'll have a job and CrossFit will be on the side. It was during the 2014 season I worked a desk job and it was pretty quickly after that that I was like, eh, I'm going to push all my chips into this CrossFit thing. It's a true teller because 275 lb. is a heavy power clean for me. (music) Double tap on that second one. Thanks for doing that with me.  Yeah. Now we're going to go shoot guns and ride motorcycles. This is my walk in sing, definitely. Definitely. What's yours, Mat? I was cracking up, I just thought, \"Hood Mentality\" by Ice Cube. There you go, that's good. Fits you. Fuck school, I'm gonna be a dope dealer. (laughter) Yeah, yeah. I'll probably just play whatever Mat does right before he does it. Ben Smith. I'm in the background\u00e2\u20ac\u201dahhhhh. Bro?! Aw, look at Fraser, what a douche. Using the same song as Ben, what a tool. I used to listen to a lot of rap, but now it's like I can't even understand what they're saying. And I can't really relate to what they're saying either so I'm like, eh, I'm good. Even if you look at the lyrics, I'm like this sentence doesn't make sense. That's a fragment, that's a run-on sentence. ... hard being Snoop D-O- double G but I somehow, some way ... (singing) (music) Ian: Dude, that thing is freakin' in there. Good dudes, fast motorcycles, what's not to like? Don't eat that. You don't need that.  No?  Nope. Mini Perfect Bars. We don't have them in Iceland, come on. Food for one day. I think you two have eaten more food than any of the other athletes. They make no room for time to eat here. We need our food, come on. Girl's gotta eat. So I was going to be really clever and use the coffee machine to make oatmeal this morning, and I'm very clumsy with everything, so I'll talk you through this. First step,  so I'm getting the water here. Then I went to the bathroom, came back, annnnnd it fell on the floor. And all the floor was in oatmeal and cinnamon. Second attempt, it worked and I was like, OK, how should I eat this? So I didn't have a spoon so I drank the oats. And then to make it up to the maids, I left a little tip, I'm sorry. Poor maids. Let's make it an AMRAP, team. What, Rich goes team and now everyone has to do team workouts? I don't care, I'm just working out. James you slept in until like 9 o'clock. Austin, once again, I am on vacation. I'm allowed to sleep until whenever I want. James is sensitive. I can't wait for this video to make it somewhere so all the bodybuilders can make fun of us and how bad we are at bench. (music) Ian: Made it through security.  Yeah. Smile and wave. Announcer: Two of Iceleand's strongest Dottirs here. You're going to pause, give everybody a little wave ... Once Dave makes his announcement and it's done, you'll have 10 minutes before we start the workout. Why do we have lifting platforms? There's room for handstand walk over here. Just saying. Maybe it's DT. I am so excited about being in the Open announcement. They're going to throw something at us and we're going to have to deal with it. Yeah, it's going to be pretty stressful but it's going to be a lot of fun. Contrary to popular belief, we do not know the workout until everybody else finds out I found out what the workout is when you find out what the workout is. I'm kind of plan for the worst, hope for the best. I have some bad workout in my head so that when he announces it, hopefully it's not that bad. But, I don't know, it's probably going to be terrible. Ladies and gentlemen, live from Schriever Air Force Base ... Live from Aromas, California, where it all began. And this is the announcement of 16.4. Castro: 16.5 is ... 14.5. 16.4 is ... a chipper. Sean Woodland: It's go time and we've never had these three on this floor in this setting. Castro: 3, 2, 1 ... go! 16.4 is open and ready for fitness. We are underway at The Ranch in Aromas, California. The only time you're going to see these guys going head to head. Sara off the deadlifts first, Sigmundsdottir has just a slight edge on Katrin Davidsdottir. Right now Mat Fraser and Rich Froning are trading the lead and Ben Smith is just about a half rep behind. She is finishing her set of 55 wall balls and she'll miss just hitting the bottom of the target and that might leave a little bit of room for Davidsdottir to catch up. Mat Fraser now slightly ahead of Rich Froning who's keeping that steady pace. Sara Sigmundsdottir has Katrin by 13 and she will move into her 55 handstand push-ups. He can put himself into that really dark place. He right now is ahead of Rich's time from 2014. Davidsdottir will join Sigmundsdottir on the wall. She is done with her final repetition and will work her way back down the chipper. Mat Fraser is making a statement in Aromas. Can Sigmundsdottir get through the deadlifts at the buzzer?! Fraser has bragging right and a whole lot of confidence and that could be dangerous in July. Sara Sigmundsdottir will take 16.4. Ian, I broke my nail. Really proud of you. That was the best competition I've seen you do. Awesome, man. Really well done. I barely ever looked over. That's what we were looking for. That was so hard. I just wanna look. A peek here or there is not going to crush anything. It's is that going to affect your performance? Really proud of that, too. All right, we're going to go squat. I did better than I did the last time I did it. I think I just checked, I got like 9:16, so I did improve. Just kind of go and try to hang on. I knew I probably couldn't beat him but I was going to try to bait him, see if I could bait him on that first set of thrusters and just go hard and try to hang on so, uh, whatever, it happens. I mean, I'm not surprised that he beat us on that workout. Last year during the Open was the fittest I've ever been in my life. But then by the time I'm 2 weeks out of regionals and I'm like oh my god, I'm burning out. This year, I'm not as fit as I was but I'm ramping back up in the right direction. I think I'm on a good timeline. I mean, I want to win the Games again, that'd be ideal. I may win, I may not win, it's totally up in the air but I'm going to do my best to do it again. (music) Froning: I love what I'm doing right now. I kind of play it year by year. I don't really have a set goal of how long I want to do this. As long as I'm not either bringing my team down or just making an idiot of myself, I'll keep doing it. The feeling of winning the CrossFit Games is the best feeling you can imagine. That's something I strive for everyday. It would mean the world to me to win again. (music) Your head is like 80 percent of your success. So, my head is good. I can definitely win it.", "g72SmMdFBpk": "I don\u2019t care if you will live or die, I really do not care. It is tough to hear from someone you don't know well, (Laughter) But imagine if you hear this from someone you love. On the twenty-fourth of February 2012, I was diagnosed with throat cancer late. in this night, I came home and sat at the table with my daughter and wife, I am trying to conceal fear And I inform them about upcoming actions. Then I pushed my daughter away from the table and said: \"I don't care if you will live or die.\" There was a lot of anger and screaming through the closed doors, And tonight while I was trying to sleep, It made me think about it, and I started thinking: \"Why don't you see what you gave her and what you did for her?\" I was a radio journalist, One day, I was a news anchor on a big show. And I became a reporter. Then I became a reporter in foreign countries, and we traveled around the world. We moved from the county prairie frost to the warmth of Sydney, Australia, To be able to cover Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. She couldn't understand how she hadn't seen what she had given her, But while I was lying and steeped in my beliefs, I began to see the truth, and the truth was ... That I couldn't remember the last time she embraced her and made her feel safe, Or the last time I told her how proud I was, Or the last time I said to her, \"I love you.\" And I suddenly realized that the cancer had already reached beyond my throat. After a few weeks I was in the hospital To perform what doctors call a radical neck resection: They grabbed the scalpel and began cutting behind the right ear Even below the Adam's apple, he was wounded 12 inches long. They had to remove a golf-sized tumor. And while I was recovering, And I pray to a god I did not believe in, \"Let me finish what I am,\" The surgeon came and told me it was not over, And that I have to undergo chemotherapy and radiation for several weeks. Back then, I felt I needed to be close to people; Because I was more afraid than ever, And I decided to go for chemotherapy and radiation sessions on my own And I miss an opportunity to tell my wife and daughter: \"I'm so scared, please go with me.\" I was longing to be near them, but I was pushing them away to die anyway. (Sigh) I used to go to radiotherapy every day, I couldn\u2019t go home to find myself surrounded by four walls, So I started going to the downtown areas to drown in a sea of \u200b\u200bpeople I hope this distracts me and takes me away About the thought that broke out inside my head That my departure is drawing near. We are said to be: \"When we are ready to learn, then the teacher will appear,\" But I did not know that this teacher would be a homeless homeless man. I remember the first time I saw him He was miserable and sits on a piece of cardboard at a busy intersection With his little dog sitting next to him and next to him a large banner reading \"Help me.\" And when I first saw him, the first thing I thought about was: \"How dare you? You must look for a job. how dare you? You are not a victim more than me. Look at me, I have cancer and I will probably die. I have been with young children in chemotherapy sessions. They are the victims, not you. \" During the following days, I was watching him while I was walking back and forth, and I was trying to engage people, I have never seen him reach out or beg anyone in public Or behaving aggressively, But he seemed nice, and he greeted and greeted the people around him. And one day, on my way home, You are on the same side of the road as you sit. Normally, I would have crossed the other side to avoid facing it, Or maybe to avoid prejudices about it, But today I said, \"No, I'm going to go.\" And when I started getting close to him, His little dog got up, stood in front of me Then he sat down and looked at me in a friendly look. (Laughter) I extended my hand to him and raised him, and then I turned to the man. Without thinking, she spoke freely and asked him bod: \"What is his name?\" He laughed and said: \"Okay, you mean what her name is, and her name is Molly.\" (Laughter) \"It usually doesn't stop people unless they need something. What do you need? Well, I wish I was so good in my thoughts ... (Laughter) The first thing in my mind is: \"A good trick. It manipulates my heart and evokes my feelings.\" (Laughter) Instead, I told him, \"She must have known that I needed a cute dog to play with him today.\" And she walked away. I was confused; I was confused about a lot of things. The day after radiotherapy, I realized I wanted to go back To replace it, do something, or find out something. I wanted to give him something, but not money Because we know what happens when we give someone a money beggar, He will spend it on drugs or alcohol. I stopped to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee And some biscuits for Molly, When I got close to him, he waved at me and said, \"I see you came back again for Molly.\" I was about to give him food and things, But he preceded me and reached out to shake hands with me. Meanwhile, he started talking to me As if we have known each other for a long time. I sat with him and gave him a sandwich, so he told me: \"I will only take it if we share it.\" Spanish poet Kivedo once wrote: \"The misery goes away when we share the bread.\" There was no misery on this day. We sat down and spoke as old comrades and for a moment I forgot that I was sick. After a little while, he reached out to his bag and pulled out a small box of grain, His hands were shaking and he couldn't open it, so I offered him to open it. He gave it to me, so I looked and found his name on it, Douglas. The name of the medicine was \"Largactel\". Which is used for people with schizophrenia, And I thought that meant he was definitely a mentally disturbed serial killer ... (Laughter) What is that? This is an internal prison, People get very little government support, We ignore them and brand them. I turned to him and said, \"Is this why you are begging?\" He looked at me and said, \"What? No, I'm here to raise money to help those in need. \" He pointed to the sign. Under the big sign \"Help Me\", which I didn't notice, There were the names of the groups for which he raised money. Suddenly, I realized that he was not the helpless person, but me. Because the judgment I made on it I was blinded by the fact that this man is kind. And I saw him a lot later. I remember that one day He had a wide smile on his face and waved his hand. He reached out to his bag to take a small box of chocolates, I ignored it because it's a cheap kind of candy, But I knew from him that she had a lot of money. So I extended my hand to the box, shook his hand and said: \"thank you my friend.\" And he started to tear, so I said, \"What's wrong with you, Doug?\" He said, \"I have no friends, Of course, I don\u2019t have important friends like you. \u201d I lived my life trying to be an important person, With TV cameras and admission. In my life, I have never felt a more important person than I did at that moment. Because I was important just because I was with him. And I told him I will only take chocolate if we share it, as we always do. We sat down And he opened them with great happiness. And while we were sitting, I was looking at a group of people passing by. Humans have places to go, people to meet and things to do, And human beings I thought I was like them, Humans were looking at us as though we were below them. I wanted to be like this for a long time, and have this vision from above, But now, as I sit down, And I eat the best chocolate I've ever had, I realize that the best vision I have is now. Sydney, Australia, is a bit cold in winter. I used to walk the city streets one winter day, wearing a coat. When I got to Doug, Lee put a milk box upside down and sat on it. Molly went up and put her paws on my knees, So I carried it, attracted me, and opened my coat, It was the first time I had exposed the long scar that was on my neck. Doug said: \"What is this?\" So I began to explain to him about cancer. He said to me, \"I know you will be okay.\" And I said, \"I feel kind of okay, I've started radiation and treated.\" He grabbed my arm, and I turned toward it So he said, \"No, you will be fine, You have a lot to do. \" I have never felt a sense of expression in my life, But I got confused that day. So I did what men do When we are touched and afraid that we will cry in front of everyone; I breathed and turned my head and tried to swallow my tears. And he was cute, and he did just as I did. We sat there, inhale, back and forth. (Laughter) I think sometimes we ... We say the best things when we don't exchange words, We just exchange places. I had to leave, But I didn't want to say goodbye to him, so I said, \"I'll see you later.\" He waved his hand and smiled. Molly stood up and sculpted for the first time. I walked this street that day with tears streaming from my eyes, Not because I was afraid or angry, but because I was happy. Because for the first time in my life, or for the first time since I had cancer, I realized that I would live. For the first time in my life, I felt I had a real goal. The next day she underwent chemotherapy. Well, chemotherapy has a way to erase any positive energy inside you. You are slowly feeding on a venomous droplet inside your body. To make matters worse, That there was a little girl sitting in front of me with a nurse next to her, She was combing horse hair game. She wore a scarf to cover her bald head, Her skin looked green, and she looked defeated. I did not want to see it Nor can I look far. Suddenly, My cute pass came when I closed my eyes, And I remembered when I was a toddler, My closest friend Rob Austin, the class clown was doing some facial expressions, She turned to her and did this ... (Laughter) This is more reaction than what I got from it. (Laughter) Do you know what small children look like when they think you are really a stranger? Well, this was how she looked at me. (Laughter) The logical thing was to turn around and pretend that this didn't happen, but ... This would have required a smart person, And I didn't say in this conversation that I'm smart. So I did the same thing again. This time I saw that her stomach started spinning until she reached her chest. I was wondering if you would feel sick and vomit, but ... (Laughter) I started to laugh. And the little boy's laugh becomes contagious, So I exploded with laughter. The nurses came from the other rooms They also started to laugh. I realized I had to see Doug and tell him: \"You're right, I still have a lot to do.\" The next day, I went back again to the city center, But he is gone. he was not there. I didn't think much, I just hoped to find a paradox. So I came back day after day, I went back for weeks, But he was not there. So I asked store owners if they had seen him, Most of them used to say: \"The homeless move to better places.\" I was calling the institutions, They were saying that they would not be able to tell me anything because of the laws protecting privacy. night, At the time I devoted it to thinking And fear about my death, I started to think about it and wonder: Was he robbed? Was he transferred to the hospital? Was he put under security surveillance? And I started thinking about Molly. Was it in a shelter? Was she about to kill her compassionately? I wanted to tell you about Doug And to give you all kinds of wonderful metaphors about what it means for me And how it will become part of the great transformation in my life, And I wanted to tell you how great it made me, But then I realized That day I was not prepared to tell Doug the full story. With the chemotherapy session that day, We had to get our seats apart Because every time we were looking at each other, we were laughing. Chemotherapy sessions continue, and you don't laugh; It kills you. The chemotherapy made me emotional, shed some tears, and I felt bitter, But I knew I couldn't leave that day, I thought I was leaving before, Before I tell her anything It could have been important and saved. When I finished the chemotherapy session, I went to her and sat cross-legged in front of her, And I looked at her face to face, and I must have looked miserable I was shaking and I felt the sweat coming out of my head. I was trying to come up with great words, And when she did, she looked at me and tipped her head, With a sympathetic view Which you can distinguish from a parent, and not from a young child, Then she reached out I put it on my cheeks to comfort me. I was the child at the time, and suddenly I started crying, She wiped tears from my face. The hardest thing was to get out there. When she looked back, she was there combing horse hair again. After several weeks, I was in chemotherapy, and I saw her nurse, so I said: \"Did you see her? How is she?\" The nurse came and told me that she had died. I thought that God took the wrong person on this day. Her story and Doug's tale have been in my heart for a long time. I began to realize that I was not afraid of death, I was afraid throughout my life. I began to realize That we all will die in a moment, But we can live a million wonderful moments And full of enthusiasm, pain, love, anxiety and anger And anything we want, And I lived half a century I avoid any negative feelings and try to distance myself For the poor, the needy and the miserable. I tried to surround myself with the rich, famous, and powerful, And I think if I become with them, I can live with this kind of safe happiness, And if you feel guilty about the homeless, Then I can wait until I make more money than I need To give them some of what I owned. But here, in my most miserable moments, So two people I've been avoiding all my life, A homeless man and a little girl, And who I thought had little to offer them, but they had given me so much. There was a lot to do, But it is not within him that he saved other people, Rather, much of what I had to do was to see others, To receive them, And give them strength to treat others. I also started the path of penance in my life with my daughter. When I was asked to make this conversation, I felt proud and humbled, But I was afraid that I was not worth it. Normally in the past, I would have told millions of people about this and would post about it, But I haven't told anyone for several weeks, except that I phoned my wife Marina She cried with me on the phone. Then I called my little girl. Now living across the country in Australia. She goes to school, She will be a teacher for children in early childhood, It will be the best because it is really good at it And her heart is big. And I told her, The same little girl who was not interested in whether I would live or die, She said to me: Dad, I'm very proud of you. And you will do all good, And I love you, Dad. \" thank you. (clap)", "ad-Kp4Lu6UI": "", "rmVz9dsMWNU": "hi this is Fred and this is my bar and these are five Easy Bar magic tricks if you like this video please click on the link below and at the end of this video please look for all of my other bar and restaurant related videos thanks for watching okay for this first trick what you're going to need is you're going to need a dime like it heads up two pieces of paper and a high bowl or a rocks glass and first let me show you the trick and then I'm going to show you how to do it and by the way this always works good that's why this bar magic is people are usually drinking at the bar and it works so much better when someone's had a a couple drinks in them all right here we go  with the dango  right there all right let's do it again  one more time if you haven't seen it  alright let's put it back real quick alright so pretty easy trick it's not really magic at all what you've done is you've taken a highball glass and you've put a piece of paper on it like that too to make it look white and then when you put it over the dime magically Boop the dime disappears so it's all how you move your hand and how you cover it to make it look like it's vanishing so I like doing it that way I've seen other people put a towel on top of it and half the glass and then the time disappears but this is how I learned it and enjoy all right for this for this next trick you're gonna need two regular straws let's give them editor plastic oh actually I have one large and one small straw let me go fix that let me get it actually will do with this so I want straw that's slightly bigger than the other but that's no problem so let me show you the trick and then I'm going to show you how I did it I'm gonna take this draw us I'm gonna tangle it tie that one around that one that's one around that one and now you've got the two straws totally intertwined Alakazam and the two straws are not broken and yet they're apart pretty cool magic trick not really magic let's show you how to do it for this trick you got the your two straws you're going to then take the first drum and make it t put your thumb there and you're gonna wrap it around too completely so it actually looks like bent just show you so you see how that's around that and just show you the bottom just like that so then you're gonna take this next one the bottom piece you're gonna wrap it to the right all the way around and come back and grab it like that then gonna take these two and just pull them over like this what it's actually doing is its untying itself so it looks like a mangled not there and then you should twist slowly twist come right apart super magic but not it's actually a really cool trick and anybody anytime anybody tries it they really get it tangled in a knot so pretty cool trick for this next trick it's a it's a card trick and this is the easiest card trick I know it's probably the very first card trick I learned when I was like 6 so I guess I wasn't even in the restaurant of our industry yet so I'm gonna just shuffle our car and then you're going to you know have your person they pick literally randomly pick any card so they pick what's just a card deck down that's your car don't let don't show it to me that's your car so then they put it on top of the deck you're gonna take the deck you're gonna put it behind your back you're gonna show them the card and say is that your card and they're gonna say no it's not you go okay so you put it back 100 you're back you cut the deck just say is that your card and they're gonna say no it's not so then you're gonna say okay give the car you give the deck to the person you're doing to trick trick to and they're gonna shuffle it or do whatever they want you can tell them to shuffle it you know look through the deck to make sure you didn't mark the deck or mark the card you can shuffle it a million times whatever and then they'll look for the card in the deck they'll give it back to you and say yes their cards in there you can cut it again or do it every one and you're going to flip through the deck and try to find their card  and then you know once you have it set up you're gonna say you know what was your card and they're gonna say it was the seven of clubs and you go yes it was so a pretty easy trick I'm gonna show you how I do it but I'm gonna show you from my my side my view I'm actually going to show you this way cuz I can't seem to get my camera to to move from there so you're literally gonna shuffle the deck and there are randomly gonna pick any card in the deck so you hold the card they could pick whatever one they want so let's say it's that card so they're gonna look at the card which I'm gonna show you and then they're gonna here and put it on the deck so they're gonna put it on the deck when you put the deck behind your back so now this is behind your back you're just gonna take the top card and flip it so you see the card which their card is the six of diamonds but when you show them and you pull it behind your back you're gonna show them the bottom card on the deck and say is that your card and as you're looking as they're looking at this card you're looking at that card so you can see it and then you go okay so that's not your card they don't know when you put the deck behind your back you're just simply gonna flip that card and just cut the deck you actually already know what they're they're carter's then you show them and say is that their car and they're gonna say no you're gonna say here right it's not your card put the deck down let them flip through it let them shuffle let them cut you already know what their card is and then you do you know whatever you want to get the car to the top of the deck go whichever way you may may want to get the card so I personally like flipping through it and you know making a few cuts when I see their card and I get it in my hand I just cut it to the top so it's right there and when I cut it I just put it on the top of the deck now do a couple more and then when I put it down and say what was your card and they go who is the six of diamonds there's their card and literally you know what the card was before you gave him the deck okay for my next trick and by far this is my favorite trick of them all and if it works it really knocks the socks off people so for this trick you're going to need to make a pyramid of fives so you have 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 s & 5 fives and what you're going to do is ask your friend who you know when we're doing this completely concentrate it's gonna sound funny we're gonna need you to say the fives outlaw out loud the row but in the middle of everything I'm gonna stop ask you a question and you need to give me the very first answer related to the question that pops in your head and like I said if this works it works and it makes them go crazy so so what you're gonna do we can actually try this at home or you could try this at home I'm gonna point to a row and then you are going to say the row out loud and then I'm gonna start from the top and go straight down and then I'm gonna randomly pick and like I said in the middle of it I'm gonna ask you a question and you're going to answer the question so again you need to really concentrate on this for this to work so let's start at the top yeah 555 555-5555 and 55555 five thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five five five hundred and fifty five fifty five thousand 555-5555 five five hundred fifty five fifty five five thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five 555 555 thousand 555 555-5555 thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five five what's the first vegetable that comes to your so then I'm gonna hold this up and say now if that worked on you whoo and then if they say another word which is another vegetable that has that color which would be tomato it works really good it's a great trick I'm going to tell you how this works and how I said how I you know set it up you're gonna actually have the fives and you are really going to randomly pick fives so from what I have been told the number 5 is related to the color orange in your head so when you're just thinking about 5s 555 555 and the rows of 5 and then you ask them a question what's the first vegetable that comes to their mind pretty much 70% of the time they say carrot or tomato so carrot being the number one answer tomato being the number two answer so what I usually do is put carrot I have it written on a piece of paper have it in my right pocket and I have tomato written on a piece of paper in my left pocket and if they say a carrot and you pull it out it just totally blows their mind if they say tomato same thing it totally blows their mind now like I said it works 70 percent of the time but when it works it's amazing so give it a shot on your friends but remember they need complete concentration all right for this this next trick you're going to need a a pen in a piece of paper so I only need one so what you're gonna do is ask your friend and this could be a this is a very good group trick if you have more than one person two three four people it works but since I'm here by myself we're going to use a deck of cards here to randomly pick a four-digit number so we have a deck of cards and we're just gonna flip through and say okay to can't use jank I see one two four six clean seven so two four six seven is our number two four six seven now being the magician than I am I'm going to write the answer down right now before the trick is over I'm going to write down  right that's the answer hold this over  I'm gonna leave it right where everybody can see right okay so now for the second part of the trick to continue we already have the answer written down you're gonna ask another person for a four digit number so let's pick some cards  Jack we got eight ten five so we're gonna use the ten in that one I should have used those as ten so we have a eight one zero five and let's pick a few more numbers three nine eight so three nine eight four all right three nine eight four so those are all the random numbers that that we've picked or your your friends have given you I'm just again using a deck of cards to to make this work so now I am going to use my exquisite math math my exquisite magical skills to to make this work so I'm going to pick a four digit number myself I'm going to pick one eight nine four and the next number I'm going to pick is six zero one five and now let's add these up and hopefully when I add all of these these five digits up they're going to total the magical answer so let's try this so we've got 10 18 25 we got 1026 we've got 1024  we've got 1022 so the answer I came up with is 2222 462 let's see if the magical answer  see if you can see that one two two four six two so I'm gonna show you how to do this trick now actually I have a Freudian slip before it is mathematics it is a mathematic trip so let me show you how to do it now you're going to ask your your friend for a four-digit number and if it's a group you could ask someone for two digits and another two person for two digits the only rule is the four digit number they give you can't end in 1 or 0 it cannot end in 1 or 0 so I'm going to use 6 5 4 3 as a number so there's your starting number and now you're going to write the answer down to get the answer what you're going to do is you're going to subtract 2 from the final number and put that 2 in the front so the magic answer for this one would be 2 6 5 4 1 so again 2 6 5 4 1 will be the answer I'm gonna write that down on another piece of paper 2 6 5 4 1 so that is going to be the answer to this trick now you're gonna ask them for another four digit number and then you know first you're gonna wrap that up and say okay I have the magical answer if you can put it in someone's pocket you can put it on the you know on the bar under a glass so there you go and then you're going to ask for another four digit number so they can give you it at this point time you could use any numbers you want so one six seven two and another number could be five three one four so now for this next part what you're going to do is each one of these numbers individually you're going to make equal nine in your four numbers so for the first number I'm looking at as this one so my number is going to be eight the next number is six so my number is going to be three seven my number will be two and two my number will be seven so let me just show you how that looks 8/3 - seven okay so and now I'm going to make this next line the next four digits one two three four those I'm going to individually make equal nine so five is going to be 4 3 is going to be six one will be eight four will be five so let me write that down to show you so we've got four six eight five and just to show you arrows these are the numbers then I'm making equal 9 the reason I do it this way is so they can't see the way I'm making it equal 9 if you do all their numbers in a row so you're making this number equal 9 7 2 and then this number you're gonna make 5 plus 1 equals 9 4 3 plus what equals 9 6 etc etc now if we add this all up it should equal our magic number so so we've got 10 21 you've got 10 24  we've got let's see 6:12 21 22 23 24 25 this last one we have that city can 25:26 so that's the magical answer - six five four one and surprisingly - six five four one magic or mathematics well thanks for watching we appreciate it remember if you like this video please click on the link below and at the end of

what's up guys welcome to Terry versus Bryan challenge number two now if you remember I kind of got worked in the first challenge and okay she just won but it resulted in some horrible chest waxing punishment that was not great but I'm coming back for my revenge so what we have today is we've got a five-part challenge so we're going to take it one event at a time first event is right here is a circus dumbbell for reps so we're gonna go one minute for reps Kerri has a 60 pound dumbbell and I'm gonna go with a 180 so mine is three times as heavy that's how we're kind of get a role with these challenges is to kind of equal out the weight so we can both do them and then the fun part is whoever loses gets a punishment yeah so I'm sticking with my original punishment because I still want one I haven't won and I want Kerri to get in the cold tub so that is you doing hot and Krystal has never happened yeah it hasn't happened but today it's going down so you got to get ready for that so that's your punishment and what is my punishment if I lose which I'm not going to if you lose we're gonna just do like a little face grooming eyebrow waxing maybe like a nice shave okay nose waxing I like I think they can do the inside of your nose the inside of my nose I think so I've heard it doesn't really hurt that bad I've never had a dog that sounds horrible it's how that sounds but it will be so clean after no all right so that you just heard what's not gonna happen so that's great I told that you have an advantage today so we'll see I'm gonna give him my all okay cuz I would love to see you get your nose wax all right and I'm sure they would love to get here well without without further ado let's get into challenge number one this dumbbell and what does see how this goes  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause] I'm almost sure that was 11 I think you oh my gosh whoo coming out of the gate you remove it I was hoping I could get ahead and then I was going right and left and I saw how fast you were going so I decided to drop the left and go with the right oh my god I know you'll always go right left right left yeah so so terrified then my right was gonna give out so I kept going back and forth the whole time yes I did find them I started that way oh my gosh prob about halfway through tens better than I thought I would do so I was a lot closer a lot closer than I wanted to be but I will take the I'll take the win one down one to go all right part two of the challenge is something a little bit more in my wheelhouse we are going to do Burpee box jumps max in one minute so what what are the rules Burpee box jumps and this is for Carrie for sure dumbbell now Burpee boxes all right rules are basically surreal simple chest and thighs on the ground okay stand up however you want jump up on the box and bring your hips through that's one rep and we're just going to do as many reps as we can in one minute so as you guys can see Carrie's box is a little bit higher than my box so this is my handicap for this challenge although I'm excited to test my conditioning I've been working hard on this conditioning so I have not been doing burpees but we will see we'll see for a minute for a minute I feel like I can I can try to keep up cheat if we went past a minute this would be no challenge at all but I'm gonna give you a run for your money yeah good game let's do it  up Oh  Oh  oh come on  ah  ah  oh I think I got 11 I think I don't know that was horrible I think I was loving qml was I think you've jumped on the box if I did the same number which I don't know if I did what did you video review but I think you got on the Box first do you think we did female rat stuff Dibley oh man I might as well be a loser well that's not very nice thanks we'll do a photo replay but I believe in 11 I was starting 12 I was on the ground for 12 I was on the ground too but I kept as on I knew I was a little bit behind ladies what call we'll call that a win for you all right time conditioning gets better though you got to give me that much better much better I see the veins copy what yeah those forearms are huge calm down with the compliments too much man all right guys three yeah  third event of the competition is going to be the tank push now this is something we have never actually done against each other but we we walk by and said you know what we should do some type of split you know fast challenge to just kind of test for you so the way that the tank actually works is there's a resistance that you can select so the weight on top doesn't actually matter it's actually the gearing of the tank so what we're gonna do is this is just a guess as well Terry's gonna go on level number one which is not a lot of resistance and I'm gonna go on level three which is the max resistance that you can do and hopefully that will kind of make it even basically what we got is we've got a course with two cones set out we've got to push this all the way down break the far cone run around to the other side and then push it back and then as soon as the front breaks this this cone then we're done so we're just going to time each other we're going to keep it honest with if you could even fair and see who can go faster  oh my gosh there's 1779 Oh God so my cause going so slow you totally know you were moving a little bit more a little bit more forcing leverage okay that was awesome here you go 1779 yeah kind of felt don't slow I think it was slower coming back I think you got there in maybe seven seconds oh really you're moving the I was nervous Suze you got down there all right so so that's two wins two for you two to one two events remaining yeah okay this is this is getting interesting oh good all right ready for the next challenge let's do it let's do it all right guys next is challenge number four and advantage is gonna be with Brian this time again I don't know if this is an advantage or not so what we've got is we're gonna do some loading so we both got a platform I have a road 250 pound sandbag and for cannery we've got this weighted ball that's uh that's 80 pounds here so obviously they're not both sandbags and carry is quite a bit shorter than me so I have a little bit of an advantage with the platform height all those sandbags a little bit harder to grab off the floor so are you doing like I do I do but I figured had to head this way we can look at each other and see who is winning and who's losing yeah I got to come back and tie it up the pressure is definitely on your shoulders because if I win this it's over I know I have Wow and you're getting in a cold tub I'm gonna fight with everything okay okay I feel like you're uh Tereus not just competitive ultra-competitive so there is no way she's going down without a fight so I'm a little nervous with this and I'm gonna need to bring my a-game to try to keep up with her here  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] Oh  [Music]  I'm gonna we have no idea let me do up I don't know what I really think I'm the head of you though oh yeah I think I'll whip yours is on top of money mines on the floor so I think you there's nothing else at except for the one up oh my gosh know how much fun how was up that's fine oh oh oh yeah yeah that's not literally I'm gonna keep that in my mind that's not happening I'm gonna keep cuz you're gonna be freezing no that's awesome just keep it keep it in there not happy good just get ready for it alright here we go refreshing here we go so it comes down to this literally we're tied two to two which means it's even and this challenge is kettlebell swings so what we have to do is race to 50 whoever whoever can get the fifty first the rules are basically you have to take it between your legs and it has to come up to face level is is a rep so basically that would be one rep and then you have to go 50 now the question is is whether or not we can do this unbroken or if we're gonna have to take a break or from a strategy standpoint if it'll be better to take a break in a certain number and I don't know when's the last time you did higher up kettlebell swings to be completely honest with you I don't really remember the last time I did kettlebell swings in general okay um I I'm nervous about this one not necessarily like the credible swing movement yeah but as you said Dwayne fifty it's for me it's going to be more of a mental being how deep can I go into that spot to go 250 or do I take a break and if I take a break how fast can I get back to the kettlebell yeah um well and to be do you have a strategy I I don't I mean I've I've done kettlebells for conditioning so you know I basically have done that done them four sets of 10 as part of kind of like a circuit which you guys have kind of seen with some of my training videos but not for high reps without taking a break so Terry's got 35 pounds I've got a hundred and six pounds so I think this is this is obviously a winner-take-all but if I had to call it I don't know and I think that's kind of why we picked that when we were when we were picking out these events and kind of agreeing to the challenge we wanted to pick something as a finisher if it was tied it would come down to this and um and we wouldn't know who would have the advantage obviously so what let's go first one to 51 sound good [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  No that is horrible [Music]  no way of knowing you know that yeah I know Pepe he may be all sound sound like no I don't have to speak no idea where you were oh my gosh how was impressive up that so much most you've ever done yeah never I've never got fifty in a row like that it's tough for me cuz my fingers I feel good but I kind of forgot about that when I was going in and I went to grab it knows pinkies wouldn't pitch so I pulled them out oh the first one you could swing right away and I had to kind of do like a loading to swing it and I was scared right from the start I was trying as much as I can to push the paper literally one rep one rep away it was close close the whole time generally close yeah was a good it was a good challenge yeah is it go challenge and now you're gonna look even more hero my gosh then you do already that is gonna be horrible I heard it's not that bad it's okay I've heard I'm sure your friend is going to be excited to see me again and it'll be wonderful we can throw in watching your chest again no no no no no that was not we're not adding that on to this the face waxing and noses it nothing I don't want to think about that I'm getting done with this one rep I don't know it was so close we couldn't have planned that better that wasn't true that was a true challenge I wanted a second there I wanted to say I was done so badly a newbie well I appreciate you being honest yeah it was definitely definitely the right channel oh my gosh well good job so much for victory this time around it was close it was close well that was fun it was super close the whole time you guys I have to say I'm very impressed with your condition it's better it's much better - better I'm very impressed good job yeah I mean I'm gonna come back and be you and something that's uh well do I do don't you did great so job anyways I think I think we're gonna wrap it up there hopefully you guys enjoy Terry versus Bryan number two and unfortunately the second round goes to carry as well congratulations but yeah what can I say my wife is awesome so it's tough fun tough to compete against her especially these challenges but I love having a wife that's competitive and it'll do this stuff with me and it makes life a lot of fun so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the video for now go out and be great and we'll check you guys later [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]", "wJB90G-tsgo": "So how many of you How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family? So how many of you How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family? Maybe there was some split How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family? Maybe there was some split mentalities around money How many of you know what I'm talking about? You know like maybe mom had a certain way of thinking and dad had a certain way of thinking So how many of you guys know who my dad is? My mom and dad got married when they were like 22 years old, my dad flunked out of college Right as a speech and communication major which is pretty awesome considering he's like one of the greatest motivational and real estate training speakers ever right and His mindset because his mentor this is what his mentor said to him you want to make a lot of money go buy a rolls-royce Go get a big fancy watch and go get a really expensive car and a real expensive house And you will be motivated like crazy And you will go do whatever it takes to be successful and guess what my dad did He went up a big fancy car big watch. You know rolls-royce the whole nine yards and every day He was like this. Holy shit. I gotta make money My mom on the other hand Grew up in an environment with a few more kids my grandfather. My mom's mom passed away when she was very young and she Immediately had to go to work at like 14 years old by the time. She was 16 She was working at Disneyland as a Mouseketeer You know Orange County, California, and she's doing great But all of her money went back into the family So she would work only to basically have no for herself benefit from it so in her mind Every cookie in the cookie jar mattered you should be very mindful with every single dollar Imagine growing up in that house This one is like it's not how much money You just need to make sure there's at least one cookie in the cookie jar we could divide it up six ways and my dad's like we should start a cookie factory and finance the entire thing Well, no surprise that relationship did not last long right my dad actually ended up marrying somebody who was ridiculously financially savvy And I think she's somewhere inside the room who are you inside the realm? My my other mom somewhere inside her maybe you're running around the room The bottom line was this I grew up with a completely messed up psychology when it came to money And it wasn't until in my mid-20s when I met one of my mentors who he showed me something which I'm gonna Show you, the bottom line is this guy's money is a tool nothing more nothing less say that out loud Money is a tool nothing more nothing less, listen if you're a jerk money makes you more of a jerk if You are mother Teresa money makes you more mother Teresa It is just a tool, but this is what I know how many of you know someone that doesn't have enough money, I Don't know about you guys. I don't want to be that person and Not that I feel bad for them or less them all I think to myself is That person was never taught what I'm about to teach you They never understood that your money is a tool and just like an app on a phone if you don't use it and play the game right and follow the steps. You don't get the results. It's not how much money you earn It is what you do with the money that matters, you guys with me on this So I want you to write in your notes the following There's been a lot of research on this and you've probably seen something like this before Especially if you've ever met with a financial planner, or you know you've watched CNN financial. They all say the same thing write down 5, 15 and 80. 5 percent 15 percent and 80 percent Five percent 15 percent and 80 percent and as all the studies show it Says five percent of the planet are basically generational wealth They have created generational wealth It's not the top one percent guys somebody who is worth five million dollars Who has paid off their home and when they pass on they Transfer all that wealth over. That's generational wealth you with me on this Some of them are worth millions some of them ten some of them are hundreds some of them are now billions But that's the 5% the 15% write this in your notes. You ready. They are the middle class They got a house They got a little savings. They go on a few vacations, and they're comfortable and there's nothing wrong with that 15% But where do you think the 80% sets? Darcy the 80% 80% 80% look around the room potentially 80 percent of this room I don't think so, but potentially with the numbers 80 percent of this room when they are older either A have to work to make money or B are dependent upon the government or their family to subsidize their lifestyle 80% 80% 80% some of your think to yourself my kids better be successful 5% generational wealth and it starts at five million dollars and above fifteen percent comfortable my in-laws are 93 and 90 years old they have a million dollar net worth there in that 15 percent, house is paid for that they bought for $11 300 years ago right in Anaheim, California on Bruce Street Paid that sucker off Every time I talked to my father law you see my Ford stock Right he's not he started buying Ford stock like in 1948 You with me like I had a dollar that I had two shares then three shares, but over time guess what he's in that 15% How many of you know someone right now though? That based upon their money behaviors, and their money psychology They're clearly going to end up in the 80% Don't point out him if they're in this room and don't like you know make them wrong, but I'd like you to consider Maybe they just never heard what I'm about to share with you So I'm gonna show you guys a business strategy for your money you guys have for that a business strategy I'm not gonna tell you what to invest in that's not my role I'm going to show you ideas of what the very best people do, I'm gonna put it up on the big screen Which means the team's gonna keep it here the whole time? And you're gonna take detailed copious notes, so here's the first thing. I want to show you This is what 80% of real estate professionals do 80% of real estate professionals They get a commission check and that check goes into their personal account their personal account 80% they get a check and it goes into their personal account they go home And maybe they say here honey, or here on by myself, and I put it in my account But this personal account is not an LLC an S. Corp a limited light You know limited partnership. It's not a corporation. It's a personal thing now. I'm not gonna Ask you to raise your hands if that's you But I am gonna say this to you I would like to thank you for paying lots in taxes Thank you very much. I really appreciate you overpaying what you should be paying keep up the good work So what's rule number one? Should I have a corporation yes, or yes? Yes, or yes? so check this out guys if you answered this, don't feel bad I will teach this stuff at conferences And I'm blown away by ten people in the room 10,000 people in the room the number of people that go Yeah, I thought about doing that but like I don't know like which one do I pick I'm no expert Here's what you do you call your Accountant and say I think I need to get incorporated, which you recommend based on where I live What country what state etc? But rule number one is no one leaves this conference in 30 days if you are not incorporated And you don't own your business and now your checks come to blankety-blank LLC not you personally Cuz now you get all the tax advantages yes or no guys But I got to tell you, this is what the 80% does and this is clearly bad. Let me show you What the 15% do. I Want you to draw this out I Want you to imagine a world, where and by the way? Did you guys notice the subtle little difference? This one says check this one says checks Because people that get checks Understand the following, I get the check it goes directly into my business account Right I get it wired in from escrow. I don't get physical checks anymore the money Just gets transferred over, you with me Oh my a escrow company my title coming up won't do it great get the physical check But it goes into a business account, which means now as you can see I'm gonna have four different Accounts at my bank Four different accounts at my bank. I'm get out my business account I'm gonna have my tax account to me three accounts Tax account business account and my home account my personal account Here's the reality my friends if I if I can encourage and inspire You know every single one of you to just do that and then Follow the rule you ready write this in your notes above the tax account I want you to write down let's let's do an imaginary check and I want you to show you how much money goes where so at the top, let's say, that's a $10,000 check, just for easy numbers $10,000 check so all of a sudden $10,000 hits my business account and the first thing that happens is instantaneously 3,300 of the 10,000 goes directly into my tax account 3300 automatically into my tax account because some of you think when you get a check for 10 grand that you actually have 10 grand How many of you are in the state of California or New York or in the country of Canada You get a check for 10 grand, and you're lucky if you get 4,500 That's the real deal now you're an entrepreneur you own your own business you're gonna start taking better write-offs You're gonna pay more attention to your accountant You're probably gonna have your uncle Larry who's done your taxes forever stop and actually hire a CPA who's gonna pay attention? But 3,300 bucks automatically goes there then 3,300 or less goes into your business account and This is where I run my business a check comes in I've got marketing a check comes in I've got expenses a check comes in I've got my MLS dues Everything that I need to run my business every check 3,300 3,300, and then what goes over here 3,400 bucks to my home Now it sounds like you might need a home budget. What do you guys think? Because many times what do we do we get a check and we just start spending the money? By the way if you look at this the very first one. This is the the cardinal sin this is what poor people do they get a check and They just start spending Who knows someone like that say I? matter of fact the bigger the check the more they start spending and they never think about Debt reduction because they'll do that later Because I've worked so hard and this was such a challenging transaction And that's why I'm going to overindulge and over and spend on myself, and we know the financial rollercoaster. You're actually putting yourself through this my friends is What the people do that take care of their money they know Uncle Sam or Revenue, Canada or Mexico? They're taking their money. No matter what so when I commit that Check comes in I don't say to myself I get it all it automatically goes there I leave a piece here, and the balance goes here makes sense so tell your buddy. Are you gonna do this yes or no? Yes or no Now here's what I know look up here guys The number of clients that have done this and then I see them a year later And they go I have $15,000 and my savings kind of never had that but more importantly I paid all my taxes Like I'm on time and I have money inside my business account and it's the end of the year and my accountant said I need to take a Dividend so I'm getting a big chunk of change at the end of the year. This is awesome Now I don't know about you guys, but I like is anybody like nice things You know family trips vacations memories, holidays, you know maybe a new outfit The challenge is if you keep that psychology without requiring or putting in the discipline You know what you end up with a bunch of nice things and a shit ton of debt So do me a favor tell your buddy. Do you know someone personally that has too much debt? Anybody's anybody inside this room Now listen there's smart Debt. There's bad, debt, and I'm not gonna go too in depth with you on this But you know the difference you know credit card, debt at nineteen percent is dumb Debt buying a house and getting a mortgage with three-and-a-half percent is really good debt So we all know the difference, and I just want you to be mindful I want you to take care of your money, but now did you guys get a photo of this? Did you capture it are you sure? Are you promising to do this? Okay, do you want to know what the wealthy agents do? This is what the wealthy agents. Do it's a little more complex It's a little more complex I would get it up on the big screen over there guys and take a photo of it, but more importantly I want you to draw the whole thing out in your notes Draw the whole thing out on your notes, this is what the wealthy do This is the stuff that no one taught me so all until Bill Mitchell Pulled me aside and said what do you do with your money? and I'm like I don't know I just get the check and I throw it inside my account and I spend it like crazy and I never have any cash, and I'm always in trouble Draw this out So play a game with me you get a $10,000 check The $10,000 check goes to what account? to what account and 33% of it goes automatically where To my tax account because I don't really have 10,000. I really have like you know 6,000 and change that's the real deal so 3300 automatically here then I take another 3300 over here or less because I don't know your business expenses But by the way guys here Marketing costs should be no more than 10% of your expected gross revenue Your marketing cost should be no more than 10% of your expected gross revenue So a percentage that 3300 is gonna go for your direct mail and your Marketing and your email and your Zillow leads and your Facebook ads and the prints and the brochures and everything else But no more than 10% No more than 10% got it? Because you're incorporated now your car and a piece of your house and all kinds of other things get written off into or from this account so we like that but you might also have inside there ready guys a Virtual assistant an assistant well, where is that person gonna be paid from you got a check for 10 grand You didn't actually get 10 grand you got 6730 3300 goes inside here now I can pay my assistant it starts to work like clockwork you with me, but you can see This is where it gets interesting Some people call this other account your investment account. I like to think of it as my financial hub It's where the money comes in and then it gets divided again Now I'm not a financial planner nor do.

message you are about to hear was written and recorded on a record in 1956 by Earl Nightingale this message is the answer to the question that he had been searching for from the time he was about nine years old Earl Nightingale had been born and economically depressed times as a child because they were so poor Earl desperately wanted to know why some people grew up to enjoy prosperity while others like his family struggled merely to survive unable to find answers to his questions from grownups girl began reading everything he could believing that someone somewhere had the answer many years passed and when Earl was 35 years old he wrote and recorded this message it was to be played one Saturday morning to a small group of salesmen during his absence when Earl returned he learned that the message had made such a positive impact on the men they wanted copies to share with their friends and family Earl arranged with Columbia Records to duplicate the record to meet the many requests much to Earl's surprise in very little time without any real advertising or marketing over a million copies have been sold and he received a gold record Earl called the message the strangest secret and this single recording was the seedling from which the entire personal development industry grew and because Earl had discovered the true meaning of the strangest secret which determines the outcome of one's life he went from poverty to become one of the most highly recognized voices and names throughout the United States and from the West Indies to South Africa his daily radio program our changing world was the world's most widely sponsored radio program and was her daily across the United States Canada Mexico Australia the Bahamas Guam New Zealand Puerto Rico the Armed Forces radio and 30 countries overseas i'm diana nightingale and since my husband's death in 1989 i have continually looked for new effective ways to continue to share Earle's many messages of inspiration with the world the personal development industry is so vast today and yet people around the world attribute the strangest secret as being the one message that has most positively affected their lives brill revised the strangest secret several times over the past 40 years as times changed because of these changes I believe you will appreciate the historic value of this original recording as you listen you will notice how the statistics reflect those of the mid-1950s you'll also hear Earl mention the other side of the record but 40 years later the message is as true and valuable as it was then now I invite you to sit back relax and enjoy the original the strangest secret by Earl Nightingale  I'd like to tell you about the strangest secret in the world not long ago Albert Schweitzer the great doctor and Nobel Prize winner was being interviewed in London and a reporter asked him doctor what's wrong with men today the great doctor was silent a moment and then he said men simply don't think and it's about this that I want to talk with you we live today in a golden age this is an era that man has looked forward dreamed of and worked toward for thousands of years but since it's here we pretty well take it for granted we in America are particularly fortunate to live in the richest land that ever existed on the face of the earth a land of abundant opportunity for everyone but do you know what happens let's take a hundred men who start even at the age of 25 do you have any idea what will happen to those men by the time they're 65 these 100 men who all start even at the age of 25 believe they're going to be successful if you ask any one of these men if he wanted to be a success he'd tell you that he did and you'd notice that he was eager toward life that there was a certain sparkle to his eye and erectus to his carriage and life seemed like a pretty interesting adventure to him but by the time they're 65 one will be rich four will be financially independent five will still be working fifty four will be broke now think a moment out of the 100 only five make the grade why do so many fail what has happened to these Sparkle that was there when they were 25 what's become of the dreams the hopes the plans and why is there such a large disparity between what these men intended to do and what they actually accomplished when we say about five percent achieve success we have to define success and here's the definition success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal if a man is working toward a predetermined goal and knows where he's going that man is a success if he's not doing that he's a failure success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal Rallo may the distinguished psychiatrist wrote a wonderful book called and search for himself and in this book he says the opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice it is conformity and there you have the trouble today its conformity people acting like everyone else without knowing why without knowing where they're going now think of it in America right now there are over 14 million people 65 years of age and over and about 13 million of these 14 million are broke they're dependent on someone else for life's necessities now we learn to read by the time we're 7 we learn to make a living by the time we're 25 usually by that time we're not only making a living we're supporting a family and yet by the time we're 65 we haven't learned how to become financially independent in the richest land that has ever been known why we can form and the trouble is that we're acting like the wrong percentage group the ninety five percent who don't succeed now why do these people conform well they don't know really these people believe that their lives are shaped by circumstances by things that happen to them by exterior forces their outer directed people a survey was made one time that covered a lot of men working man and these men were asked this question why do you work why do you get up in the morning 19 out of 20 had no idea if you ask them they'll say everyone goes to work in the morning and that's the reason they do it because everyone else is doing it now let's get back to our definition of success who succeeds the only man who succeeds is the man who is progressively realizing a worthy ideal he's the man who says I'm going to become this and then begins to work toward that goal I'll tell you who the successful people are as success is the school teacher who's teaching school because that's what she wanted to do the success is the woman who's a wife and mother because she wanted to become a wife and mother and is doing a good job of it the success is the man who runs the corner gas station because that's what he wanted to do the success is the successful salesman who wants to become a top-notch salesman and grow and build with his organization a success is anyone who is doing deliberately a predetermined job because that's what he decided to do deliberately but only one out of 20 does that that's why today there isn't really any competition unless we make it for ourselves instead of competing all we have to do is create now for 20 years I looked for the key which would determine what would happen to a human being was there a key I wanted to know which would make the future of promise that we could foretell to a large extent was there a key that would guarantee a person's becoming successful if he only knew about it and knew how to use it well there is such a key and I've found it have you ever wondered why so many men worked so hard and honestly without ever achieving anything in particular and others don't seem to work hard and yet seem to get everything they have the magic touch you've heard them say that about someone everything he touches turns to gold and have you ever noticed that a man who becomes successful tends to continue to become successful and on the other hand have you noticed how a man who is a failure tends to continue to fail it's because of goals some of us have them some don't people with goals succeed because they know where they're going now think of a ship leaving a harbor and think of it with the complete voyage mapped out and planned the captain and crew know exactly where it's going and how long it will take it has a definite goal 9999 times out of 10,000 it will get to where it started out to get now let's take another ship just like the first only let's not put a crew on it or a captain at the helm let's give it no aiming point no goal no destination we just start the engines and let it go I think you'll agree with me that if it gets out of the harbor at all it will either sink or wind up on some deserted beach a derelict it can't go anyplace because it has no destination and no guidance it's the same with a human being take the salesman for example there is no other person in the world today with the future of a good salesman selling is the world's highest-paid profession if we're good at it and if we know where we're going every company needs top-notch salesmen and they reward those men the sky is the limit for them but how many can you find someone once said the human race is fixed not to prevent the strong from winning but to prevent a weak from Lou the American economy today can be likened to a convoy in time of war the entire economy is slowed down to protect its weakest link just as the convoy had to go at the speed that would permit its slowest vessel to remain in formation that's why it's so easy to make a living today it takes no particular brains or talent to make a living and support a family today so we have a plateau of so-called security if that's what a person is looking for but we do have to decide how high above this plateau we want to aim for now let's get back to the strangest secret in the world the story that I wanted to tell you today why do men with goals succeed in life and men without them fail well let me tell you something which if you really understand it will alter your life immediately if you understand completely what I'm going to tell you from this moment on your life will never be the same again you'll suddenly find that good luck just seems to be attracted to you the things you want just seem to fall in line and from now on you won't have the problems the worries the knowing lump of anxiety that perhaps you've experienced before doubt fear well they'll be things of the past here's the key to success and the key to failure we become what we think about now let me say that again we become what we think about throughout all history the great wise men and teachers philosophers and prophets have disagreed with one another on many different things it is only on this one point that they are incomplete and unanimous agreement listen to what Marcus Aurelius the great Roman Emperor said he said a man's life is what his thoughts make of it Disraeli said this everything comes if a man will only wait I have brought myself by long meditation to the conviction of a human being with a settled purpose must accomplish it and that nothing can resist a will that will stake even existence for its fulfillment Ralph Waldo Emerson said this a man is what he thinks about all day long William James said the greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their by altering their attitudes of mind and he also said we need only in cold blood act as if the thing in question were real and it will become infallibly real by growing into such a connection with our life that it will become real it will become so knit with habit and emotion that our interest in it will be those which characterized belief he also said this if you only care enough for a result you will almost certainly attain it if you wish to be rich you will be rich if you wish to be learned you will be learning if you wish to be good you will be good only you must then really wish these things and wish them exclusively and not wish at the same time a hundred other incompatible things just as strongly in the Bible you read in mark 9:23 if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth dr. norman vincent peale said this this is one of the greatest laws in the universe fervently do i wish i had discovered it as a very young man it dawned upon me much later in life and i found it to be one of the greatest if not my greatest discovery outside of my relationship to God and the great law briefly and simply stated is that if you think in negative terms you'll get negative results if you think in positive terms you will achieve positive results that is the simple fact which is at the basis of an astonishing law of prosperity and success in three words believe and succeed William Shakespeare put it this way our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt George Bernard Shaw said people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are I don't believe in circumstances the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can't find them make them well it's pretty apparent isn't it and every person who discovered this for a while believed that he was the first one to work it out we become we think about now it stands to reason that a person who's thinking about a concrete and worthwhile gold is going to reach it because that's what he's thinking about and we become what we think about conversely the man who has no goal who doesn't know where he's going and whose thoughts must therefore be thoughts of confusion and anxiety and fear and worry becomes what he thinks about his life becomes one of frustration fear anxiety and worry and if he thinks about nothing he becomes nothing now how does it work why do we become what we think about well I'll tell you how it works as far as we know now to do this I want to tell you about a situation that parallels the human mind suppose a farmer has some land and it's good fertile land now the land gives the farmer a choice he may plant in that land whatever he chooses the land doesn't care it's up to the farmer to make the decision now remember we're comparing the human mind with the land because of the mind like the lamb doesn't care what you plant in it it will return what you planned but it doesn't care what you plant now let's say that the farmer has two seeds in his hand one is a seed of corn the other is nightshade a deadly poison he digs two little holes in the earth and he plants both seeds one corn the other nightshade he covers up the holes waters and takes care of the land and what will happen invariably the land will return what is planted as it's written in the Bible as you sow so shall you reap remember the land doesn't care it will return poison and just as wonderful abundance as it will corn so up come the two plants one corn one poison now the human mind is far more fertile far more incredible and mysterious than the land but it works the same way it doesn't care what we plant success/failure a concrete worthwhile goal or confusion misunderstanding fear anxiety and so on but what we plant it will return to us you see the human mind is the last great unexplored continent on the earth it contains riches beyond our wildest dreams it will return anything we want to plant now you might say but if that's true why don't people use their minds more well I think they've figured out an answer to that to our mind comes a standard equipment at birth it's free and things that are given to us for nothing we place little value on things that we pay money for we value the paradox is that exactly the reverse is true everything that's really worthwhile in life came to us free our mind our soul our body our hopes our dreams our ambitions our intelligence our love of family and children and friends all these priceless possessions are free but the things that cost us money are actually very cheap and can be replaced at any time a good man can be completely wiped out and make another fortune he can do that several times even if our home burns down we can rebuild it but the things we got for nothing we can never replace the human mind isn't used merely because we take it for granted familiarity breeds contempt it can do any kind of job we assign to it but generally speaking we use it for little jobs instead of big important ones universities have proved that most of us are operating on about 10 percent of our abilities decide now what is it you want plant your goal in your mind it's the most important decision you ever make in your entire life do you want to be an outstanding salesman a better worker at your particular job do you want to go places in your company in your community all you've got to do is plant that seed in your mind care for it work steadily toward your goal and it will become a reality it not only will there's no way that it cannot you see that is a law like the laws of Sir Isaac Newton the laws of gravity if you get on top of a building and jump off you'll always go down you'll never go up and it's the same with all the other laws of nature they always work they're inflexible think about your goal in a relaxed positive way picture yourself in your mind's eye as having already achieved this goal see yourself doing the things you will be doing when you've reached your goal ours has been called the phenobarbital age the age of ulcers and nervous breakdowns at a time when medical research has raised us to a new plateau of good health and longevity far too many of us worry ourselves into an early grave trying to cope with things in our own little personal ways without learning a few great laws that will take care of everything for us these things we bring on ourselves through our habitual way of thinking every one of us is the sum total of his own thoughts he is where he is because that exactly where he really wants to be whether he'll admit that or not each of us must live off the fruit of his thoughts in the future because what you think today and tomorrow next month the next year will mold your life and determine your future you're guided by your mind I remember one time I was driving through Arizona and I saw one of those giant earthmoving machines roaring along the road at about 35 miles an hour with what looked like 20 tons of dirt in it a tremendous incredible machine and there was a little man perched way up on top with the wheel in his hands guiding it and as I drove along I was struck by the similarity of that machine to the human mind just suppose you're sitting at the controls of such a vast source of energy are you going to sit back and fold your arms and let it run itself into a ditch or are you going to keep both hands firmly on the wheel and control and direct this power to a specific worthwhile purpose it's up to you you're in the driver's seat you see the very law that gives us success is a two-edged sword we must control our thinking the same rule that can lead a man to a life of success wealth happiness and all the things he's ever dreamed of for himself and his family that very same law can lead him into the gutter it's all in how he uses it for good or for bad this is the strangest secret in the world now why do I say it's strange and why do I call it a secret actually it isn't a secret at all it was first promulgated by some of the earliest wise man and it appears again and again throughout the Bible but very few people have learned it understand it that's why it's strange and why for some equally strange reason it virtually remains a secret I believe that you could go out and walk down the Main Street of your town and ask one man after another what the secret of success is you probably wouldn't one into one man in a month who could tell you now this information is enormous ly valuable to us if we really understand it and apply it it's valuable to us not only for our own lives but the lives of those around us our family employees associates and friends life should be an exciting adventure it should never be a bore a man should live fully be alive he should be glad to get out of bed in the morning he should be doing a job he likes to do because he does it well one time I heard Grove Patterson make a speech the editor-in-chief of the Toledo daily Blade and as he concluded his speech he said something that I've never forgotten he said something like this my years in the newspaper business have convinced me of several things among them that people are basically good and that we came from someplace and were going someplace so we should make our time here an exciting adventure the architect of the universe didn't build a stairway leading nowhere and the greatest teacher of all the carpenter from the plains of Galilee gave us the secret time and time again as she believed so shall it be done unto you  you  on side number one of this record I've explained the strangest secret in the world and how it works now on this side I want to explain how you can prove to yourself the enormous returns possible in your own life by putting this secret to a practical test I want you to make a test that will last 30 days now it isn't going to be easy if you'll give it a good try it will completely change your life for the better back in the 17th century Sir Isaac Newton the English mathematician and natural philosopher gave us some natural laws of physics which apply as much to human beings as they do to the movement of bodies in the universe now one of these laws is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction simply stated as it applies to you and me it means we can achieve nothing without paying the price the results of your 30-day experiment will be in direct proportion to the effort you put forth to be a doctor you must pay the price of long years of difficult study to be successful in selling and remember that each of us succeeds to the extent of his ability to sell selling our families on our ideas selling education in schools selling our children on the advantages of living the good and honest life selling our associates and employees on the importance of being exceptional people too of course the profession of selling itself but to be successful in selling our way to the good life we must be willing to pay the price now what is that price well it's many things first it's understanding emotionally as well as intellectually that we literally become what we think about that we must control our thoughts if we're to control our lives it's understanding fully that as you sow so shall you reap secondly it's cutting away all the fetters from the mind and permitting it to soar as it was divinely designed to do it's the realization that your limitations are self-imposed and that the opportunities for you today are enormous beyond belief it's rising above narrow-minded pettiness and Prejudice thirdly to use all your courage to force yourself to think positively on your own problem to set a definite and clearly defined goal for yourself to let your marvelous mind think about your goal from all possible angles to let your imagination speculate freely upon many different possible solutions to refuse to believe there are any circumstances sufficiently strong to defeat you in the accomplishment of your purpose to act promptly and decisively when your course is clear and to keep constantly aware of the fact that you are at this moment standing in the middle of your own acre of diamonds as Russell Conwell used to point out fourth save at least 10% of what you earn it's also remembering that no matter what your present job it has enormous possibilities if you're willing to pay the price now let's just go over the important points in the price each of us must pay to achieve the wonderful life that can be ours it is of course worth any price one you will become what you think about to remember the word imagination let your mind soar three courage concentrate on your goal every day for save 10% of what you earn and action ideas are worthless unless we act on them now I'll try to apply in the 30-day test I want you to make now keep in mind that you have nothing to lose by making this test and everything you could possibly want to gain there are two things that may be said of everyone each of us wants something and each of us is afraid of something I want you to write on a card what it is you want more than anything else it may be more money perhaps you'd like to double your income or make a specific amount of money it may be a beautiful home it may be success at your job it may be a particular position in life it could be a more harmonious family each of us wants something right down on your card specifically what it is that you want make sure it's a single goal and clearly defined you needn't show it to anyone but carry it with you so that you can look at it several times a day think about it in a cheerful relaxed positive way each morning when you get up and immediately you have something to work for something to get out of bed for something to live for look at it every chance you get during the day and just before going to bed at night as you look at it remember that you must become what you think about and since you're thinking about your goal you realize that soon it will be yours in fact it's yours really the moment you write it down and begin to think about it look at the abundance all around you as you go about your daily business you have as much right to this abundance as any other living creature it's yours for the asking now we come to the difficult part difficult because it means the formation of what is probably a brand new habit and new habits are not easily formed once formed however it'll follow you for the rest of your life stop thinking about what it is you fear each time a fearful or negative thought comes into your consciousness replace it with a mental picture of your positive and worthwhile goal there will come times when you will feel like giving up it's easier for a human being to think negatively than positively that's why only 5% is successful you must begin now to place yourself in that group for 30 days you must take control of your mind it will think only about what you permitted to think each day for this 30 day test do more than you have to do in addition to maintaining a cheerful positive outlook give of yourself more than you've ever done before do this knowing that your returns in life must be in direct proportion to what you give the moment you decide on the goal to work toward you're immediately a successful person you're then in that rare and successful category of people who know where they're going out of every hundred people you belong to the top five don't concern yourself too much with how you're going to achieve your goal leave that completely to a Power greater than yourself all you have to do is know where you're going the answers will come to you of their own accord remember these words from the Sermon on the Mount and remember them well keep them constantly before you this month of your test ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened it's as marvelous and as simple as that in fact it's so simple that in our seemingly complicated world it's difficult for an adult to understand that all he needs is a purpose and faith for 30 days do your best if you're a Salesman go at it as you've never done before and not in hectic fashion but with the calm cheerful assurance that time well spent we'll give you the abundance in return you deserve and want if you're a homemaker devote your 30 day test to complete giving of yourself without thinking about receiving anything in return and you'll be amazed at the difference it makes in your life no matter what your job do it as you've never done it before for 30 days and if you've kept your goal before you every day you'll wonder and marvel at this new light you found Dorothea brand outstanding editor and writer discovered it for herself and tells about it in her fine book wake up and live her entire philosophy is reduced to the words act as though it were impossible to fail she made her own test with sincerity and faith and her entire life was changed one of overwhelming success now you wait your test for 30 full days don't start your test until you've made up your mind to stick with it you see by being persistent you're demonstrating faith persistence is simply another word for faith if you didn't have faith you would never persist if you should fail during your first 30 days by that I mean suddenly find yourself overwhelmed by negative thoughts you've got to start over again from that point and go 30 more days  gradually your new habit will form until you find yourself one of that wonderful minority to whom virtually nothing is impossible don't forget the card it's vitally important as you begin this new way of living on one side of the card write your goal whatever it may be on the other side write the words we've quoted from the Sermon on the Mount ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you in your spare time during your test period read books that will help you inspirational books like the Bible dorothea brands wake up and live the magic of believing by clogged Bristol think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and other books that instruct and inspire nothing great was ever accomplished without inspiration see that during these crucial first 30 days your own inspiration is kept at a peak above all don't worry worry brings fear and fear is crippling the only thing that can cause you to worry during your test is trying to do it all yourself know that all you have to do is hold your goal before you everything else will take care of itself remember also to keep calm and cheerful calm and cheerful don't let petty things annoy or get you off course now the sense making this test is difficult some may say well why should I bother well look at the alternative no one wants to be a failure no one really wants to be a mediocre individual no one wants a life constantly filled with worry fear and frustration therefore remember that you must reap that which you sow if you sow negative thoughts your life will be filled with negative things if you sow positive thoughts your life will be cheerful successful and positive now gradually you will have a tendency to forget what you've heard on this record play it often keep reminding yourself of what you must do to form this new habit gather your whole family about and listen to what's been said here at regular intervals in all most men will tell you that they want to make money without understanding the law the only people who make money work in the mint the rest of us must earn money this is what causes those who keep looking for something for nothing or a free ride to fail in life the only way to earn money is by providing people with services or products which are needed and useful we exchange our product or service for the other man's money therefore the law is that our financial return will be in direct proportion to our service success is not the result of making money making money is the result of success and success is in direct proportion to our service most people have this law backwards they believe that you're successful if you earn a lot of money the truth is that you can only earn money after you're successful it's like the story of the man who sat in front of the stove and said to it give me heat and then I'll add the wood how many men and women do you know or do you suppose there are today who take the same attitude toward life there are millions we've got to put the fuel in before we can expect heat likewise we've got to be of service first before we can expect money don't concern yourself with the money be of service build work dream create do this and you'll find there's no limit to the prosperity and abundance that will come to you prosperity is founded upon a law of mutual exchange any person who contributes to prosperity must prosper in turn himself sometimes the return will not come from those you serve but it must come to you from someplace for that is the law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction as you go daily through your 30-day test period remember that your success will always be measured by the quality and quantity of service you render and money is a yardstick for measuring this service no man can get rich himself unless he enriches others there are no exceptions to a law you can drive down any Street in America and from your car estimate the service that's being rendered by the people living on that street had you ever thought of this yardstick before it's interesting some like ministers and priests and other devoted people measure their returns in the realm of the spiritual but again their returns are equal to their service once this law is fully understood any thinking person can tell his own fortune if he wants more he must be of more service to those from whom he receives his return if he wants less he has only to reduce this service this is the price you must pay for what you want if you believe you can enrich yourself by deluding others you can only end by deluding yourself just as surely as you breathe you'll get back what you put out don't ever make the mistake of thinking you can avert this it's impossible the prisons and the streets were the lonely walk are filled with people who tried to make new laws just for themselves we may avoid the laws of man but there are greater laws that cannot be broken an outstanding medical doctor recently pointed out six steps that will help you realize success 1 set yourself a definite goal to quit running yourself down 3 stop thinking of all the reasons why you cannot be successful and instead think of all the reasons why you can for trace your attitudes back through your childhood and try to discover where you first got the idea you couldn't be a success if that's the way you've been thinking 5 change the image you have of yourself by writing out a description of the person you would like to be and 6 act the part of the successful person you have decided to become the doctor who wrote those words is a noted West Coast psychiatrist David Herold Fink MD do what all the experts since the dawn of recorded history have told you you must do pay the price by becoming the person you want to become it's not nearly as difficult as living unsuccessfully make your 30-day test then repeat it then repeat it again each time it will become more a part of you until you'll wonder how you could ever have lived any other way live this new way and the floodgates of abundance will open and pour over you more riches than you may have dreamed existed money yes lots of it but what's more important you'll have peace you'll be in that wonderful minority who lead calm cheerful successful lives start today you have nothing to lose but you have a life to win", "ErRsMTmdQb4": "let's meet the next act we might stick it to Penn & Teller  most people think you're either born creative or you're not that is so far from the truth

there trying to fool them [Applause]  a randomly selected member of our audience please welcome the inventive magic of Adam Wilber Thank You Alison thanks so much what's your names Tony I'm Adam pleasure to meet you nice to meet you can I borrow a dollar bill from you I do have a dollar beautiful you from Chicago I am all right that's where I would keep it - perfect perfect Tony I'm gonna have you do me a favor I'm gonna have you sign this and I'll put a little box so you know exactly where to write for me so if you put your name right there that would be excellent now a lot of people ask me why I do magic for a living it's a kind of an honest and interesting question and the answer is pretty simple for the money see how easy that is when you're a magician now Tony we're gonna get back to your bill in a moment but first since we're on this beautiful stage I figured I'd show you something cool would you like to see a magic trick perfect coincidentally you have exactly the right amount  welcome to Vegas my friend now before we get to that I want to tell you a little bit of a story about how I got interested in magic when I was a kid see I used to live down the street from a magic shop and the guy behind the counter was an interesting dude but he used to do the most incredible things with money I'll show you the very first thing he showed me when I walked into his shop he had this little wooden paddle it didn't look like much to me it had pieces of paper on each side with money signs on them that's three here three here again doesn't look like much until he did the magic shake watch careful Tony it looks like this and now those paper have turned into pennies that's three here and three here I was stunned to silence myself I get it now this was at the time the most incredible thing I had ever seen in my entire life keep in mind I was six years old right but so incredible that I bought the effect I went to my house and I spent the better part of a week changing paper into pennies and laughing to myself like a crazy person the entire time now at the end of a week when I had enough money I went back to his shop and I said to him what do you have that's a little more substantial than maybe pennies and he brought out little colored sheets of paper and four of them to be exact at this point I wasn't too impressed but he said wait till you see what they can do so Tony watch careful we're gonna take four of these pennies I'm gonna place them right in the middle of this trash paper we'll call it that for now very fairly all I'm gonna do is fold them into a little bundle of trash paper essentially now at this point as a little kid I wasn't too impressed much like our audience here today nothing happened just yet until he did the magic shake he opened this up and to my surprise he had five times the money he started with watch careful because those pennies have turned to nickels  so of course I said ring me up I went back to my house and I spent the better part of two weeks changing paper into pennies and pennies into nickels laughing to myself like a lunatic the entire time now this time when I went back to his shop I didn't even have to ask him what was next cuz he had this little brass cap already sitting there waiting for me didn't look too impressive but for this can I have your hand to demonstrate put your hand right in here and a little higher I'm gonna take the four nickels and I'm gonna place them on the back of your hand now it's important you keep your hands steady is if you don't those nickels fall off into my hand now I'll do this as slow and fair as I can Tony can you see the nickels on the back of your hand yes I can can you feel the nickels on the back of your hand yeah and can you see this empty weird looking brass cap I see that weird cat watch this we put the cap over the nickels and we wait now of course we need that magic shake this time I do it Oh beautiful and a shake for you perfect now Tony be honest does your hand feel a little bit lighter than it did not so much see it should because dimes are lighter than nickels or dimes from for nickels thank you very much you so I went back to the magic shop and I asked the guy do you have anything with foldable money something I could actually make a living with and what he showed me next changed my life this thing right here at this moment not too impressive but let me show you what it does Tony is this your bill that is the one that you gave to me yesterday I appreciate that thank you very much now we're gonna put this right here now watch careful all we do is slowly roll this and you'll see that one dollar bill change from a one to a hundred thank you  20 can you verify that your name is written on the back of that hundred that's my name that is my name now penny teller I have a feeling you might think I'm using some sort of word play or trickery but I can assure you I'm not see this is Tony's bill because this is Tony's signature so Tony thank you very much  Tony I'm gonna have you take us home compliments with me don't worry I can make many many more let's all give Tony one big round of applause  [Music] [Applause] I love that creativity process of trying to make a problem that's both entertaining and fun to watch but also fooling at the same time do you have more tricks in the pipeline that you're sort of I do have a few that are far-fetched ideas but I think that's where the best magic comes from thinking way outside of a box of impossibility and then whittling it down to something that's a happy middle ground you know you like wake up in the middle of the night would like an idea I gotta try it yeah anyone here always keep a notebook by your your bedside and it's one of the the biggest keys I can give you okay looks like the guys are ready guys I want to say before anything that magicians are never classy they always do these things or they change the dollar bill into a hundred and they change it back and do some sort of laying joke about keeping the money or keep not've itself given the guy the hundred dollar bill as a souvenir is classy and the way to go we've never seen a magician do that  now we all know these words they're just gonna rattle off really quickly we all know paddle moves cap and pens and Mbutu money mystery we all know those and those are done beautifully in a really nice routine but the question is how did you get the signature on the gun and there are two solutions that we could think of and I want to ask you one question before that and that is can we look into that Halliburton case you have there please okay we're not gonna we just we just want to know if we could share we have a huge amount of information once you said that and if you were bluffing on that you're a genius just a genius so I think that that little question-and-answer gave us a little window into and into how you might have done this trick a little bit of a way to frame the whole thing and and get a very clear idea of how you ended up giving that guy a one dollar bill turned into a hundred with his signature right on there is a wonderful wonderful actors thank you very much but no window whatsoever I know where you're going absolutely not no in the world shape or form now and we can look in the case yes  [Applause] hey wait Oh exciting people oh there's no window in there yeah I don't know what that means  [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  the situation both y'know see that coming in and clearly neither did Penn and Teller let's see if we have another fuller on our hands after the break [Applause]", "4BZuWrdC-9Q": "Translator: Phoebe Ling Zhang Proofreader: Yolanda Zhang Allow me to introduce you to these five chairs Because they are the real protagonists of this speech They send us a special message This information is about What behaviors and attitudes we bring to the world Now i want to use An own story to explain what I mean I once tried to get in touch with a particularly important person Build better relationships This man is my partner's twenty-year-old daughter To build a better relationship I think Can arrange a wonderful night for our two girls to spend together I chose a special location Blue Note in Milan That night my favorite jazz band the Manhattan Transfer Stage performance We met at the jazz bar We have a good time together I am happy The baby boomers love this band \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music But I can't help thinking that she will like the music too Thinking of it, I turned to see her Guess what i see i see She is playing on mobile What should i do I have several options Choose one Please what is she doing She is playing mobile I take time and effort Planned this wonderful night to bring her here and then I stared at her for two minutes She's playing mobile phone right there What's wrong with this generation It's hard to keep them focused for a few minutes my God (sigh) Choice two This is really wrong (laughing out loud) Why should i take her here She's suffocated and looks uninterested and doesn't like the music What am I thinking about? How could she like this kind of music This music decades ago She guessed that she had spent the whole night with a dinosaur Oh my God Choice three Be calm Count to ten deep breaths Don't rush to conclusions You don't know what she does with her phone Take it easy take it easy Continued Cup (laughing out loud) Choice four What really matters to me Spending a night together is special She will feel that she can really open up to me after this night She will feel safe with me I always open a door to her. This is what really matters to me I really hope this can happen Really looking forward Choice five What is important to her What is her world like now What does she care most I really hope to build a close relationship with her What do i need to do (sigh) I tried to answer that question but couldn't think of the answer Just then she turned to me and said Louise do you know this is the whole of Europe The only Blue Note One in New York and two in Japan Milan is the only one in Europe So cool italian She went on, oh I checked the Manhattan Transfer Did you know that they performed together for 40 years It's so cool Then she said, look at this She handed me her mobile phone showing a circle of friends just sent It says Blue Note in Milan There's the Manhattan transfer There's a perfect night with Louise Too hanging I almost ruined it all Because I will probably give her a very unpleasant expression on this chair And she might already be talking to herself This Louise is a master of control She has a hard time getting along Must be upset with her This is not what i want at all Actually she was fully engaged She is here Multitasking in the digital age records the real world into the online world It does n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a second I will probably ruin the good moments we created together This happens frequently to us What we choose to do for this world What choices we make directly affects Our conversation Constructed relationship And our total quality of life So what should we do on a practical level To help me pay more attention to these Because these things are not taught in school The school curriculum does not include things like how to deal with people So what can we do So I thought of this theory of five chairs It comes from a nine-day course on non-violent communication I took The course tutor is Marshall Rosenberg, an amazing person He did a lot of work for world peace After the class I feel like my life has changed I decided what I would learn from the course Apply to the actual workplace I spend the most time in the workplace Acting as mentor, coordinator, trainer, etc. The workplace is also where we do the most controversial behavior Sometimes even harmful So the theory of five chairs can help us slow down Help us decide what to do at every moment in our lives And help us analyze the situation Let me do it now Take a closer look at each chair and explain the meaning behind them First is the red chair Jackal chair Jackal is an extremely intelligent and speculative animal They always look for opportunities to attack Actually this chair is the one that we have the most wrong behavior In this chair we like to condemn, to complain, to punish, to gossip. But what we do most in this chair is judge others If you don't believe me I invite you to a spiritual introspection event I invite you to spend an hour with some people See if you can be out of your mind for this hour Make any judgment Ask yourself Someone came in and we started looking up and down I like it i don't like it no interest And we know nothing about them So this chair It's a chair of judgment There is another game I like about this chair This game called me was right I have always been like this Until one day my brother gave me some feedback I used to treat my mom like this because she always liked exaggerated expressions For example, she would say something like this Oh yeah 30 people attended our house party And I corrected her first I said mother was wrong. Not 30 people but 13 people. Look, I'm like a female inspector Then my brother touched my arm Remind me that it doesn't matter if she says so, I respond strongly to him What do you mean it does n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter, of course it matters, she \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong For her sake, her mistake has to be corrected in time. He touched my arm again and said What you want is to live in harmony with your mother I still want to be the right one I learned an important lesson Since I always take my mother's exaggeration as a manifestation of her satisfaction In other words, on this chair we tend to Focus on the weaknesses of others Not advantages Mother Teresa warns us The more time we spend judging others, the less time we have to love others The next chair is a hedgehog chair The yellow one About Hedgehog We feel particularly vulnerable when we act like a hedgehog Cowering to protect yourself from the outside world that you consider to be evil What we do in this chair is to judge ourselves relentlessly Which means we use this red chair to treat ourselves We would say words like this i'm not smart enough I can't do it no one trusts me We often have fear Fear of rejection, fear of disappointment, fear of failure We always play the weak Subconsciously thinking nobody cares about me nobody loves me But in fact When I explain this chair theory in the company I will ask those managers Where do you sit most of the time Hardly anyone would sit on this hedgehog chair This is because sometimes it is difficult to acknowledge our weaknesses We need a lot of courage Yet each of us struggles with self-doubt But what if we do n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have self-doubt? Will we give up and compromise? Or will you refuse I want to find resources to grow Krishnamurti said something wonderful He said that the highest form of wisdom is Ability to observe but not judge yourself Next chair This is the bonito chair I do n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if you guys have seen me There are n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many bonitos in Italy but this is a group of very amazing animals When they perform guard duties They can stand upright like this for an entire hour Moving the head all hour is just the head Extremely alert That's what we did when sitting in this chair We pay careful attention We observe a pause We take a deep breath to stay conscious This chair is called slow and slow What i'm thinking i'm talking to myself In this chair we became curious If someone gets angry, we wo n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say please please mature Instead I want to understand why this person is angry We want to know the answer So this chair is I can't help but think of Nietzsche He has a famous saying that fits this chair He said you have your way i have mine As for the correct and only way it doesn't exist Then we have a choice here Red or blue pills This is a sliding door chair Now when we make the right choice We went into a successful life Next chair It takes us into the world of investigation Why investigation This is because we become our own detectives Sherlock Holmes We take a magnifying glass to examine our behavior This is a great chair because here we have self-awareness We know who we are know what we want Know where we are going we are not afraid to say our true selves But at the same time we have established our own boundaries We take good care of ourselves in this chair We are very very powerful We don't give up our power In this red chair we give power to others In this detective chair we grow and we become free We have all the power We become bold but not aggressive Aristotle once said that knowing yourself is the source of all wisdom Our whole life can be on this chair Why the logo animal is a dolphin Because dolphins are such a wonderful animal They please smart and communicate elegantly When I think of dolphins You think of the best we can be as human beings Next chair This is a giraffe chair Very beautiful chair Not easy to sit on I'm not sure if you guys know The heart of a giraffe is the largest of all land animals So big Not only does it have the biggest heart And the longest neck So it has a particularly wide field of vision When we sit on this chair We will show empathy, compassion and understanding When we are in this chair, we will completely give up narcissism. We listen to others We help when others need us Understand yourself It \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big deal Abraham Lincoln once said I don't like that person i need to know him better So this chair represents an invitation Invite you to see things from the perspective of others To accept other realities Accept diversity Become tolerant The most important question on this chair is What is most important to this person in front of me The purpose in this chair is to maintain relationships no matter what happens That's what all these chairs symbolize So how do we apply them to our daily lives? You can imagine going to work yourself May be a speech The speech went smoothly So you sit in this chair and think it's great Or maybe you did not go well in a conference So we sat on these chairs Our daily challenge is to understand how to find the balance About sitting here or there being balanced Because if we sit here, life will not be very happy But if we sit here on these chairs We are more awake and more open Smarter and more thoughtful The works that impressed me the first time I read them are Victor Frank in his book Live Meaning Everything can be taken from a person but except the same Ultimate freedom Is to choose our attitude in any situation What a powerful rhetoric Then next time you want to get angry with your child Or when arguing with your partner Or punish someone at the office Try to come to this chair and think about it If you happen to sit on this chair This happens often Can we summon up the courage to say sorry Then correct every mistake Now i invite you to take these chairs home Practice them to make them part of you Teach your children these chair stories and they will immediately understand Put these five chairs in the conference room See if the meeting goes more smoothly And the next time someone annoys you Think about five options for five chairs Can we all work hard to make our home Our office and the world are getting better It's enough to try one behavior at a time Thank you (applause)", "DQSiygnDm-U": "a lot of ultrarunners have struggles or addictions and like what allows us to go so deep into a pain cave and I keep thinking what is it that allows Kourtney to Walter to go into her  [Music]  Portland do Walter was the first woman over the line this weekend at the 2018 western states endurance drivers Courtney do Walter Nadeau Walter has set an American record in 24-hour running she won the Moab okay yeah I heard before D rather heard about it yes she she beat all the men by 22 miles you have had success on the track success from your my own racing you've had success that shorter stuff 50 miles what's the deal when you talk to her she seems so normal there's no team in there like waiting to meet a demon right you know I'm like where's your demon like are you getting through that ha ha her demons a quiet demon right it's it's there it has to be  copy six o'clock in the morning three hours to race time it's good right I mean I'd like to see how fast I could do 200 miles now that I have like confidence in my legs that they can cover that distance I'd like to see how much more efficient we can be with it it's not a full cup of you finished this they're just topper uppers the crew is a comparative there yeah their job is way harder this is decimal degrees and this was  anything and everything can and will go wrong so you just try to plan as much as you can up front she's doing that on a roll so my crew is my dad did you do it [Music] Mike and Stan  he's uh like a mullet business in the front party in the back kick it back [Music]  that's the secret sauce right there creamy mashed potatoes and then Mike has done tons of hundred mile races and he'll push you through some of the darkest times for sure and Kevin's just Kevin I think every one of her Pacers are gonna say the same concern is that she's gonna drop them I'm a mid pack guy you know and I know it's 200 miles or whatever political can run but it's working well socks do we choose to take or do you think lucky thinks perfect hopefully she doesn't run another six thirty or faster mile like she did at the end of Moab because I almost got dropped there and I think getting dropped twice a year would be embarrassing x-factors having dick when I was growing up he didn't miss one of my sports of us so cool than have him here my number one I feel like as a crew we'll be successful if at the end of the race Courtney feels like she did everything she could that she got the most out of the race [Music]  [Music]  I think that she can do the race in two days the course record is 58 hours so maybe we're in over our heads but and we're gonna try it and if things go go south and we'll troubleshoot and figure it out [Music] I set goals like that just so that I'll like hold myself accountable to keep pushing when it gets hard and not to like I don't know like settle and be like oh that's fine we'll just finish it like I want to keep yeah like pushing through and seeing seeing how fast we can do it and so the goal is you know win this thing because that's gonna make sure that I keep looking for the next person  [Music] I think I get concerned with any race it's just it's a lot all right guys yeah  [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  she has such a genuine love for being outside and just running and pushing herself to see what she can possibly do you'll hear a talk about and it's genuine we talk about it when we're running together just on a you know summer run I think it's just curiosity she's always had the desire to do her best we always told her we didn't care what you did as long as you tried your hardest at and it may be stuck wear my lucky shirt oh Emily she had a maliki socks I couldn't ask for better people we're just very grateful that we had people that can put down 40 plus miles [Applause] [Music]  yeah we're guessing 1015 warriors you came through 10:30 so Wow like clockwork I'm so good at guessing you know quick  [Applause]  [Music] I have been running my whole life she had done her first 50-miler when we met and she asked do you want to pace me for a hundred mile errands like you're gonna have to explain like I didn't know that was something people did the 100 mile race didn't go so well I mean I was like laying on the side of the trail just kind of whimpering and then decided to drop out of it trying to sit with the fact that I had just quit got me like really fired up and I was doing a hundred mile race then and it wasn't going to be an option of quitting  so I guess people would say that my run rabbit run 100 win kind of like made waves maybe where people were like who's this person in long shorts and what is she doing at the top of the podium her ultra awards they're all kind of tucked away in and storage that was pretty awesome that Courtney got the cotton candy won because she loves can buy so embarrassed she just would never brag about her accomplishments have been really interesting watching her progression I'm retired professionally retired so yeah I would pro teaching jobs will always be there and we've got something that I could go back to it's like living my dream everyday I wake up and get to look at the Front Range of Colorado and choose where I go that day and for how long I feel really lucky to be able to be doing that and we'll see how long it is [Music]  I have to waffle and Cucina she was definitely ahead of schedule and I think at one point we know she was coming to age stations 2025 minutes ahead of where we were expecting her there's some athletes that come into the sport and like hit hit it being successful right off the bat right well with her she's had failures that she's had to learn from and so her progressions been very natural and just amazing it's like okay I've done that she knows she can do it right so what's the next boundary right what boundary can I break  it was just baking hot and I think it was just so hot and so sunny and no wind at all that everybody got overheated [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] and she definitely got she was struggling to eat enough calories and her stomach got upset because of the heat is my guess more anything we can to that you can take and I mean if you want to carry what she's quite nauseous yeah yes like I eat that big Newton in Leadville right  honestly my biggest concern was that she was not gonna get enough calories and just have a major bonk you know we were just like Suns going down pretty soon she'll be able to be running when it's a little cooler  [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  going back up  yeah see you soon great okay see you  in a few races when things really start to go south you can kind of see the gears turning like I know I know this feeling I've been here before it used to push her to the point where she would get I mean sometimes really emotional like she'd start crying but now she's like okay and I know this happens and I just need to be strong she just has this ability to be hating life and be able to push through that I think she's an incredible problem solver and she can figure this stuff out and tune into what her body wants and pays attention to herself it as much as we all think that she's a goofball and she doesn't pay attention to anything she's very in tune with what's going on around her how are you  [Music] thirsty posed to mental oh but then it also became physical when I was like throwing up you know everything I was eating the first day so I was like hit two times by these like weird things that don't normally happen until past the first date usually this was unique I've never been in a low for so long and had no reason for it like great from the get-go my brain was in just a weird state for it was like not processing that I was racing and getting to do this thing and so everything just felt like more of an effort  you know Kyle was you know had kind of separated himself when I had picked her up I had checked where he was and we were about eight miles ahead of him maybe nine miles ahead of him right around there and then we got to the next aid station they told us he was at seventy-five miles or something like that but which basically put him five miles behind us or something and all of a sudden Courtney's like he's closed three miles on us she was just like we got to go and she just started to pound it up the hill and right out of that aid station you do this huge climb like four or five miles and it's steep and rocky and she was running  [Music]  turns out we basically maintain the same and a distance she was just not able to run as hard as she normally felt like she should you know I feel like if she had been able to not have the stomach issues from the heat I'm totally confident she could have been running a lot of this stuff quicker than we're going in at a harder paced and we were going but you just got to fight through that  good yeah I'm good I got plenty of time to drink dude you just crushed it so bad everything I could do to stay with you dude  so what's the next section do the next section is out ten miles and it goes up for a while then goes down  [Applause]  normally in these ultros I ride a high and then a low and then high again and this one was just like it started and kind of a low and then just sunk a little bit deeper and then stayed there like I couldn't find the other side of it ever for the first 20 hours I think I was just like fighting for every mile which normally doesn't happen normally there's more highs in that first Park especially but I couldn't find it for some reason I don't know what factors were going into that  learned a lot of hard lessons in those those first ones but since then I mean every every race she's kind of fine-tuned more and more and I don't know if there any secrets in this sport but she's kind of figured out how to get through just about anything  they're just not sitting well cuz their stomach so I'm side down so maybe pancakes and maple syrup God knows I would have eaten it because it's training up and it's a lot love them yeah she came in and we're like do you want to try some pancakes we had two cheese quesadillas and we're like if you want to try some pancakes with some syrup and she's like that sounds good alright she got a little piece down and I was like she's deleting so yeah it's like five o'clock in the afternoon we know it's hot and sunny we'd like a cheese quesadilla and there's some pancakes I think she relies on the fact that no matter what happens we're still on her team we still love her to death this is this is icing I mean this is fun you know and if this all goes the way tomorrow god did we have a freaking ball so much of it comes from her mom and dad her humility her overall approach to life it's too important to enjoy your life to get all worked up about the little things  she doesn't run ultras to get interviews and be in magazines she runs sculptures because she loves to run  [Music] [Applause] so the time you're going about seven days I have to like pick up so  see you tonight seven huh yep have fun second place I think he's only like 12 five miles back now he's been he's been cruising he's coming he's coming in one battle would be real fun [Music]  whoa see she's gonna probably just want to look at the profile and I have the sheet on my favorite tunes by cooking so nineteen thirteen and a half six nine  she got hooked up with a coach in high school for cross-country skiing his name was Randy Gibbs and he was really really good at getting every little drop of talent out of these girls that he coached he kind of taught them the idea that you could go away faster than you think you can and you can go away farther and you think you can and after being with him she figured out how to go really far going and competing in Alaska in the winter and having to deal with the cold where they had duct tape on their face so they wouldn't get frostbite and all that kind of stuff and she went through a lot of this pain and suffering and learned from a very young age that that's not the end of the world  she came into Sierra Tahoe her high school cross-country ski coach was out there to see her I mean you could just see her light up this is a man who had a profound impact on her her cape boys as an athlete this is the guy he taught me everything I know about basically going into the pain cave like that place where it really hurts he was the one who taught us how to go in there and be okay with it you got anything I need to know about  I've been down this road here with her she's a stud out there they go away  and it was really cool then to have it like come back full circle horns for him to be there with his daughter nice to meet you thanks for coming I'm not a crier but that was really emotional and like just really special to see him again  sophomore year she went from being like pretty good to all Son winning all the races basically like she just realized this I don't like going second she went from being someone that didn't really ski she was a runner you know and next scene when she's winning the state meet and skiing people have been skiing for ten years longer than her I think that's it it's a burning will to be the best she hates losing more than she likes winning him you know we had six mile lead maybe at that time and we know it had closed down to within two she was in the pain cave for I was with her for 11 and a half hours out there on the trail and you know there wasn't a whole lot of highs for her unfortunate was just a lot of I got to do it you know  they're 19 miles in into the segment route spacing urn she was just like well that kind of sucked you know whatever my guy he did great and she said Mike just be mad with me for a minute or whatever so I was like yeah I kind of suck you know and she's like okay no service I don't know it's just so what she might quickly gave us the update that yeah she's fighting to sleep and sleep running this is quite an adventure  well that's that tough GPL you know the only tough Chiefs get to do it yes I'm gonna give up let's end this delirious sleepless society  [Music]  really  was a little hard on her I think she was kind of anticipating it because people had been feeding her information that he was getting closer and closer and I think when he was about two miles away it was 30 miles from the finish and she is like I can't redline this for 30 miles I'm just gonna do what I can do and if he passes me so be it I'll try to catch him again  he was a lot more rugged and I was anticipating I think it was more rugged than the first half of the race just couldn't open or not back she just went open it up a little bit they can see each other's headlamps I'm sure my guess is I'm super competitive I mean if if I could have I would have held on and held them off  it had been such a hard day from the very GetGo and there we were like 40 hours in or whatever you know when he finally passed and it was like I don't know if I can fight anymore  so this is the last aid station Kyle last check was a little ahead of her she'll just give it or go and see if she can reel him in hurry up and we hope she's not disappointed or upset I think she gave her best right I mean she wasn't out there quitting she was fighting the whole way and that's how you can ask for right it's just put on table and a sudden you know something beating somebody beats you but she's not off to compete the women's team other runners and I think that's pretty special great job Cort and she looks at me and she's like 50 I got to get in before 50  you want any of that and I need to please the 50 our goal is one of those things that did really get her fired up and gather  remember that yeah seven miles okay yeah got a new character I think I just had to set something like we had missed the other goals we had you know the other like big aspiration that we had for the race and we were looking at the clock and I was like is 5th a sub 50 our finished possible and he did some math and he was like yeah but you're gonna have to work for it and then I was like okay fine like let's let's do this because I needed a reason at that point to keep pushing really hard because it hurt so bad and that was the perfect like you know carrot today we've gotten run 40 minutes go get it he's the ultimate crew chief and and pacer [Music]  I joke like you know he's just Kevin but he's like the whole thing was everything [Music] she's got no a gift but her full physical abilities have come from so much hard work [Music]  she's gotten a lot stronger because she worked so hard but that's not I mean that's what I've seen more change but the foundation of all that work is she's so strong oh man sorry this is really telling you Hallett how amazed I am house she's just a really amazing person what I've seen in like the last three years just her physical ability is developed so much from all the hard work that she's done where she would go run a hundred mile race and for like five six days afterwards she would be wrecked ultimately be able to function after a week and now it's like she does a hundred mile race the next day yeah she can't sleep you know she's fatigued her body's killing her but within two or three days we're doing shakeout runs or we're you know running around in her ability to recover has been just amazing compared to what she was several years ago I don't think there's anything in particular that's unique about her per se I think it's something that other people can do I do think she's gifted genetically with she's just wired a little differently maybe something that Courtney has learned and that she's gotten really good at is that when you think your body is telling you to stop like maybe you don't need to stop and it's a challenging thing to do but it's absolutely possible for anyone she's not running away from anything she's just running towards the to see what can be really darkness  [Music] [Applause]  I was still thinking about her goal of getting to you know under 50 hours she was really hoping to get in by 11 so she has less than 20 minutes to get them those last two miles she's close really close [Music] Kevin how we doing right to the last moment when you just push yourself to see what you can achieve [Music]  I think it went incredibly well Courtney had nothing left when she crossed the line first of all she didn't drop any of us so truth be told we're all fired up about Dec we had so much fun I don't think she's ever satisfied I mean she always knows that it's always possible to go faster I've even seen where she's won a race and been frustrated that she didn't do as well as she could have we talked about how it was all going when I was pacing her she said this isn't going nearly as well as Moab but it's almost refreshing like a reminder that things aren't always gonna go well they can go very very poorly but even so you can still do a great job I need to come back and do it better basically the whole second half I'd like to change if I could I don't know yeah I mean situationally we had like things come up that we had a problem solve which I love doing but we just didn't solve them as fast as I wanted like I didn't solve them as fast as I wanted and so it caused the second half of the race did you just be much slower but that's okay that's part of the fun really I'm even more proud of her then and it wasn't Moab seeing how hard it was on her and not being able to eat for 140 miles that's really hard on your body and for her to keep pushing through that and move at this speed dad was incredible and if there's any lesson that I've learned is you can never be too surprised at what Courtney can do I don't think yet she's found that breaking point there's gonna be some good stuff to come yeah we're gonna see from her Whitman just she's capable  you  everybody's got a demon yeah I don't I don't know that I have a demon I think I don't like to fail and I want to finish everything that I start is that a demon [Music]  [Music] you", "82ovWoZ1gGI": "all right now your body John Meadows here I got a guy to train with me today he was just walking around outside I said hey do you mind working out with me today he agreed you guys know this is 27 times mr. Olympia eighteen time are no plastic champion well I'd love to think that so Jay Cutler's here he's gonna take me through a workout Jay has a style that you use that I want you guys to see I'm not going to tell you what it is so let's just get to work I'm excited to actually be I hear I've heard about all your training I see a lot of your athletes out there I'm still curious to see what kind of goes behind with the people I travel I travel all these different places and I get to see all these different here's a lot of theories out there right the internet changed everything for us all right so we've always started when it was just magazine it was a magazine and I remember reading magazine articles and I've seen your stuff and to see actually videos now it's a lot easier than I used to try to make these guys come alive in the magazine when I would watch so much workout routine so now and your your theories can be shown so much better on video so you know I'm a high volume trainer so we're gonna see how kinda we go through is how we mix and match and stuff and she would see what the viewers think out there I think the interesting thing too is is our health this is this is this birthday man this birthday catch a newfound 46 47 here I started training when I was 12 what year did you start - I started when I was 18 and 9th I started August 3rd my birthday okay 1991 I started 1991 okay I did my first show in 1985 I was 12 so that's when rocky 4 came oh we were just oh I know and that's what inspired me to get into weight training so my friends and I used to have an hour to two hour long conversations where the rule was you can only use rocky for lines like anything you say to each other has to be a rocky four line so you know like you're gonna have to go through hell but I'm looking at Paul cause they're like you're gonna have to go through hell remember Toni's lying there in the cabin in Russia so we just used to communicate with rocky lines ahead so those are all the one-liners it makes it easy when you're training and I wasn't a vocal guy when I trained so nowadays I had to open up and be a different person I think a lot of my viewers and even people that watch your chest will see that I'm a different take Cutler one down when I was competitive because when I walked in the gym I am if you said to me J I want to do a video with you back then I probably would have said no thanks because I just wanted to Train right if you watch my old DVDs which was my old early social media no see I never said anything in the gym I just kind of did my thing and I remember thinking oh man I can't I'm dreading this guy coming to shoot my video for the week but then it would be so successful and that's what created my fan base by showing hey this is what he does on a day-in day-out basis because listen people watch from how you load the weights how you know what you do in between sets so it's often now when I'm shooting a lot of my YouTube stuff I try to get my gotta shoot like hey what goes on in between the set because this is that mine the muscle connection we talk about it all the time to get into our theories a little bit I think we should do a little sit down and talk about it but like you really have to understand how the muscle works functions and everyone's genetics are gonna be different so we're you know you might have an exercise that works great for you it may not do anything for me so that's why everyone needs to learn their own thing and not just say okay well that's what Jay Cutler did I'm gonna follow that exact routine you know use those routines but work your own way become your own versus absolutely well certainly what she did worked and worked for me you know the interesting thing too is I think about willful we're gonna do another video where we do like a mortgage Q&A what works for you at one point in time sometimes even changes and you know in some way like you like you're trying to get to your ultimate genetic potential so like trying to squeeze out that extra 2% of 5% could be the difference between you winning or getting second like that little bit even you know John did I actually reach my potential we don't know because listen I'm I was stubborn so I did have people that trained me advised need but I be honest man I was pretty open-minded I look at an amateur that wasn't even close to my level in her magazine they say man I'm gonna try that exercise I see exercise in the gym today that I never would have thought about doing I was a standard bench press  and we had variations of that right but now you know you see these different things these guys do in the gym and sometimes I'm like why is this guy wasting the time doing that but at the same time if that's what keeps people enthused because we know this that gets monotonous our lifestyle right you talking about the diet like the day-in day-out I mean we're very superstitious where we don't want to change a lot that's what worked last time but you're right you put on a pound or two a muscle it makes a huge difference on how you go into your training and your nutrition and when you get lean you can only train so hard you can't go balls to a wall that you could have done at 16 weeks out when you're four weeks out you're just kind of unfused control and you have to know when to shut off your mentality to say okay I can't push myself beyond because then you risk the injury and then you're not in any shows right that's one of hard lessons I learned actually I used to we'll talk about that yeah that's a great point so all right today we're gonna go as balls-to-the-wall as we can I've been up since 4 o'clock this morning if you all here with delays but the highlight of my career today it's always my workout but it's more important because with John today so let's get it all right so two sets to go by feel I caught him steal sets I hate to say warm-up because I think I'm warmed up when I get to the gym anyway so let's do a weight  two sets just to get the feel I'm going to be like 15 reps each set and then I'm going to my working let me do follow me to a quarter you know they say okay well I'm just gonna do what Jay does sometimes that's a mistake right cuz injuries or you're gonna go in there I usually usually things because oh that's where you feel sets get everything warm and yeah rock and roll  [Music]  [Music]  you always say 12 it's like your number you know I do so much volume that I don't and just go and I critique the muscle I don't really have to push beyond failure because I like it a little lower so I can get under perfect specially with that - I'm getting you that your yard styles a lot like mine where I'm I was very explosive oh I don't know but I'm control explosive you know so what's his sloppy but I always felt before when I everything I do was like that it's like I was up me and I was a ballistic trainer I always so there yeah I do mind I do everything like that but but like length also do  you really go with it so Spy vs yeah like I don't believe in the slow some of the guys train now and I'm like I don't write like I don't believe in this kind of you trying to see somebody doing exercise you got some experience no I never trained like that in the beginning no break through the movement you know  training disease although born without that aggression to  [Music]  just so cool watching that it's like everything he's doing like [Music] no momentum like I could just so cool to see somebody else do that I don't think your chest is weak is it no that's a pollution no anything happen or you just barrel-chested  [Music] I'm a Zach that's only five  so the most common thing people ask me is about permitting upright like how have we determined to go like you today your school was eight you get 12 sometimes you think you're like okay I'm gonna get this money but you keep going so I make sure I always have a rep range between eight and twelve reps not to say I won't go beyond that but eight seems to be the number of like and my question to you is how do you determine eight instead of a six or a five I still think muscle fatigue should fall between the eight twelve where people say well how do I know you start to get that burn or you start it like beyond failure like if I pushed any further reps to me that's absolutely point because witness is our first exercise yeah if he's already doing failure says for three or four repetitions you're dead by the time because I'm a 20 sec ice hole we're rolling through 20 sets for this workout total so I'm gonna do four or five different movements you know three or four sets each I mean you're gonna be maxed out so when you're spilling on the first exercise late maybe on the last set is okay but if you're gonna train the volume you can't go to failure all the time but if you're gonna do something odd only suggest one set per movement max without pushing too many repetitions sound familiar so I don't I don't I don't follow your stuff exactly but I can already tell from our first exercise that are simply of similar momentum the Mindil muscle connection we talked about which is not built in beginning training it's it's something you determine over time absolutely you have to learn hope that my normal connection and controlling the weight so we're going to move to a dumbbell movement nurse oh okay what I do here is I go into three sets we do three sets depending on how we feel but my beginning thought processes three sets so I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm not gonna do any kind of feel set so I'm not going to warm up [Music]  these are rubber weights anyway these are lighter than real weights  [Music]  [Music]  so what I'll do on a couple after a few reps is I'll stop and I'll connect to the contraction and then I'll call back in fact the movements so but definitely twelve here right [Music]  [Music]  [Music] well  [Music]  we'll go grips these bricks  [Music]  yeah yeah  we stand with this I was going out there me [Music] is it 12 right I could definitely probably get 12 with I'm going over this 95 yeah I'm thinking 95  [Music]  eight  everybody me of John 1313 lucky number 13 five four my goal is actually u15 I can't think out there [Music]  [Music]  Oh  easy dirty in the corner I thought he was gonna do 15 I'm like alright so same thing I'm gonna keep the seat a little low so if you guys need to adjust the seat because I what I'm gonna try to do with this I'm actually trying to get low so I can get when I come out I'm actually gonna try to squeeze everything so down and up kind of  so I think hand position is important people grab these I try to grab in the dead center of this okay okay where I noticed like on the hammer I think you grab a lot closer than me did you notice on the hammer he's more in like I'm more in the middle I call that the cheating way by the way you know your way just two beers  see my chest arch right here [Music]  he's got healthy shoulders his range of motion that's a guy there who has really flexible health and shoulders  [Music]  you know when the surgeon went in when the surgeon went in to do my biceps hair he opened my shoulder up he was he said I figured you'd have arthritis your shoulder will be a mess I was 38 who said it your shoulder looks like you've never lifted weights in your life you removed that's what he told me yeah but you know what I contributed to [Music] absolutely that tissue work because when I started working Chris Cormier led me to this guy yeah enduring the ages to see him he was in Orange County and my when I would pose everything was I couldn't open my lats it's kind of like the way we talk about a guy it literally it made my shoulders like 3 inches wider because I was like this and when he opened me up I was able to train a lot different so when you remember when you're closed you can't train so once the shoulders got open and I was able to get that flex I was able to really improve my back a lot because my back was you wanna hear and I didn't have no fan because I couldn't get the flexion of every you know you want to poke that pull up I just didn't feel my lats and always into my shoulders so I was able to actually use my lats you can see that your shoulder mobility you can see it's really good  [Music]  [Music]  oh that's burning baby that's burning [Music] but unfortunately we have social  faster  [Music] for exaggerated for me but [Music] see since I don't use this machine so now I got the rhythm right so I get rid of the speed [Music]  [Music]  mmm  all right  [Music]  yes sir  you should see this from the side when he does this remember that's important so really keep that soul to keep the shoulders back watch the best night  no but are you gonna get huge [Music] remember you don't have to come all the way and touch these things what existed contractions think about really contract to just think about squeezing the chest more than touching the things together so you don't have to touch those that's actually going to pick  [Music]  [Music]  I cut a sword such a Piedmont horn I try to tell people earning range of motion down so you keep your body positioning  stemming it all right it's got the vote it yeah that doesn't have zero sleep  see you how farther and come with this yeah then I'm close to touching right chest oh man  Bank  well there's 12 reps yeah I am calm that's how I know I'm in the Riddler with always because I just go and I'll say how many reps 11 12 and I don't count any of those ropes it's just by feel you know you just get that you used to that you know  Chinese dragons news  let's go [Music] yes  very common what we do is we tuck the chin that's where a lot of people would say that I was wrong before you to do it but I know my chest is worthless I can feel my chest come up and bury my turn  with Hani in over a couple years and he told me head back it just didn't feel the same I bury when I press it's just a safety thing for me but I  [Music]  No  [Music]  it's like these guys together  it's gravity those rockets  okay so what's the next exercise whatever you say  [Music] nice  right  nice  see how he lifts up into the contraction I always want to say  like what to see what if just gonna get you'll know after for us  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] hmm [Music]  this is you can adjust yourself in the bench on where you want to be with it right that was hard  later  two three [Music]  six seven eight Bhopal nine right there right there right there bring it down there you'll break it down break it down keep your form one one more pop rap alright good job alright so the most forgotten exercise a cable flyes okay which a lot of people don't do because they're too lazy to bring the bench over to where the cable station is where someone's can't been out of the cable station so what I like about any cable movement where the misconception is when I started training people like all cables are for finishing movements is booked it's you have that constant tension where you with dumbbells and barbells you have a point where you kind of lose a little bit with momentum where with the cables you you don't have that that loss of the contraction so I always suggest some sort of cable movements whether it be for biceps chest training even sold are some of my favorite shoulder exercises the side laterals with the with the cable you don't get that momentum you know back movements obviously people do a lot of cable movements but that constant tension is great I still focus on twelve reps this exercise actually burned more than all the other movements and as I as you see I didn't really push to failure because I was doing so much volume but with this I push the closest to failure but just because the tension is a lot more it's time under tension when you do those table movements I wouldn't suggest starting necessarily with this exercise I still like to go to the meat and potato exercises like the presses but it's a good exercise to really engage the muscle and get that extra blood flow in there the legs stay underneath whereas with the chest train you got to lean in a little more and you're gonna contract and you're gonna see my movements not very it looks like it's not really doing that much but I'm actually contracting my chest through the movement I'm gonna try to focus on 12 repetitions and with this even at 300 pounds I never had to do attached weights actually Charles Voss led me on to this moment I'll be honest he's the one that kind of I think people who believed in these a lot which help  so I want you to watch how I do these I am I used to really admire vince piranhas work and he had a style of use on these once you tell me what you think of these I typically  which I could believe in my feet were out front [Music] really with the pressure on the chest yep [Music] now if I asked you where you felt the movement the most would you say lower pecs outer packer - all around that it looked to me it looks like it's work by this yeah  because you're just kind of sitting there and that groove - what's your what's your best body part  damn straight probably  do you like training chests I had a couple years where my chest was really blown up I always liked the side chest like that but um where I struggled was my back  they got pretty good eventually once I was come here so get on so far driver my back gave me fits I do a bunch of exercises where but it's like it worry earlier I had to do some that stuff [Music]  no I switched back and forth it's the strangest thing but people always ask me that I didn't have a theory for it but I know if I was to do dips I would always face out so I would always be like for triceps I would face out and then I can never face it because I figure okay going in there's going to work more my chest it's a mental thing for me and listen the handle with the handle thickness makes a difference too on the thinner handles I can't I can't do it I feel like I read tear my chest  yeah I'm doing here yeah right there  [Music] see visually that much I guess  yeah we did these in Virginia yeah yeah you can really see it that's why it has to it looked like I mean you're sure it's tighter than my leg [Music] that's how you can tell when something everyone's gonna have that groove if you try to put him I want to see you in this and see what it does all right not now wait there's what I'm gonna do to like your viewer from your not condition though so though look at the fix J we're where volume trainer what Jay just said is was too many cookies for this guy over  I have my think back a little bit yeah great where you I just go find my feedback like a little bit  I think having it on the end like you had it facing the other way is a lot better for some reason I felt that better you're away so I just changed my whole theory of doing chest dips based on mountain dog training stop that's a cut that snippet out through a replay so I do plan a comeback  [Music]  [Music]  I  I knew when I trained with him - but why so  these guys in gym be like ah let's make them throw up and in eventually I'm sure  I'm not trying out and when people like my thought is I don't try to kill anybody I just try to kill myself I mean hey if you get a good workout that's great but I want to push myself squeeze that chest good  [Music] yes or said I got this from Gironda but he actually I think he just seemed like way down all right so that's chest training with Jay haha yeah yeah yeah I don't what gonna be like Jay so hope you guys enjoyed that workout it was really awesome for pollen I doubt J train with us hope you guys enjoy it let us know what you think and we'll see you next time", "_lnaOyvFw9w": "[Music] what's up guys another fun day of training on the road we actually just got into town here we're in Scotland and actually found a pretty good June from the looks of it where we're all really excited because we were coming to a somewhat small town and we are unsure of what we would get into as far as a gym but we dropped our bags got a text from Eddie saying hurry up guys five minutes please please hurry yeah so all of us are down there waiting for Eddie and he's not there we go down and check out the river come back we wait for Eddie for at least 15 minutes at least and we hurry yeah we're heading yes we did yeah there I like are a cool walk we're all tired red we had to film this morning whatever and we get to the gym and the first thing he does is I'm gonna go get a haircut so we've got to the gym and I spotted a barbershop at the side of the gym so I said to Brian I'm gonna go get my haircut and he looked at me he's like what we're here to Train but I know for a fact Brian takes that long to do his first set I could literally have a haircut have a shave get in there and he still would have done his first set so this is the test 11 minutes later  all right you can drop you can go after me you go before me water back on either them trying to show up in this jumping you can wait we can do something he does it  there's no argument afterwards there's gonna be a down call we got to go below the chin okay and one of us will call it down feel so when you say Blair the chin just touch the bottom of your chin right here for me it's beard long as you guys that [Music]  to see you go YouTube music  [Music]  our last second to last I won that machine you want to get first no I don't want to go first all right you go to search for first and second item don't suck it up lots of that cycle  [Applause]  oh the first second  laughs I'm just the chant they brought in this chair maybe there is another way for the downfall yeah no no we're not gonna mess with you here we go come on set the bar let's go let's go I'm gonna overrule the office about that charter back your ass has to be against the bench yeah yeah that's pretty common for correct yeah  the now  Wow about  down down down want it down down down down down for the cards down  down hurt it down Oh 35 37 down  Oh  what  now  oh god I really miss couch I don't know you work I thought I was right on but obviously halfway through I was like yeah you might be right okay 43 I'm 37 and that's 42 they will say if you argue if we get close enough we'll count back gonna have to put the rap counter on the from petty would be doing it hard doing like making sure you lock your elbows it makes it a lot harder than just pause it  are we going we're 43 but if somebody else gets 42 43 then we'll work our back  so  so  Wow  come on break it up come on come on aah  [Music]  the top sack of consumptive them  you know the worst part about it is his smug look at no practice is a very Cayley [Laughter] [Music] now hold it down now  Oh  No now now  now  though now  nobody if you're back down to get your rocks back 22 dude an equine pension then  go yeah  down down down down down down down  so  hop though  ha  one more revenue that comes out he would go I really do oh I wanted to pause and be like how many do you get but I didn't have the gas no I know I know I was like I'm not sure he's gonna get this I'm not sure he's gonna get it well you know I didn't cut it short jail beat you I pushed that I pushed that yeah oh that was good dude Jesus thanks man Eddie sound the bar in question and those on it still got it you in all honesty how many times did you go about 40 reps and training though all the time everyone but every week yeah  60 qo dumbbells for 40 50 reps but the paranormal that's a very normal yeah yeah I was trained for injuries and shelters yeah and it's amazing how much blood I feel like I found on my shoulders right now and my triceps nuts yeah it's not a normal I mean I don't normally have that feeling so it's kind of fun to kind of fun to get out of the comfort zone you know but it's it's I mean that's crazy that's literally what 14 or 15 reps more than what I did that was what you guys it's a good good mark on her show it's also the nice thing about having all of us is like our different strengths and everything yeah but if it was just you and him working out he'd be like damn and he'd beat me by that many reps but because you and I were so close that's a nice way to gauge were definitely yeah that's fun I mean it's a good good competitive thing I mean I'm now thinking in my mind I mean obviously I think 15 was 14 or 15 was a little bit I was really good I could I if I knew you were gonna do 29 could I have done one or two more and now I'm frustrated which is good it's a competitive see I'll tell you what my ears are ringing from the last one you put I can't stop it Tony yeah it sounds fun that was a lot of fun I was in the same on bench fries yeah I'm then come in with a normal bar just one in all plates let's go for it yeah same shot yeah I mean you're not gonna be great at this and I'm totally burnt out but I'll do it but he doesn't want to do it are you worried about doing it with this bar because I beat you in back so do this Chris go if you want I'll just hold on the handles unit through the Swiss bar and I'll do the proper handles in the middle and you guys can do whatever you want so we're doing are the rules for this then so I'll lock out again and then what a quick pause on the chest yeah will happen I think I think it's only fair that we know boxing so if you bounce if it bounces of no rep yeah so you're gonna have it even a split second just battle limit it'll limit the reps make it harder and they get there so we'll have to come down to a pause and then back up and we'll call the down again the handles which way round there you go this right here is a lot of power one of us has to work and there's going to be a point where we hit a wall and that's going to be that because we're already fried would you like me to count on this one side you see that please have a hard time otherwise okay I don't know why you guys expected me to count anyway sounded um it was a bad choice right get better down calls I'll handle the countdown all I have to do is remember one word down  both sides of the ball that touch your body otherwise you can just touch the bottom and cheat it so top and bottom so touch your body on flat yeah it's a touch of no bounce as long as it it'll be your discretion whether it's a bounce okay so as long as it's coming under control you can't just dive on it I'll give you down all right let's go come on let's break them out the stroke now that wake it up now now if you don't wear the muggers call this out  No  so  now down good reps now down good job keep it up now come on you're not tired  I'm going to close market them down  now down down getting clothes that come on down don't make me take one down  27 let's go  now  ow  download otherwise I think it's it's better like as a judge I want this to all be successful so I'm not going to take it if I think you're really working on it but I'll bet the kid giving you warnings like that I mean look I feel like you were very lean he didn't eat it cooling it because to me he didn't wait for like eight of the first ten down calls I think he locked him out fully though I thought I felt I I'll keep my judging consistent for the prom here's the problem with that honestly is if you're gonna do it he knows he's walked out I'm not just debating that but waiting that split second for the down call for teach you more so it is  I'm gonna did you out honestly how many did you not wait for charge accounting I just say down now I know but you let's go big man I want all of us to succeed I really do I really do I'm sure I loved everyone out which I did so it's very fair referee and Rob is very very impressed honestly I'll just but since you had to say something like someone to say this I was just really surprised that his triceps for that week I felt like I had to help them wow it's cool cuz I'm actually resting there's a big difference it's your lesson  now  now No  now  so down  now Wow down down down  well  what's that 25  [Applause]  touch me - they have not in charge of the numbers but asking me numbers by one  but 2016 all over again feels horrible when the referee is so corrupt it's all corrupted I waiting forever down called up I thought you were gonna cheat it way more but you just you just did it I just played it straight in one excited in a win yet I'll just be Eddie gotta remember I gotta remember one wrap up [Music]  [Applause] your way  down south  now about  Oh now well  one yeah what's that  smell them nice there come on down let's go  down come on they filled up this long as you're back locking  yeah to to flight nearly locked our wraps okay to miss and then to come back after that's nearly impossible your wait  go  [Music]  well  [Music]  [Music]  dummy by one so 22 23 31 31 30 32 those good guys honestly yeah it's so crazy the difference in those two you know the feeling but again you put the numbers out there like there's no way you're you're stopping before you beatnik and there was I didn't even know where I was out no once he told me the number I was like oh I can't stop before Nick it's like not measuring cuz it's Nick it's just cuz it's competition yeah yeah Dallas I really did put it all out on both of those though both of those I put everything on that feels good I mean especially after being tired walking in a little bit of competitive nature here it's actually made it this pretty damn fun it's nice when when you can't push each other and like maximal weight but you can push each other in another way that is just not talking because I beat them in a reps event well when I don't really train relying on a minute I mean if you actually out of the wraps the difference between the two no separate inside result I think if we look at the drop and tell how many reps you did there was how many did here or how close Brian was for the same on both that means consistency and your fat lard but just drop really hard teacher yes please  okay so if the overall winner today was Eddie the beast hole we can all agree on that well we were we having an overall did you just make that up I just made it open it stick o gonna get a trophy made yeah yeah to add to his what his one trophy has a little backwards do you air  I'm not sure that's a compliment that's not a conversation how do you want to get into it they don't think isn't it no I think I've actually had more than yours I will give you the deadlift is by far the king of the mountain but let's go check he was trying to do is walk off I just hit the home run that I did with their triple over first base a lot of fun [Music]", "MRuRj1XNW0g": "three two one go it is on number one versus number two fifty point one in the 2015 Reebok CrossFit Games season is underway yeah you know it's been a long time in we've been waiting for this and this has been a repeat of the game haven't never wanted to go to head-to-head but give me a break let's start off with this first workout right out of the gate it's the first thing that popped into my head was grit intention not only are you hanging on that bar for all those rep when you're overhead but now you got to deadlift and then you've got the snack you have nine minutes of pure just grit busting you got to be Popeye for this one that Fraser was first off of his initial set of Kosovar I got to that barbell first is now on to his pride matches the leaders name will be highlighted in blue we have nine minutes fifteen toes the bark men deadlift and five packages 150,000 that is on the fifteen point one eight so things are going to get heavy the mat Fraser finishing first he has a round down as does rich Froning and Fraser right back up on the bar for fifteen Kosovar and we were talking about you just stop these athletes barrels there sir easily in comparison to what they give you is that rain devotional disorder a little liars YC because the meat of this work out of the Kosovar I think going to have the advantage of on that single effect that did not look very pleased when that Rubin was it out no you know he's been working off a little bit of a hip injury instead he was actually worried a week ago to be able to getting those bar I don't think he was real excited about that for he did I fit line up when they did that one rep max - is that just later that Fraser with a slight lead on rich Froning we have seen in the past 14.5 comes to mind when it was with Ed against the ribbon and the thrusters burpees over the bar workout rich brownie didn't go out first he finished first but he did not go out for he's a master and evening and that's exactly what it says worried about the first few men before he's on the last year out what he's really trying to do is he may need Matt engine really pushing that have to be very careful here yet his endurance has really built up over the last year and a half Rizzo but he's gotta be careful so strictly aid very very consistent brownie on the Left Frazier on the right rolling just a couple of reps behind Fraser shouldn't be a problem chance to make up make up and down camp and broken up and three senators boy am i Monty's got to be a smart move allow his regrets you really aren't gaining a whole lot by taking three to five seconds I mean I think that's a smart move on his part razor was off the pull-up bar first and waited for birdie to get there trying to recover and grimmer a little bit but it's barbell that he's got is a minor inconvenience this is their active rest portion but what I love about these guys both of them are very confident waters of the other Aveiro their opponents they know exactly where everybody is which unique line now is a totally free trip watching a whole lot but that and very obvious and is watching you turn it on and waiting for the permanent come back and take that rest nothing that does on a regular basis Fraser has three rows down and now rich Gordon three rounds as well we have left the big finish to go in fifteen point one remember immediately after this at the 9 minute one second mark at fifteen point one a the line of reps back we never get six minutes to establish back and he does it basically going and every minute on a minute for this rat for this just round set up I just don't know if that maybe something should be able to move on usually is very very good at that we've got started out with about a Kippy 354 round round on the first set start to slow down a little bit but who's going to be able to hold on to that the locket in the left hand workers cleaning which is Jimin Mukul 10 Athena trusted may have steering their man on the four-time Reebok CrossFit Games champion and he is still a couple 11 behind Matt Fraser and they now work through round 4 and deserts on that barbell a 115 pounds that Fraser when he's on the pull-up bar woke up in tones of are for the first time now let's change that I do see Matt gunas he's going right from the deadlift right into that fat very comfortable at the pass so I think he uses his rest as water your sad-sack bar these are pretty good on his part because he's confident with that that's not really worried about it but after all that break they end up at the bar at the same time after a boy of fifteen point one we're pretty much dead even both athletes on their fifth round Fraser was about a 1 to 2 rep lead on throwing throwing is off the boulevard raised about McCallum are now we see consistent breaking of those Kosovar and these athletes as bill said trying to save their grip Fraser with you to go and here comes rich Froning and they are tied but Fraser slightly in the lead as event make their way back to the barbell for the fifth time say what's an acne about the straightest is not real heavy so they're not really having to worry about the form they just have to move that bar then we treat it as an air squat but you can see how they are they are going that alternate grip I mean it saves their hands and I'm worried about it rolling out of the fingers anything is a vector if - this particular workout is going to be gigantic razor still lightly ahead of rich Froning you can see that Frazier is looking at McLaughlin will do that as well trying to pays off that round five is in book both men back to the pull-up bar and exactly the same time and got the running gear speed about a 105 Lin right now they started on it a nd 455 they really have it like segregated that much at all and we're coming to the last half of the workout clothes coming off the pull-up bar at the same time these guys are pages of each other at all I mean come on no they absolutely are they know what's going on they know where they are thieves at risk arrest just enough Colette bangin his forehead but you can tell were enlisted I'll be pushing them on the toes the barn and I really think that mascot he would feel what we're cooking on then I mean a lot of Morgan get stuck that broken and then needed you like really break it up more they want you wrist roading look a lead but it disappeared the second that they pull put their hands on those barbells Dignan a half down in 15.1 rich Froning has one day open every year 2011 that phrases didn't have a center and you only feat rich in one workout that was 40 point 500 of 95 pound barbell there's rich Nuala written those best resting at the top on a light weight moving all the time that's where I didn't he hasn't happened more than anyone he thought crossing the movement he's green in a lot of us tend to forget to breathe while working out and now a mixed grip on the toes of our for Matt Fraser and he is a drug rep lead on rich Froning both breaking at the same time flows through 185 pounds as we approach the 90 second left part of this event 15.1 here in Canton Massachusetts it's going to be decided probably by a couple of reps away these fewer zone and they're just going here the raptorettes back and forth Valley it's amazing how fast risking come back after you left it so then they get right back in the barn the exact same time rolling off the pull-up bar furs Fraser right behind him and now both been nearly synchronized on those set limb  roschmann mayhem on the bottom of your through hearing on ridge burning from Louisville Tennessee let's put a minute to go with 50.1 and we are still not at up and here we go now Rick's usually he does have that rest as usually so far ahead at this point in everything one and grounds has been about or wrapped ahead of all right there again is always business and there goes now watching like though is is that's what I wanted to see bogies up here again ago to see just what they need to do now is he's going to hang onto the bar final 30 to go and still Matt Fraser just in front out of four times in a survivor place running and now we are tied again with 20 seconds to go you can see that often  Rhoni was a to roughly wages got to make up some ground five seconds ago you got three razors off the car and Froning is going to take it by three reps whew that was insane I was absolutely incredible absolutely incredible and again it's the painting the fridge has he just has that an afternoon of science the guy knows exactly how fast and how far how hard he can push himself just about at the time so me it just doesn't matter round one to rich Froning and now fifty point one and six minutes to establish a 1 rep max green and jerk half the loads are old barbells and they have to use the exact same barbell that they Union in fifteen point one let's take a look back and what just happened in fifteen point one barbell no problem but it was Cola for putting up well that's it just on the pull-up bar it was the transition he rested and that's what a lot of prospects seem to forget designed to move from one position to the next position taker Tom's wedges fans back take some rest take a breather worth mattress looks right on in there but that goes right back to build on top of each other so every time rich fell behind on the last two events Alaska movements he would make all the distance and be extra rested when they went to the bar and then when it came down to the end it was all just about wrist pull on that thing and really making it happen grip was a factor in that lavender it was a factor here to everything this whole thing compiles a grip but not only now is physical the different because they're going with one run Mac and I used to want to right now but I think smart movement you're going to see you guys it's going to be a play with joining a lift / - this is 275 pounds per Froning is one rep max is listed at 376 or desisting 475 that phrases one rep back he did it back in November 375 pounds the last time we saw heavy barbell Sifu invisible running rep overhead squat one of the 2014 Reebok on 16 steps what they were not on the floor at the same time no and even though they weren't they were both watching and playing off the other characters in their Heat so here we are again where these do the best of the best are going to be watching each other I'll tell you what I really think that matt has the expanded here because if you get to play some game are you going to add another extra pound on there than the other person are you going to kind of bait them into going into it and then actually see what they're going to do and add a couple pounds off before you get that last 295 now for bad grades or he doesn't look easy again that's his background I mean you want to talk about like getting a workout handed to you this is one thing he's good this is what he's done for years and years so you ask an Olympic lifter to do to clean of dirt keep smiling which is what he did when they announced razors look at confirm with the church away on it look if not that effective what he'd ever be happy robber if nothing else it was a hey I know I'll get it one wrist groaning hidden 300 less than poor to go here Matt Frazier is putting his shirt back on that'll help that bar stick to him what he catches it so again that's not being very smart he doesn't want that bar to slip out of position any kind of bad position is going to be wasted energy can't afford to have that right now it looks like 305 degrees 11 on the leaves on that and Fraser that loop of power now here's the what 315 about Fraser down the lead by 15 pounds now here's the hard part John you're not going to be able to do this every minute on the minute we need to be very easy about how many ways this is like oh and I'm smart move that I'm playing that I'm turtling through which is what we never series do we always things off but it's a smart move but how many lives you actually going to have in this six minute time frame will have to recover then you want these lips to count you want to be a little heavier so how many are you going to be able to get after the question is um for rich Froning 325 pounds of a pudding of 510 pounds on that freezer and we have a minute in a half it is criminal how easy these guys are making this look at the city level good live out for Matt Fraser so now we're getting into the one-pound increments as Matt Fraser has gone to 327 to take the lead with protein you know they've also they've all done The Price is Right game you really go up by one more dollar than the never and ever and nothing else that's going to mess with the other person find out here's the game and this is what Matt's going to be able to deal with he's going to be able to sit there and watch just to see what they're going to do because guess what it's a smart there's going to be their last lifting see maps are in - it's done you do your last hit with the last 20 or 15 seconds left and a pin so you gotta go big that's 343 correct  and that was how the dam back in the Legion 30 seconds ago and praise her answer he's still holding waste onto his bar suck our Zola's judge is counting up the weight Ranger adding more weight he's down to about 15 seconds 345 this will be more the wind escorting is frantically loading his barbell razor has it up five to go cronies on exhibit Fraser cannot keep it the rich roading will win 15 for what a is Matt Fraser has one final limb that try invested camp and just couldn't hit the dirt that was more perfect he did not get exactly what he was supposed to do he just wasn't able to get that last one on hybrids up with proteases what the heck I want to put on a show and made one more attempt but he will walk out a Reebok CrossFit one and Massachusetts the winner of fifteen point one and fifteen point one a 343 for Brody now the church it's permanently gone oh there it is yeah it's going to come off that foot Ritchie's done for her now let's go back let's go back to the lips risk went big is exactly what he need to do there's a twenty pounds off that's exactly what he needed to do you can tell he was struggling through that and so the whole time during Rich's lift max watching you saw what it was he had to be able to go up and above that so there was actually a switch of the weight and then that went for it and just I think got himself rushed and that's the problem and you wouldn't get too close to that that buzzer you're out of position no I just like to be able to catch it that's where he went down that's a weight that fresh Matt Frazier usually has no problem with again is one rep listed max is 375 pounds so there's your final score for fifteen point one a rich Froning beating Matt Fraser 343 pounds to 320", "awtmTJW9ic8": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs Reviewer: Ellen Maloney Imagine this... You have just won ten million dollars in the lottery. Congratulations. (Laughter) You have just eaten the most delicious, warm, chocolate brownie that has ever been baked. (Laughter) You... have just had sex. (Laughter) And you... have just done all three at the same time. Congratulations to you, too. (Laughter) In these situations, our brains produce chemicals called neurotransmitters which give us these great feelings of energy, excitement and happiness. And without such chemicals inside of us, we wouldn't feel such emotions during such pleasant circumstances. So instead, imagine this: You've just been fired. You're about to sit an exam. You have depression. In these situations, our brains, instead, produce different chemicals, making us feel stressed and anxious. The highs and lows of life are controlled by our emotions and these chemicals in our brains. This vital organ inside all of us that controls everything that we feel, think and do. However, as a biologist, I've always found it strange to comprehend that every feeling, thought, and action that we have is controlled by a three-pound, soggy lump of cells inside of our heads, until I discovered that this might not be the case. The story I want to share with you today unfolds a fascinating new revelation in our understanding of human physiology, that we each have a second brain, another organ in our body which controls as much of our physical and mental functions as the brain in our heads, and which may be the key link between modern disease epidemics, globally, from obesity to cardiovascular disease, maybe even to mental health. But first, to give you a little introduction to this story, I want to tell you a little bit about my background. I was brought up in a family of psychologists. My mom is a clinical psychologist; my dad a professor of psychology in a university; my sister even has a PhD in psychology. So when it came to me going to university, I wanted to study something different. I'd heard enough about the brain and how it worked at home so I wanted to study something new. I considered what I was interested in, and I figured out that from a very early age, I'd had a big interest in food. I loved eating food. So, I decided to study human nutrition. And this was great because I got to study food, how it affected our bodies, how it could contribute to disease, and more importantly, how we could use it to fight and prevent disease. This story begins back in 1845 with the birth of a curious young boy in Russia who became an incredible man, but who was forgotten by history and medicine. Ilya Mechnikov was fascinated by everything in nature, and by the age of eight, he was taking notes on all the living things in his vibrant back garden. He became so good at science that he discovered the role of phagocytes, some crucial cells in our immune systems, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1908. But it was his science after winning the Nobel Prize that was even more crucial to our understanding of human health, through a tale of discovery, death, and self-experimentation. See, everyone in this room has something in common. We all spent the first nine months of our existence inside our mothers' wombs. And this was essentially a sterile environment where no other living things existed, just you. But as you emerged into this world, you were smothered in an invisible coating of microbes, friendly microbes from your mother's birth canal. And these bacteria grew to form what is now a three-pound invisible organ inside your large intestine, the same weight as your brain, and which has become known as our microbiota, or microbiome. And this invisible organ has grown so much, in fact, that right now, 90 per cent of the cells in your body are bacterial cells; only ten per cent are your own human cells. So you are more bacteria than you are human. (Laughter) This ecosystem of microbes in your gut is as diverse as the Amazon rainforest. Thousands of species all with different functions. And your health is incredibly dependent upon the life and vibrancy of this rainforest. Your gut bacteria digest certain foods, produce essential vitamins and hormones, respond to medicine and infections, control your blood sugar and blood cholesterol levels. Meaning the types of bacteria in your intestines can significantly control your risk of certain diseases from obesity to diabetes, maybe even osteoporosis. They're involved in just about every process in your body. They function almost as a second brain. Well, Ilya Mechnikov may have figured this out himself in 1892. He lived in France, in Paris at the time, where a deadly cholera epidemic had broken out with thousands of deaths. Naturally, as a scientist, he decided the best way to study this was to drink a broth of cholera himself. Remarkably, he didn't get sick. So again, as a true scientist, he needed to increase his sample size, so he recruited a colleague to do the same thing. This guy didn't get sick either. But when he recruited another colleague to do the same, this poor guy got critically ill and very nearly died. By studying cholera under the microscope, Metchnikov found that certain species of bacteria from the human intestines supported and stimulated cholera's growth, while other species prevented it. He subsequently claimed that our gut microbiota, or our gut bacteria, were essential for human health, and that the right balance of microbes inside of us could help stave off disease. However, popular understanding at the time, was that the human gut was a noxious reservoir of toxins. Surgeons had even begun removing entire sections of human intestines in patients with gut discomfort. Mechnikov's death in 1916 meant that his ideas that our gut bacteria were good for us were forgotten. A decade later, antibiotics were discovered, and drastically became overused. C-sections became common. Diets became Westernized. A war was waged on microbes and we spent a century trying to kill them, which turned our intestinal rainforests into barren wastelands. This Nobel Prize winner's ideas were lost in time. Some of the implications of this were identified recently. See, right now, one in three children in America are born by C-section, meaning they don't get this initial innoculum or coating of bacteria that's been designed by evolution to be in the mother's birth canal. Instead, they're first coated with other bacteria on the skin or in the hospital environment which has contributed to up to a 25 per cent increased risk of obesity, asthma, immune deficiencies and inflammatory bowel disease in later life. Fortunately, in recent times, we've realized we must restore our relationship with gut microbes for our own physical health. However yet, we've still completely underestimated their role as our second brains. And this is something that I'm researching. And I learned this first through the intriguing story of a mouse. If mice become colonized by the microbe Toxoplasma gondii, an intriguing thing happens: they lose their fear of cats. (Laughter) In fact, they become attracted to cats. (Laughter) In essence, they go a bit mad, and unfortunately for them, usually end up as dinner for cats. (Laughter) So, this microbe ingested by this animal takes control of its brain, and changes the way that it thinks and behaves. So, by delving deep inside the intestinal jungle of bacteria in our intestines, we've begun to find some incredible discoveries that are changing our appreciation for bacteria forever. See, our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways. First of all, our intestines are physically linked to our brain through the vagus nerve which sends signals in both directions. Interestingly, even though if this is severed, our intestines can still continue to function fully without a connection to the brain, suggesting they have a mind of their own. Secondly, our brains are made up of a hundred billion neurons which continuously send messages to tell our bodies how to work and behave. Well, interestingly, our guts have a hundred million neurons. Thirdly, our microbiomes are the centerpoint of our immune systems, meaning a disturbance down here can cause subtle immune reactions all around the body, which if prolonged, can affect brain health. And finally, do we remember our chocolate-eating, lottery-winning womanizer here in the front row? He demonstrated for us the neurotransmitters are these chemicals that can change the way we think and behave, and how we feel. As it turns out, most of these neurotransmitters are also produced in our gut, none more so than serotonin, nature's antidepressant, 90 per cent of which is produced in our intestines, less than ten per cent is produced in our brains. Meaning the types of bacteria inside of you may control the way that you think and behave. Has stress ever messed with your insides? Have you ever had a gut feeling? Or butterflies in your stomach? You may have to think twice about that. So, you can see, despite my naive reluctance as a teenager, I've begun to study not only one brain, but two brains. In the APC Microbiome Institute in Ireland, we're fascinated in this link between our belly and our brains, and we research how our modern diets and lifestyles are impacting this gut-brain relationship, and how we can design interventions to target the microbiota in order to prevent and treat chronic diseases. For example, we've shown that the types of fats that you eat throughout life can drastically change the types of bacteria that decide to reside in your intestines. In addition, we've shown that by feeding specific strains of bacteria, it can enhance memory, stress behavior, and stress hormone levels in animals. And in addition to a number of other researchers worldwide, we've identified lists of foods that can act as prebiotics, or foods that can stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria inside our intestines. To me it's fascinating that our health is so dependent not only upon nourishing ourselves, but upon feeding other living microorganisms inside of us, meaning future strategies to target and treat chronic diseases, including brain health, may depend on targeting or feeding our gut microbiomes. As it turns out, Ilya Mechnikov may have known this himself. See, much earlier in his life he married, but his wife quickly became sick with tuberculosis and died. The stress and trauma of this led Metchnikov to take an overdoes of opium. Thankfully, he survived. He then re-married, and when his second wife got sick with the deadly typhoid fever, this time he injected himself with a deadly tick-borne disease. Thankfully, he survived again. It was only after this, Metchnivok began studying and appreciating the microbiota. He moved to Paris to work in the Pasteur Institute where he began hypothesizing the right balance of microbes in the gut could help stave off disease, and he published a series of books and lectures describing how to achieve this and prolong life. Despite the stress and mental turmoil that he'd experienced in earlier life, he spent the rest of his life dedicated and obsessed with researching how to prolong human life. He began studying an interesting group of people in Eastern Europe who were living exceptionally long lives, and he noted that they all drank bacterial-fermented milk every day and he suggested that this contributed to their longevity. Interestingly, he began drinking this bacterial-fermented milk himself, and seemingly lived a healthy life rid of the stress and mental turmoil he'd experienced in earlier life. Maybe that was just coincidental. He described the time in Paris as the happiest of his life. But Metchnikov died in France in 1916 at the age of 71. The life expectancy in France at the time was 40. As humans, we all need to adopt a greater appreciation for the microbes inside of us. The incidental war we've waged on bacteria over the last century has led to bacterial extinction and sparked an epidemic of modern plagues. I'm here on a Fulbright to research how we can restore our relationship with microbes, and how this can be used to prevent and treat chronic diseases. But I feel that we all have the responsibility and the potential to follow in Ilya Metchnikov's footsteps. Not only to revive his scientific findings that were lost in time, but to adopt his desire to prolong healthy, human life. Whether it's by educating ourselves on the risks and benefits of C-sections, restricting unnecessary antibiotic use, or by adopting a gut-friendly diet and lifestyle, we can all support the life of microbes that we've evolved to live alongside. So imagine this: Imagine you've just eaten chocolate, or won the lottery, sat an exam or just been fired. Imagine your thoughts, your emotions, your behavior, and your health could be controlled by a hidden organ that you knew little about. Ilya Metchnikov fought to not only prolong healthy human life, but healthy microbial life. I feel we can all contribute to this fight worth fighting for our own health, but more importantly, for future generations' health by restoring the relationship between microbe and man. There is some food for thought. Thank you very much.

This is called the garrison hypothesis. An idea that has evolved over hundreds of years, It became more popular in the 19th century, But it still affects parts of the world today, especially Africa. This is the subject of my book, To be published within months, Entitled The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, scientists, and theory that changed a continent. This story - Well, I should tell you that I'm a historian of exploration, This is my job. I'm looking at explorers, missions, And cultural encounters between people around the world, And why do people at home believe the importance of these missions? And the story of the missing white tribe that I'm going to talk about, And the garrisoning hypothesis, I grew up from a book I wrote ten years ago Entitled \"Frost Crucible\", it was about exploring the Arctic. I could not imagine that this book is about the Arctic It will lead me to my current project, Because it was about the Arctic, And the garrisoning hypothesis is about Africa, But it originated from part of the previous topic. I was writing about exploring the Arctic. I was particularly interested in American explorers, And how it happened in the 19th century If American explorers find something interesting to go to the Arctic, It is a very dangerous place. Many Americans lost their lives by going there, Either they try to find a northwest passage or reach the North Pole. But I found the story of an explorer named Wilhelmor Stephenson, And he went to the Arctic, Not to get to the North Pole but to discover new peoples. When he was in the upper Canada region In a place called Victoria Island, Discover a group of Eskimos that they described upon their return By being the Eskimo blond. I thought this story was the most bizarre one, but I couldn't stop reading about it. Stories were widespread in the United States at the time. In fact, the world press spoke On the blond Eskimo on Victoria Island. Some people thought that it was a fabrication, And it is a hoax. Others thought It is an amazing discovery that needs explanation. But this story was not helpful to me, It had nothing to do with what I write about. So I put it in a file, And what I found was that for the next six years, I was finding more From the stories about these white tribes That people around the world have discovered. For example in Panama, (Richard Marsh) found a group called the White Indians. In Central Asia, There is a group of people who say they have found Tibetans who look like Aryans. And in parts of Africa, people found white tribes as well. And in Japan, people discovered in the late 19th century A group called the Ainu on the northern island of Japan, They are said to resemble Caucasians. So by 2008, I had a huge file on discoveries of strange white tribes, And I thought it was time to do something about it. But there was one story that I particularly interested in, It was a story of discovery Happened in East Africa in the 1970s - In this red square - It happened west of Lake Victoria, One of the largest lakes in the world, It was discovered by one of the most famous explorers, Henry Morton Stanley. And Stanley may be known to you as the person who found Livingston, Or who saved Livingston in the heart of Africa in 1869. In fact, the phrase \"I think you are Dr. (Livingston)?\" Stanley told her to Livingston when they met. This was one of the most famous missions of the 19th century. But Stanley has returned to Africa many times, And on this subsequent mission to Africa, He didn't go to find Livingston, But to discover the sources of the Nile. He taught people at the end of the 19th century With so many lakes in East Africa, This is what we call the Rift Valley in East Africa. And this rift from the lakes will be the source of the Nile, This is what geographers have searched for 2000 years. But (Stanley) said: \"I will find out which of these lakes are the source.\" So he made his way into East Africa, and set with great confidence Lake Victoria is the main source of the Nile, This is the source of 4,000 miles from the Nile. But he also discovered something that formed a new mystery, That is, there were members of the African Recruits Squad That protects him with white skin, He called them \"Greeks in white shirts.\" It did not understand how these Africans had light skin. And he asked other members of his campaign, \"Who are these men?\" They said: \"They came from the mountains in the west, From a mountain called (Gambaragara). \" So he wrote about it and sent these reports back home, And illustrations of his story show Mount Gambaragara In the upper left with the illustration, And you can see it in the background. And this story has become famous in the homeland, This is the lost white vein Stanley found in Africa. How for heaven Stanley was able to explain it at the end of the 18th century? What kind of theoretical background or information could people use? Why would you find a group of whites living in the heart of Africa? In fact, for Stanley as a 19th-century man, In the transition period Between using the Bible to explain world history And use science to explain world history. So when Stanley thought about it, He regained the look of the Middle Ages, When people try to explain the differences That we see in the people of the world, and we call them ethnic differences, Going back to the books of Genesis, especially Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story, And in the story of Noah, we all heard about Noah and the flood, But most people do not know what happened after the flood, As Noah's Ark settled above Mount Ararat, Where he got off the ship with his family and three sons, Sam, Japheth and Ham. It was the three sons who believed many people in the Middle Ages - And so I talk about Jews, Christians, and Muslims - All of them believed this story as an explanation How to rebuild the Earth after its destruction in Genesis 9. And as you can see here, This medieval map shows Noah's three sons On the three known continents of the world. Asia, upstairs - and as you can see the ship is upstairs, Hanging on top of Mount Ararat - Wissam bin Noah, and to him attributed Semitic. Then down to the left of Europe - This map has been rotated to the east, by the way - On the left, you can see Europe and Japheth. Then the origin of all the Africans, as people thought, They were descendants of Ham. So when Stanley talks about this white tribe, he says: \"Somehow, they must be linked to the Ham tribe.\" And they became known as the protectors. But this is a transitional point, (Stanley) was a deft man Not only was he reading the Bible, but he was familiar with Darwin as well, And he was reading (Charles Lyle), who started, logically, He opposes world history in the Bible. People like Darwin and Lyle said The world was not 6000 years old, but hundreds of thousands of years - And they had no idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039the actual age of the world, But it was very old, moreover Races were not constant over time, but they changed over time, In fact, humans may have been similar to something else. So (Stanley) started adopting old ideas And merging them with new ideas. And many people did the same at the time. Strangely, the protective hypothesis, It is an idea that all Africans descended from the descendants of Ham Ibn Noah, Strangely changed to \"No, not all protectors are African, The protectors are a white group that invaded in the past, This invasion of eggs Explains why white tribes are found all over the world. \" Now, if this sounds weird, let me just emphasize something, This was not a weak idea, like You know, scientists looking for strange beings Or who are trying to prove cold fusion. There were anthropologists, linguists, paleontologists, All kinds of scholars in this field Take care of it. This map, for example An anthropologist called Griffith Taylor, And who is trying to describe what he saw Such as the ethnic dispersion of Asian groups around the world. Now what you see looks like a rounded map, But just to direct you here, the center of the map is Asia. And as you can see, There are initial outflows from dark races. Now, I think (Griffith Taylor) That the first races of the human race were primitive, Late races were more developed. And like most Europeans and Americans in the 19th century, When they considered primitive and evolving, They looked at it from a racist perspective, And primitive means dark skin, and sophisticated means light skin. So they made a color map of the world, To give you another example, he named that similar to the lava flow, That all races of humankind started in Asia, And gradually The most advanced late races, meaning white race It prevailed over other races and spread Where it conquered, overcame and prevailed On people of dark races around the world, Whether by mating with them or by invading them. So this was the idea that explained Why are white tribes found in strange places? That was well matched With what was happening at the end of the 19th century, As new white clans seized other places in the world. As the Europeans went mad to own the colonies From Asia to Africa. In fact, this map of Africa is from the end of the 19th century Color icons appear here They are different colors for European countries: Brown for France, green for Great Britain, blue for Belgium, and purple for Germany. It divided Africa as a whole among European countries In light of their attempts to establish colonies. So the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039a white ancestor previously did the same I agreed with the way the Europeans thought of this period, And when the European colonists came to these regions in Africa, And they saw different groups of Africans, they said: \"These are the protectors, these are the first whites. Let's treat them differently About black Africans. \" So during the end of the 19th century, Some groups like Bahima and Patosi in Rwanda, And (Nyamwazi) in Tanzania were laying eggs, And other groups such as (Bhutto) in Rwanda They were classified as black. Now, at that time Africans did not have the same racist outlook, right? And they were thinking about ethnic and tribal, However, these ideas have spread. This has allowed Europeans and Americans When they saw the great legacy of African civilizations, For example, when they looked at Great Zimbabwe or the pyramids, They said, \"It is clear that blacks cannot make these things. It must have been made by the garrison, right? These sophisticated old white invaders Who have been here for thousands of years. So this hypothesis has become a protector A way to explain and justify white colonialism, And all of these wonderful things that exist in Africa, It was robbed of the Africans themselves. There is a very dark side to the Hamitic hypothesis, It is this: Even after the Europeans left Africa in the 1960s And these countries became independent, And after it became clear that the hypothesis was garrison Absolutely incorrect, Even after this time The Africans themselves have embraced the Hamitic hypothesis As part of their history. For example, (Albatosi) in Rwanda They were considered to be of non-African descent, And other groups in Africa did the same. The (Irakawa) of Tanzania considered themselves to be of Mediterranean descent, Not African. And this ethnic conflict between the two groups He became a master in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. It was easier for the Hutus to see (Albatosi) as foreigners, As invaders to their non-African country, This made it easier for them to annihilate them. I am not saying that that was the only cause of the genocide in Rwanda, But it was one of the most important factors. This is the sad side of the story. But there is another side that I would like to end with, It is an exciting aspect of the story, Which is that we didn't ask the original question, If these things are not true, If Stanley hadn't seen white people in the heart of Africa? What did he see? So I went to Africa in 2013, And I actually climbed this mountain, which Stanley was looking at, Which I was not prepared for at all. I mean, I run, and I thought I was doing well, But the height of this mountain is 5,000 meters! There is a freezer on top, and I wasn't ready for that. But here I am before reaching this point. (Laughter) And as I told my mentor, I wanted to see what Stanley saw, But my mentor, who was from the Bakunzo tribe, looked at me And he said, \"There are no eggs on top of this mountain, man!\" (Laughter) And I said, \"I know there is none.\" But I want to think about what Stanley saw. You have reached a conditional hypothesis, and this hypothesis is: I think Stanley saw differences, I think he looked at people and said, \"These people are not like these.\" We now know that in terms of human diversity, Africa is the most diverse continent in the world. There is human diversity, that is to say physical diversity, in Africa More than anywhere else Because in Africa there is a long period of development For human races more than outside. So I think he saw differences between people, he thought - This is my own theory and I am very proud of it - Think about what I call Mr. Mago's hypothesis. (Laughter) So for those of you who are too young to remember Mr. Mago, It was similar to Don Quixote He was so shortsighted that you could put him in a room, He will not know his location, and thinks that he is somewhere else, Whenever he hit something in the room, Interpret this as if it were elsewhere Because his expectations about his whereabouts were very strong In a way that influenced understanding about it. I suspect that all explorers - and perhaps all tourists - Suffer from Mr. Mago's hypothesis, Where they describe everything they see Through their expectations of what it should be. And I think Stanley He wanted to see people like him, and Europeans like him. He was very lonely, having stayed in Africa for three years, Often without anyone from Europe or North America, And I think he wanted people like him And he saw this difference - in the bones of the face, the hooked nose, or the lighter complexion - And attributed this to white race. And finally, to finish, why should we remember this hypothesis? Well, it was a written test of how people viewed the world at the time. But I think we have to remember the hot hypothesis Because when we think of the main race and Aryan domination, We remember the very short violent period of Nazi Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, But in reality, there was a longer time and a deeper racial hypothesis It still exists today, and it is the protective hypothesis. Thank you very much. (clap)", "hs3OSjZg3Jo": "all right it's all the time okay now I'm in California so all these aren't crazy popular here but this has been the popular popular request people that are watching my videos so we're gonna do a little keto grocery haul here at Aldi now all he does have some clean options so it'll be interesting hopefully we can do a nice clean keto on a budget all about trying to save a couple bucks if we can get out of here for 150 bucks for a week that'd be awesome so that's gonna be the goal we'll see what happens let's head on in hopefully we don't get kicked out like we have a bad habit of having happen to us I've never seen that before you don't have a quarter do you they require you have to pay a quarter to get a cart alright so I'm not sure if I like this or appreciate it alright so first off I don't want to fall victim to things like this kale chips doesn't typically mean kale chips okay like this has kale in it but it's kale potato flour starch they're potato chips they just have kale in them so just be careful with things like that all the time all right whoa we're already off to a good start okay I don't know this brand but see a lot of people have been saying okay Aldi has really good keto options let's see a seven here wow this is actually really clean okay so we've got aged Parmesan cheese we've got cheese cultures salt and jalapeno that's actually pretty darn clean Parmesan crisp a little bit pricey 289 we still need some snacks now and then so let's go ahead and grab those just so we've got something don't wanna live on and whoa okay I see what people are saying about all these all right I might start doing a little shopping here we'll just see what we end up as far as budget goes all right peanuts although technically fit into a keto profile they're technically a legume not a nut so not the biggest fan of having them also a little bit higher carb content than I usually like six grams of carbs two grams of fiber not gonna hurt you if you're on a serious budget then yeah that'll work well but I'm gonna stay away from those what's these this comes this company's kind of cool let's see Wow okay we've got white sesame seeds a little bit of maltose not a big fan of that nori okay so you've got some good iodine you've got good thyroid support there it's actually really hard to get iodine outside of iodized salt iodized salt is garbage bleach it's not good but with this we get nori we get the seaweed in there we actually get a nice natural form of iodine so I am gonna get these I will say full disclaimer maltose is a carbohydrate they have it in there probably as probably a binder of some kind so again easy snack it's inexpensive it's a dollar ninety-nine and at least might get the family through the week a little bit if I get one or two of those I'm just going to get one for now so one of the lowest glycemic fruits that you can get is going to be a strawberry it does not mean that you have a bunch of them okay dr. ken berry who does a whole lot of stuff in the carnivore world he posted something on Instagram that I really like it said like a true carnivore diet no not keto but carnivore is good quality meat and a couple of berries okay so even the most devout keto people will still say that a couple of areas are okay when you're looking at fruits usually you want to have strawberries simply because they're gonna be the lowest glycemic blueberries are a close second to 95 for organic so that's pretty solid so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna I'm gonna roll these  okay fresh veggies are always nice when you're on a budget frozen really works well simply because frozen honestly its flash-frozen so you're preserving a lot of the nutrients so you're pretty solid there if you are gonna go fresh don't want to go super crazy on the spinach if you can't avoid the spinach it's a little bit higher in oxalates it's a little hard to digest though Wow what is that chirping close the oxalates basically they bind to minerals that are in your digestive tract so it can help bind the minerals and cause them to be excreted which can be battle maketo by it but not that big of a deal  none of these look really really good I think I will go ahead and I will get a little bit of our arugula it's probably one of the more nutrient-dense ones so I'll get this that way I'm not just getting low quality spring mix or romaine this is worth pointing out be careful of salad dressings that are in the refrigerated section because a lot of times they lead you to believe that they're really high-quality but in reality it's still canola oil so probably the lowest quality oil they could possibly use then we have a bunch of other things we got tapioca starts with carrageenan carrageenan is a thickener and a stabilizer the whole point of having it in the refrigerated section is that you don't need that stuff so they're still kind of like fluffing this up a little bit I understand from an economic standpoint why they do it but like so you're almost better off just getting the cheaper stuff at that rate it's the same stuff you're just paying more because you think it's high-quality in the refrigerated section no thanks  kombucha kombucha can be tricky okay seeing we still have a lot of carbs in kombucha six grams of carbs but servings per container - 12 grams of carbs you're a third of the way through your carb content for the day so just be careful there ah now we're talking this is the kind of stuff that I dig alright we've got good quality kimchi this is something like I could literally use this as a vegetable replacement like if I didn't want to load up with a bunch of fresh veggies I'd be down to just have this okay we've got really good quality cruciferous vegetables in there we've got bok choy we've got broccoli it looks like Brock sorry no broccoli in this one some of it has broccoli but we've got cabbage you got some bok Choy's all stuff that's gonna ferment kale and radish in there so the whole purpose of kimchi is you get this nice fermented effect so you get a good digestive component good probiotic effect and then the actual liquid itself you can use as a marinade like I marinate chicken in it I'm marinate broccoli and in all kinds of things it's a little bit pricey so it does hurt my budget but honestly it's worth it because I could replace it edges with this so let's go ahead and grab that so I did see some avocados over there but when you're on the go and you're feeding a family it's almost easier to just get guacamole this is a pretty good deal $2.99 for some good quality guacamole let's see what's in it Hass avocados tomatoes onions lime juice Wow actually good stuff compared to some of this yeah I don't want to get one that has black beans or anything like this is pretty awesome eighteen point seven cents per ounce versus twenty nine point nine cents per ounce this just wakes way more sense I'm gonna get this this is like good quality fats for the week this is gonna help me out all right okay here's something good to talk about  salami versus prosciutto okay salami is obviously a little bit higher fat content prosciutto is usually a little bit higher sodium content I like prosciutto because it's easier to keep it a little bit lean so if you want just cured meats or anything like that it's not the highest quality stuff in the world but I'd say it's better than salami so I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna get some prosciutto in this case not a bad price actually you know when I put that in the wrong spot let's see yeah 3:29 it's actually cheaper too so this is just good stuff on the go all right so I'm gonna grab some prosciutto all right we're in the cheese department now you've probably seen my video or maybe you haven't where I break down all the different kinds of cheeses it's time to get cheesy let's just get downright cheesy on this and cheeses that are good for you and stuff like that Jesus you should avoid on keto she's you shouldn't have on keto Jesus you can have on keto moderation I went into detail nice thing about all deep they have goat cheese readily accessible at a really good price that's a dollar ninety-nine for some plain old goat cheese or 239 frigging crumbles goat cheese is generally an a to casein protein which means it doesn't have what's called B C m7 and I'm not gonna go into exquisite detail but basically it doesn't have the casein aids that cause an opioid effect opioid reflux within your body so you don't get that addiction that you would get to normal cheese but also just much easier on the system so goat cheese whenever you possibly can the next best bet is going to be parmesan which honestly we can get some parmesan but it doesn't always work in the same methods that goat cheese would work the goat cheese works great on anything you can spread it on stuff you can't spread Parmesan cheese so I'm gonna get some goat cheese I'm just gonna get one thing of it because you don't need much Wow we ate all kinds of good quality fats here so we've got tzatziki so that's a Greek yogurt sort of it's a dip kind of thing you can use it with with cucumbers things like that really mild taste I like this because it doesn't have a ton of sodium so if you're looking for a dip that doesn have a bunch of sodium then fitzy he's gonna be nice so again I've got some good fats here but I don't want to just load up on random stuff so I think I'm gonna pass on this for the sake of being on a budget but good to go there feta is usually from sheep so if you get good quality feta you're gonna be in the same ballpark as you would be with goat cheese okay so higher sodium for sure they add a lot more salt to it to get it to culture and to do its thing so you can kind of pick you can go feta or you can go goat cheese some people like to taste the feta more than goat it's got that Tang eNOS whereas goat cheese has kind of a strange goat aftertaste let's see what else it got here now we are talking okay so smoked salmon wild caught salmon is always best but you don't usually find wild caught in a smoked form just because it usually is farmed in some ways this was raised in Norway which has different standards than the US ok so in the US has farm salmon it's a big issue Norway has pretty good standards I happen to know that Norway is actually really solved with that Atlantic salmon salt sodium lactate and beech wood smoked sodium lactate isn't a huge deal that still is for all intents and purposes pretty naturally derived this stuff is really good a really good quality fat obviously getting your nice omega-3 profile even though it's technically raised in Norway and it's technically probably farmed it's still gonna have a nice omega-3 omega-6 ratio so I'll go ahead and get that because that is a really good price I don't see any sausages or anything like that that would be good see this is the stuff I don't like any deli meat even the one that says they got the self healthy food awards we still into this look at this what you want to look at turkey breast then water means it's inflated but then it's got dextrose so it's basically it's basically becoming a starch sodium phosphate and brown and soybean oil and that's a healthy one so deli mean it's really tough does it really is ooh ahh man think of barbecues like this would be perfect it's the kind of thing like if you can just heat this heat and serve stuff and this is like they're super inexpensive area like they're discount section I see that this would be great if it didn't have the barbecue sauce actually sorry but holy moly that would take me like a year to read so I'm just gonna pass on that  let's see what they got in the way of some beef stuff okay you know me I'm always about grass-fed grass-finished beef but when we're on a budget we're probably not gonna be finding all of that especially at a store like oh oh yes okay cool we do have some bison that is not that cheap but it's a good price for bison okay we're talking $7.99 a pound is good that's like right in the world of Costco prices so bison is FDA regulated so it cannot be eating grain it has to be fed on pasture pasture raised is a way we want to go but also pasture finished and bison is going to have that so don't hate on me for spending 15 bucks or 16 bucks on getting a couple things a bison right now because this is really a little bit is gonna go a long way nice high fat content four servings of this is gonna be 200 almost 200 calories okay so we're in a really good shape there we don't even need much of it this will serve a you know throughout the week so I'm in a good spot there you know an interesting thing is is lamb and mutton not the biggest fan of eating those kinds of animals to be honest but it's pretty cool okay like usually the omega-3 profile for lamb is really really good I'm not gonna get this cuz I just generally don't like it that much but it's just something for you to know if you get lamb if you get mutton anything like that it's a really good fatty acid profile let's see what we got here ooh okay let's see  okay here's something okay 100% grass-fed ground beef it's not grass finished this is a big deal okay grass-fed is not grass minute it's not the same however Australia has different standards if it's Australian grass-fed that does mean that they finished on a pasture as well but what gets tough is it says product of Australia Uruguay and/or USA it makes it pretty darn difficult but we're on a budget guys we're not trying to I'm just trying to show you how you can eat as clean as possible while on a budget so I'm still gonna get a couple of you it's okay I'm human I don't always eat like absolutely 100% though well I think I won the prize I don't always eat exactly what I say you should be eating because you don't always run into the situations but you can get that kind of stuff so just being realistic here we are on a budget ground meat is always easier plus easier to masticate it's easier to digest easier to break down because you're not having to actively chew it as much it's plain and simple wild-caught alaskan salmon at $12.99 a pound that's really solid okay so Alaskan sockeye wild caught the deeper the red color that's not not pairing apples to apples or salmon to salmon but the deeper the red color you have a lot more in the way of just all kinds of different minerals okay so we do want the red one whenever possible again being on a budget I don't know if it makes sense to get this right now  being on a budget doesn't I don't know if it makes sense to get this right now especially since I got some smoked salmon and I don't know if I want to spend $17 of my budget on this but the fatty acid profile of pork is decent but you want the fatty acid profile of pork coming from mainly for things like bacon where it's the belly where it's more saturated fat and not the different polyunsaturated fats so none of these pork pieces are really of that much interest to me here's something to note when it comes to your ground foul your ground poultry or anything like that the fat that is in white meat is a really cruddy fatty acid profile so what I mean by that is if you're gonna go for a ground turkey or a ground chicken I know it doesn't taste as good but go with the leaner one the you don't want more fat coming from a white meat because it's lower quality fat you might as well get your fats from good clean sources and go with the leaner meat so in this case I'll get some of this ground ground turkey 93% it's pretty lean oh wait you know what we've got even better what's this 349 a pound I can still get organic 93 for $5.99 a pound I'm gonna get two of those and then I'll probably get one thing of chicken breast 649 a pound looking for a week here let me do a quick calculation get up bison one night with the family buy some another night with the family bolognaise one night I mean quite frankly like I'm set I'm set with me for the family now so that's pretty cool okay let's go ahead and let's head down some other areas here people think that you can't eat organic or you can't eat clean on a budget like honestly that is enough to feed a family of two maybe even a family of three actually that's going this way you know sauce is obviously on keto hit-and-miss I'm very very very wary of peanut butters because they're usually full of junk dry roasted peanuts sugar hydrogenated vegetable hydrogenated is a pure trans fat okay that's takes 51 days in the human body for a trans fat to break down the CIS and the trans bonds are different the body doesn't know how to break them down all the way this one's not bad I don't see any almond butter here or anything if I do come across it I'll grab one but 339 for organic peanut butter obviously getting some fats in getting our calories the nice thing about a ketogenic diet is you don't need nearly as much protein okay that's if you're new to my channel you may not know this but if you've watched my channel you know that the nice thing about the ketogenic diet is because the levels of ketones that are in your blood you maintain muscle really easily without ever having to have a lot of protein you can have more protein and it's not going to cause an issue certainly not but you can get by with having less and not lose muscle so this is really cool because you actually can do keto on a budget much easier than you would think simply because you don't have to eat the more expensive stuff like the meats all the time all right now we got some oh nice oh okay we are talking good stuff here good quality ghee okay so we've got look at that ingredient cow's milk fat that's all get makes it really really easy so I am gonna get some of this but mind you this is gonna last me a month so even if ever were to go over budget a little bit because of this bad boy it's not a huge deal definitely want some coconut oil again organic unrefined cold-pressed coconut oil we're in business there honestly it's gonna last me another couple weeks so I'm really really solid like even again I won't have to buy this but every other week so we could effectively count this as half of what it really costs cheedo is all about getting the healthy fats in okay now we get a nice you've got avocado oil and a nice my avocado oil really high smoke point so we can cook with it and doesn't denature normally fats will end up breaking down and if you have a fat like a polyunsaturated fat every time you cook with it it's gonna break down and some go through what's called lipid peroxidation which really can be toxic within the body okay okay it's by products that aren't just toxic in a like oh you're gonna get sick 20 years down the road sense but toxic in the way that you're actually going to be manipulating or changing how the fats are metabolized and that can be really really bad on your body and actually make it so you don't burn as much fat alright well now we got our pork rinds  [Applause] not the best quality pork rinds I'm always trying to find ones that are I mean it's still not bad not organic or anything but fried pork skins and salt that's all there is to it dollar 49 why not have the kiddos eat pork rinds instead of feeding them crackers right Steve yet one thing you do have to be careful who I'm not gonna get this one okay so we've got a rift all stevia and natural flavors I don't see regular straight-up stevia I don't have a big problem with stevia it's just that makes it tough I mean you've got this stuff so the bigger bags of stevia malted dextra and CBS soap although we don't have a rift at all in this one we have multi dextran so now we've got a pure starch that's gonna spike your insulin that makes it really tough okay I probably can't get my sweeteners here that's not a big deal well a little disheartening I'm not gonna get this because it's not an essential but $5.99 and we've got almond flour that's blanched and really finely ground those of you that think you can't cook on keto or bake your solid they're not a bad price yeah okay 29 cents for some tomato sauce getting this simply because I got some ground meat I like to make like a bolognaise I like to make sometimes get some spaghetti squash things like that so honestly if I get for these it's a great way to just add a little flavor without adding a bunch of just unnecessary stuff I'm not trying to be negative just so you guys know I just want to point things out we don't want to have cellulose added to prevent caking or potassium sorbate that's why it's better to just go fresh I know this stuff lasts longer and it's like a dollar cheaper but just get fresh it tastes better anyway mommy's spaghetti if you are deep in ketosis and you've been doing keto for a while get a little bit more flexibility as far as your carbs go with fiber although this is edamame and it's technically going to be soy it's not something you want to eat all the time this is kind of cool okay 20 grams of carbs 13 of which are from fiber if you are really craving a little bit of pasta a little bit of this would be okay guys people bag on the whole soy thing all the time soy is not good okay but at least organic soy you're not getting the GMOs you're not getting the crazy stuff that Monsanto is dealing with right if you have a small amount it can actually help out estrogen levels and balance it you just don't wanna have too much so this is something I wouldn't do more than I don't know maybe every other week but it's nice to have on hand and it doesn't go bad and it gives you a little bit of satiety and quite honestly it gives you the fiber that sometimes you end up missing out on a keto diet and obviously this is a grocery haul video it's my first time here well I miss some things absolutely but if I can teach you a little bit of stuff as I go then heck yeah okay I'm just trying to teach you a little bits and pieces as I go a common question is coconut water coconut water is not good on keto okay still a lot of sugar in that stuff 18 grams like a thirty nine in a whole thing that's basically a soda you could also just eat dog food it's usually pretty low carb so far this seems to be working alright one of my favorite things on keto is oysters mildly spicy  cod seed oil they put them in isn't the best and you can't usually find boys in water yeah at cottonseed oil just give them a good bath it's not when I say give my bath just rinse them it's not something that I would highly recommend all the time just so you know but I am a sucker for smoked oysters and they are a great way to just get some good quality fats in there's a lot of recent science coming out saying that clams oysters mussels anything like that is actually really really really solid and one of the best amino acid profiles that you can find here's some interesting things so when you get sardines at like a discount store sardines are like one of the highest omega-3 content fish that you can possibly find very inexpensive the hard part is almost always when they're in oil they're going to be in soybean oil which is just not good so I try to get them in water whenever possible but a lot of times you can find ones that are in like mustard this one's got mustard flour which is just mustard acetic acid that's literally just vinegar it's got the cornstarch and the turmeric color and xantham you smell a bunch of other stuff which I don't like let's see if we got here I would hate to say it but like when you look at the ingredients soybean oil sucks okay it's not good try to get it in water but if you're limited with your selection people will say oh I'll get it in the mustard sauce it's less fat guys we've got the xanthan gum we've got modified cornstarch we've got all these other colorings compared to that when in doubt less ingredients is gonna be better so I'm gonna get a couple things with sardines I'm gonna get them in the oil and I'm gonna make sure I wash them really thoroughly and then I've also got my oysters my wife makes me eat the oysters outside if I eat them she says go outside because she doesn't like the smell of them she thinks they're horribly disgusting and a lot of people do if you agree you can comment down below whatever so I have to eat them outside so I call it my smoke break because it's my smoked oysters break um let's see we got in the way of tuna okay so I've talked about this in other videos too we got chunk light tuna in oil or sorry we want to get this in water if we did chunk light in water versus solid white tuna in water both in water which one's gonna be better most people are gonna look at this and say oh protein content in the albacore is better the mercury content and the toxic effect of what is in albacore is significantly worse than chunk light chunk light is a smaller tuna albacore it's bigger it's gonna also more dense so if you're gonna go with the tuna go with the go with the actual chunk light it's really not that bad the other thing you can do is you can go with skip Jack and skip Jack is really good it was much more sustainably caught so I'm gonna go and I'm gonna grab some skip Jack this is perfect so now I've got lunch food I mean I've got my dinner I've got my lunch if I want to make a tuna salad I may need to find some mayonnaise I might have walked past it earlier but I mean that's a pretty good stuff there it's this big ol start easy this would be cool if it didn't have the sugar I just saw some finger than starting this day it's an interesting store all right so eggs can be sketchy I love my eggs but it's hard to get good quality ones try to get eggs honestly locally that's gonna be the best bet with eggs but again I get it you're on a budget kind of brings up the question like what's better free-range or organic free-range if not organic doesn't mean much of anything okay it just means that they're out on a range and they still feed them the same garbage right at least with organic they might be in a cage but at least the grain and the soy and the stuff that they're feeding them is organic so when you're trying to figure out between free-range or organic go for organic okay now if you ever can you want to have organic free-range that's obviously the best but I don't even see that option here so I was putting a little bit of a corner I'm just going to get this now I don't need a whole lot of eggs why because I'm just using the eggs for the fat I'm just using the Oaks yolks for the most part almond milk I definitely wanna get hmm again if you have an option between coconut milk and almond milk this is original see they have coconut milk but you have to be very careful original has sugar okay very careful there you have to find the coconut milk or almond milk you have to find ones that say unsweetened see how easy it is to miss that and chances are you've had this before and you've just have been like oh it tastes extra good today but you probably cut the sweetened one by mistake so I'm gonna get one of this organic vanilla unsweetened just get a little bit more of a flavor it tastes closer to the old I don't mind a little bit of an Olaf layer it's not gonna tell you it's not Kerrygold brand but all right what do we got I'm a big Greek yogurt guy looks like the Greek yogurt selection is not too great if I'm gonna get Greek yogurt I'm gonna get like a 2% I'm not gonna get a fat free fat free is much more likely to have other things in it to increase the taste and dairy fat to a small degree it's actually okay okay so hepcidin Noack acid is actually an okay fat that's and then also hep is Noah canned then also there's one other one trans palmitoleic those are dairy fats that have been sown in studies to actually help out overall with lifespan and help out reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and things like that so really not a bad thing but I don't see any 2% or any that's let me see here  that's okay I might be able to live without the Greek yogurt this time I'm gonna go some cottage cheese let's see if they got here  ouch this isn't even guys isn't supposed to be like an active pitch for a product at all but this is the kind of thing I did a cottage cheese video this is the kind of thing I'm talking about when you go to the grocery store this is what you normally see when you see cottage cheese like if you look at it and this isn't again just a pitch for good culture but if you look at like good culture cottage cheese I'll have the video team make sure they show a clip of what the ingredient profile looks that's what cottage cheese should look like looks not like this I can't even know is anthem gum carrageenan carob bean gum citric acid carbon dioxide potassium sorbate cottage cheese is hard to stabilize so anyone that does it right it's worth getting I can't even honestly recommend getting that it's a little bit of a bummer all right bacon all right I was never that big of a bacon fan and then you know what nine years ago or so when I started keto i just started loving it so the fat that comes from bacon is coming from the belly fat of the pig which is much more saturated so you get the saturated fats are like stearic acid and the more stabilized fats so I'm okay with getting those kind of fats whereas the fatty acid profile from the rest of the bacon isn't as good turkey bacon it's okay it's not bad okay you're just gonna get a better fatty acid profile from pork bacon now when I'm looking here I'm not seeing a whole lot of good quality regular bacon now this is cool okay interesting stuff to note so when you're looking at labels again you want to see things that say never any because the FDA allows food companies and neat packaging to say no hormones no antibiotics they're allowed to say that and they can still give them antibiotics it just is within a certain timeframe of when they go to harvest so that pig could have had antibiotics in it six months ago but it was outside of the time frame the FDA requires him to mention it never any antibiotics hormones okay these are kind of a double negative here never any vegetarian diet anyway I'm gonna get this this is this is not bad a little bit of salt and a little sugar which is gonna happen with Hickory bacon the good news this is once you cook it the sugar burns off not the best stuff in the world but the work is the danger zone in to the danger zone oh I like my Tejada that's just for fun all right no here's something you guys need to know cauliflower pizza crusts are not usually what they say okay they're playing on the ignorance sometimes so this says a cauliflower crust first of all whoa that's a lot more than just a cauliflower crust okay so we've got water cauliflower powder rice flour Beach okay so it's mainly look a bit come on 69 grams of carbs so that's not exactly cauliflower crust oh yeah wild cut Oh get this dip okay so remember how I said I didn't want to get salmon because I didn't want to spend $17  $3.99 so wild-caught pink salmon okay wild Todd I'm getting us for $3.99 that's insane we achieve so again pros in especially with fish is really good because frozen it's usually frozen right after they catch it they catch it and they put it in a freezer on the boat so you're retaining as much as you possibly can wear sometimes fresh he's actually less quality than frozen I'm gonna get two of these and again factor in that this very well should last me a couple of weeks we got some burgers and stuff too that's kind of cool I guess the kind of thing like could feed your kiddo like he loves like burger patty things like that if that had is a good ingredient profile I'm gonna save the time today and not go through it tilapia if we'd like the plague it's a rice flour raw cauliflower garlic and herb soothe than that nice so even this one rice cauliflower and garlic and herb I was expecting a bunch of weird stuff in it no we got free coach cauliflower and we've got garlic and we got parsley okay who says that you can't make a good healthy dinner for your kids and your family on keto like that it has them covered in cheese like I could take this I could cook up some bacon chop it up into small pieces mix it into the rice cauliflower and then have a salmon patty on top of that with some coconut oil in the cauliflower rice to make it a little bit smoother and like I've got a really good eco hole like that's a really good healthy solid you know that people are gonna like so let's get a couple of those actually I'll probably get one more just so you get the realism of the budget veggies are actually great to get frozen I mentioned it earlier but they're flash frozen so every time you have harvest a vegetable and it goes onto the truck its oxidizing okay its oxidizing and it's the nature and wallets on the truck at least it's frozen right at the peak of harvest in this case so  beans broccoli clerks and these I  thought you're getting kicked up okay so with these you can steam them in the bag these are supposed to be BPA free bags so you probably okay probably take them out and see them separately though to be honest I thought for sure we were gonna get kicked out of that point lady came walking over we have a bad habit of getting kicked out of grocery stores and we do this and she was walking towards us and I was like up here it comes and then nope she's helping a customer with beyond me nice yeah so halo top something it's technically not keto friendly but it's close enough if you if you wanted to treat I mean it's full of junk but honestly I like what they're at least doing so I'm not gonna get any today that's that's not bad it's nice it only has at least like honestly that's not something you can find in a lot of normal grocery stores enlighten same kind of thing  okay that's not again here's another one of those things that can get tricky right okay so ingredients cauliflower corn because they've got all the corn up here like if you want to just eat plain rice cauliflower this would work but it's kind of weird just cuz this is on sale this is the kind of thing I mean 450 for this I've got almonds rosemary almonds chai spiced almonds roasted salted deluxe mixed nuts that's not bad for twenty four point three cents per ounce and I get like a nice little variety the chai spice haven't got sugar let's see ooh yeah not worth it in a month always always check double check so I'm trying to find coconut cream because I like to use it as a creamer I'm not seeing it  it's kind of a bummer so in that case you might want to sub that out for maybe a little bit of heavy cream or a little um don't get half and half try to use heavy cream just because half and a half has way much weight a lot more milk sugar because it's half nil cap cream so I might go grab I think a heavy cream I'll totally maybe I missed them earlier  alright I am going to get some peanuts because they didn't have any almonds or anything here so again just go easy on the peanuts yeah at least these are just just peanuts that's all that's in it but actually this one might have salt yeah I'm okay with salt I mean remember on keto what's happening is your kidneys expelling a lot of water because you have so much in the way or so little in the way of insulin it's a natural response for your kidneys to flush water so your electrolytes your potassium your sodium everything leaves so it's okay with that all right actually I take that back they were right in front of me all along  they just have them on an end cap let's see what they got all right cashews technically a fruit they're expensive they're sweet and they're not the best keto on for what they've got here almonds aren't gonna always be the best either because of the phytic acid I always find I'll get really bloated when I have that although this has some cashews in it the fact that it has walnuts and macadamia sand it's kind of nice probably go with this one so I can at least you know avoid the cashews a little bit and have some more in the way of pecans couldn't start walnuts walnuts are the highest omega-3 fat nut that you're gonna find mustachios are awesome but they're also the highest carb yeah 9 grams of carbs I love them but alright let's go with these guys and try to just buy one bag so I don't go overboard baking cocoa okay just a hundred percent cocoa again not organic in this case though it's a dollar 95 I'll mix this with almond milk add a little and stevia and make a delicious little treat that I can sip on perfect thing to have before bed just hanging out after having some dinner or watching a little bit TV with the family it's a great little thing to have so cocoa is awesome don't think that all has to have sugar in it just get it from the baking aisle and if they were to have actual cocoa like chocolate chocolate bars like baking chocolate I would have grabbed some of that too okay I'm just gonna grab some heavy cream and we'll be out of here  heavy whipping cream okay again the dairy fat is not that bad it's not the fat from the dairy that I have a problem with it's the caissons and the milk sugars what you're going to get out of half-and-half you're better off to use a little less heavy cream than you are to use twice as much half-and-half especially in your coffee alright so I got this guy I think I'm good to go [Applause]  my goal was 150 bucks I nailed it yes seriously I love that show seriously yeah oh let's go yeah uh I grew up in Sonoma us up near Santa Rosa where guys from and all that so it's awesome yeah very cool Thank You YouTube oh my god that was so refreshing we were welcomed with open arms at a grocery store with a camera one thing I did forget about Aldi is that they don't offer you bags or boxes so now I just stuff these in my truck that's all right 148 I made it alright and I also got things that are going to be good for a couple a couple of weeks so I'm pretty stoked I'm pretty stoked that I nailed that and we got good quality grass-fed grass-finished meat we got organic meats like who says you can't eat clean on a budget this would easily feed a family of three possibly even four if you're on keto and most of your calories are coming from highly calorically dense foods like there's no reason that you have to just settle for garbage you can eat clean and you can shop at a place like Aldi which is pretty much a discount grocer so I'm happy with what I got this will honestly carry into the next week sure there's gonna be overlap some of you might argue old you need more of this than that guys like there's a grocery haul video give me a little bit of a break but I think this lays it out pretty darn nicely and all these rocks because they didn't kick me out  no this video is not sponsored by GMC I still can't believe they had some of this stuff like wild caught salmon thanks for $3.99 like that's insane as so insanely cool I should have stocked up on that my bison like for the same price as Costco like it means a Costco membership if you can get bison here just by the way if you guys want to see a Costco grocery haul video let me know down in the comment section hey you get your quarterback it's just a deposit I can go get a gum ball now alright I'm still proud over the fact that I pretty much guess the price almost exactly and I don't know maybe I need to go in the prices right wanted to be making youtube videos anymore but I win big and win the Buick so once again kind of summarize this wasn't perfect right the idea this was getting clean food for Kido to prove that it can be done and just to teach you how to shop clean at a discount grocery store I mean I didn't want at Walmart if you haven't seen that one already we'll put it down below in the description so you can check that one out I've done I've done some stuff at Trader Joe's I want to do more at Trader Joe's I've done a smart and final one where we got kicked out but that was just like a quick a quick hit just a few things I'd love to do more grocery haul videos if you want to see them but my series is always going to be about clean keto it's always gonna be about how do we get the right things for the right price and not sacrifice our health for a buck because no matter where you go you can make pretty healthy choices if you are just armed with the right knowledge and everything in life is a given to take it's all relative you know if it if you're gonna spend less money at a discount grocery store then you're gonna have to spend more time educating yourself on what to get so it's all a balancing act and that's what I'm here to help you up I'm here to show you the ropes and show you what you can learn and how you can ultimately save money so that your family can eat healthy so as always please keep it locked in here on my channel and if you want more of these videos and you need you to comment down below and see what kind of grocery store you want me to go to I'm happy to fly to a different part of the country to really do one of the different grocery store I don't have Kroger's in the West Coast and I'll fly somewhere to do a program anyhow thank you all very much see you soon [Music]", "aI6bPspVOmU": "", "LIYNuCw98r0": "", "kcR3FMS9kNU": "my name is dr. Jacob Wilson I'm on the scientific advisory board of Dymatize nutrition and I also have a laboratory at the University of Tampa where we specialize and building muscle as well as bodybuilding and how to lose fat and get shredded I'm a scientist but Gavin I absolutely love bowling I love lifting weights so ever since I was probably five or six I knew I won to be a scientist and I knew I wanted to be specialized in sport to study how to get there how to get shred at the same time basically the sport of bodybuilding itself the thing about body bowling is this it's such an interesting sport because basically to gain size and to be shred at the same time they don't mix right so this is to me it's it's fascinating it's the ultimate dichotomy you know here we are today and we have a body villain laboratory University of Tampa we're doing work with Dymatize nutrition and as we speak we're doing around six experiments on bodybuilding we can look at muscle from the bone to the skin we can scan your whole body and tell you the most accurate ways to look at fat you name it we can actually look at it I want to bring the sport to a new level with the latest that science has to offer  basically if you look at all the scientific literature out there we've narrowed down how muscle grows to at least three to four different mechanisms and the thing is with training everyone's like oh this is the best training method oh this is the best training method but that training method might only maximize one of those mechanisms so we want to do is hit each of these mechanisms and what those are this you know when guys go to the gym and they're like oh I'm going to get my swole on right well there's actually something to that we call it the self swelling theory so when you train and you get a pump kind of like Arnold talked about he was right it actually your cells your muscle cells themselves sense that swelling as a threat and they're basically saying okay I have to grow or die so they restructure themselves and get larger so you have to target well what are the methods to increase that short rest period lengths seem to increase that edema or that blood to the muscle eight to twelve repetitions supersets those are ideal on top of that is recruiting or calling into play the larger muscle fibers for those of you guys who know muscle fibers you know we have our slow twitch muscle fibers which are good for endurance and then we have the large fast twitch muscle fibers those are recruited with the heavier type of lifting right like six to eight repetitions very heavy and when you recruit them they turn on protein synthesis and you grow so that's the second thing and then the third thing is mechanical trauma like damage to the tissue and where that occurs essentially is when you're lowering a weight and again heavy lifting so basically what you want to do in your training is you want to period eyes your training so you're optimizing each of these mechanisms and there's so many different techniques that you can use one theory that I haven't talked about yet is called metabolic stress now everyone knows you know when you get that burning sensation when you're training well that's acidity building up to the muscle that's lactic acid building up in the muscle well one of my friends dr. gundermen did was he took muscle cells and isolated them he put lactic acid and basically they grew so muscles actually grow that burning sensation will actually make them grow so for example if you go to the gym and you rest like five minutes and you're talking about what you did on the weekend that clears all out that metabolic stress so you won't grow so bodybuilders traditionally will have you know they'll train with a eight to 12 rep ranging they're only wrestling like sixty Seconds sometimes they're doing super sets and strip sets so to build up metabolic stress and cell swallowing your nav short rest periods but let's say you want to optimize mechanical stress that's going to be heavier lifting and to do that if you're lifting with short rest periods you can't lift this heavy so the mechanical stress is less so during your heavy days you should actually rest 3 to 5 min and realize that you're going to maximize the mechanical load you're trying to lift as heavy as you can now that repetition range it might still be you know eight repetitions six repetitions so it's still in a higher repetition range I'm not talking about powerlifting but you're resting longer so that each time you let the weights are heavy the biggest mistake I think people make in the gym is they underestimate what their capabilities actually are so they limit themselves first mentally and that leads to limiting themselves physically so for example everyone's always we're like oh my god you know I'm going to over train so I can only train everything once a week but studies are showing that the more frequent you train the better your gains will be so sometimes when you have an overload on the muscle every day your performance is not going to be best but you're beating the muscle up so much that it basically has no choice but to grow so you're going to have to expose your muscles to a lot of stress and there's new studies that are coming out by some of my colleagues in Finland and Norway where they're showing really good weight lifters are gaining hypertrophy from going from three days a week to training to six days a week of training per body part now I'm not saying that everyone to do that that's an advanced technique what I am saying is don't limit yourself the human body can withstand a lot more you can think so long as your nutrition and your sleep are in place  as far as mass and optimizing the most anabolism the compound movements are always going to be the center you know of a bodybuilding program that's going to be things like squats it's going to be things like bench press is going to be things like leg press but there's a difference between bodybuilding and powerlifting if you look bodybuilding is about making the exercise harder you're trying to beat your muscles up so if you're doing a bench press and your body bowing your back might be flat you're focusing on the muscle you're focusing on every aspect of the lift if you're a power lifter you're going to get an arching your back you're short in the range of motion you're going to have leg Drive same thing with squatting you're going to use your belt to get you get the weight up but in bodybuilding you're focusing on destroying the muscle so the compound movement are so critical but your intent should be to focus on those muscles and to destroy them it's a lot different in that sense now once those compound movements are in place body bone is also a sport of symmetry so you're going to have to focus then on the isolation movements but it obviously someone's going to have a huge gap if all they do is isolation movements and they're not doing the compound one of the things about body mile is this if you're going to shock the muscle to grow we know we need change okay so changing the exercise is actually absolutely one of the best ways you can do that so using non-traditional lifting type of techniques absolutely Canali shock your muscles to grow but also translate certainly into you know functionality you know in our normal society as well  so one of the dichotomies was bodybuilding is that you have to gain size and you got to lose fat at the same time so to gain size you lift weights to lose fat you do cardio and sometimes bodybuilders do two hours of cardio a day but look at a marathon runner I mean is that something that a bodybuilder aspires to be but clearly what we found in our laboratory is that the longer you do cardio the more muscle you lose so basically you're spending all this time in the offseason gaining muscle and you're losing a lot of it with long duration cardio so what our laboratory is done is try and figure out how to solve this problem and one of the things that we've done is high-intensity interval training when I say high-intensity interval training I'm talking about 10 to 30 seconds of all-out balls-to-the-wall kill yourself nauseated sprinting when I say 10 seconds you should have nothing left at the end of that 10 seconds when I say 30 seconds you should feel like you're going to die when you do that type of cardio what happens is what we found is essentially literally in 10 seconds time you can deplete your muscle energy stores by like 15% and that might take like 60 minutes with traditional cardio what that does is it sent a massive signal to your body and says oh my god I have to increase my fat burning machinery and when you do that you're burning fat the rest of the day so we've actually found that with ten to thirty second all-out Sprint's that you're actually losing more fat than with a long duration 30 to 60 minute cardio and yet you actually maintain your size in fact we did a study in our lab where we've compared low intensity cardio to high intensity cardio now they lose more fat but they gain muscle in their quads so the actual sprinting can be somewhat anabolic  the best way to avoid injury in a gym is the period Iser training if someone responds really well the heavy training and all they do every single time is let five reps one two five repetitions every time they go to the gym four six eight reps every time they rest long rest period lengths they're constantly loading the muscle and that's where it takes us to on your joints you know ligaments you feel the strain you get an injury and guide injuries are the worst thing to the bodybuilder because it takes them months to recover you know if you're out for a month you lose muscle and that takes you a month to recover you just lost two months periodization is programmed change one day a week you might train traditional hypertrophy training was going to be eight to twelve repetitions 3060 seconds rest one day you might train heavy like in a six to eight repetition range then if you're filling your joints are a little bit hurt there's a new technique what's known as blood flow restriction training and this technique what happens is if you restrict blood flow to a limb you only have to lift it like thirty to forty percent of your maximal weight and you actually can grow focus on the goals so if you're trying to focus on conditioning and primarily muscle hypertrophy or growth maybe two out of your four workouts are going to be traditional hypertrophy the next day is more of a hypertrophy superset type of day the next day is a heavy day and then maybe throw in a blood flow restriction day and then you start over so now your joints are getting certain rest periods and you recover  basically when you talk about training we're fighting on it's like any other sport you have to master your trade get everything you can out of every single lift if you're doing a set of twelve every single rep should count we know with studies when people are focusing on the muscle they activate more of it so going through the motions is going to get you those types of results right so it's focusing make everything count make every meal count make your sleep count make every repetition count make every set count be meticulous write down how you felt in the gym write down what you think you're going to be and where you're going to be and set goals that are attainable what I want is this there's so much misconceptions out there are so many mess out there I want people to be educated so for more videos and content like this keep coming back to body muncom I guarantee we're going to have the latest that science has to offer on this sport", "IRVdiHu1VCc": "Translator: Mirah AlFalasi Auditor: Mahmoud Aghiorly Dirty job crew and I'm called up To a small town in Colorado, called Craig. It is only a few dozen square miles away, it is in the Rocky Mountains. The work was on the question of a sheep farm. And my role in the show is for those of you who haven't seen it - it's rather simple. I am a beginner, and I work with people who don't actually have a job. My responsibilities are just keeping up And make a friendship account of what it's like to have these people, For a day in their life. We work for those who ask us for it - like sheep grazing. .. Great. We go to Greg and stay in a hotel I realize the next day that castration It will be an important part of this business so. Usually, I don't do any research at all. However, this is a sensitive topic, and I work for Discovery Channel, And we want to accurately depict everything we do, And we definitely want to do that with a lot of respect for the animals. Therefore, the Humane Society called the animal And I say \"Look, I\\'m going to castrate some lambs, Can you tell me the deal? \" And they said \"Yes, it\\'s simple and clear.\" It's a straightforward method - they mainly use the elastic band, like this one, but a little bit smaller. That's actually one about playing cards I got yesterday, And there was some kind of familiarity. And I said, \"Well, what exactly is the process?\" And they said: \"Tape it tightly to the tail. And then another tape is applied tightly to the scrotum. The blood flows slowly and slowly, After a week, the said members will be cut off. \" \"Great! I got it.\" Well, I'm going to call the SPCA to confirm this - they confirm that. I also called PETA just for fun and they don't like it, but they confirm that. Well, that's basically how we do it. On the second day she went out. And I was given a horse to go get lambs And we take them to the barn that we built, We are moving in the business of animal husbandry. Melanie is Albert's wife. Albert is the shepherd. Melanie picks up the lamb - with her hands - One hand on both legs is right, and likewise on the left. The lamb goes on to the mail, and opens it. OK. Great. Albert goes, and I follow Albert, and the crew around me. I always watch the process of doing it the first time before I try to do it. Be a trainee, you know, you do. Albert puts his hand in his pocket to pull, you know, to show the black rubber band But what came out was a knife instead. And I said this is not a rubber band, you know. He had pounced it and opened it in the way that the sun caught That was just coming from Rocky Mountain - was - It was awesome. In space in about two seconds, Albert was holding the knife Between the cartilage of the tail, next to the background of the tail, Very quickly the tail went and was in the bucket that caught it. In a second thumb and big index finger hardened well, He had a scrotum, holding it firmly in his fist, And pull it towards it, and then, Take the knife and put it on a tip. Now you think you know what will happen, Michael, you don't know? Okay. He grabs it, he puts it to the tip of his shoulder, Then he grabs the scrotum and pushes it up, Then his head drops to the top, ignoring my view, And what I hear is the sound of slurping, The noise that appears to have been snatched from a sticky wall is being extracted And I'm not even joking. Can we play the video? No, I'm joking-- we can't-- Laughter I think it is better to talk through pictures. So, I'm doing something I've never done anything about filming dirty jobs, ever. I say, \"Time out. Stop.\" You guys know the show, and we use the first shot, and we don't use the second shot. No writing, no programming, no nonsense. We do not fool around, do not train, We shoot and succeed in photography! I told him: \"Stop this madness. I mean, you know - Laughter This is crazy. We cannot do this. And Albert said, \"Why?\" And I said, \"I don\\'t know what just happened, But there are members of this bucket, and this is not the way we should do it. \" And he said, \"Well, that\\'s how we do it.\" And I said, \"Why do you do it this way?\" Please let me explain before, I said, \"I want to do it the right way, with rubber.\" He says, \"Like the Humane Society?\" And I said, \"Yes, like the Humane Society. Let's do something that doesn't make pregnancy bleed - We are on five continents, my friend. Today we appear twice on Discovery Channel - we cannot do this. \" And he says, \"Okay.\" He goes to the box and pulls a bag of little rubber bands. Melanie picks up another load, puts it on the table, The rubber band will be on the tail, and the second strap will be on the scrotum. The lamb falls on the ground, and the pregnancy takes two steps, falls, Wake up, shake a little, He takes other steps, and falls again. I said, and this is not a good sign for this pregnancy at all. He wakes up, walks to the corner and trembles It falls from fatigue. And I look at pregnancy and say, \"Albert, for how long? When will he wake up?\" When will he wake up? \" And he said, \"In a day.\" I said, \"One day! How long will it take to happen?\" \"In a week.\" Meanwhile, the pregnancy had to do the little procedure He, you know, is jumping, the bleeding has stopped. He bites the grass, dances with joy. It flew away How wrong I was, in that second. And I remembered how wrong I was, quite often. Laughter I mentioned in particular that what is ridiculous is me on that day Because I had to do what Albert did And there are like 100 of these lambs in the barn, And suddenly everything started to sound like German porn, And I am amazed Melanie picks up the load, You put it on the table, and you open it. Albert D gave me the knife. Enter and the tail comes out. And I enter again, and grab the scrotum, he starts glimpsing me Albert instructs, \"Push it up.\" I do. \"I pay more for that.\" I do. Members are starting to appear and they look like thumbs, coming towards you. He says, \"Bite him. Just bite it. \" I heard it, and heard all the words. Laughter Like, how-- how did you get here? How do you-- you know-- I mean-- How did you get here? Laughter It's just-- it's one of those moments when the brain explodes on its own Suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rocky Mountains, All I can think of is Aristotle's definition of tragedy. As you know, Aristotle says tragedy The moment the hero comes face to face with his own identity. Laughter And I said, \"What is this compound analogy? I don\\'t like what I\\'m thinking about right now. \" And I can't get this thought out of my head, And I can't forget the scene and take it out of my sight, And I did what I had to do. I went and took them. I took them like this, And I grabbed my face again. And I'm standing there The testes are on my chin Laughter And now I can't get it - I can't shake the metaphor. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still poetic in Aristotle, I was thinking - suddenly, two phrases come crashing into my head I have not heard these phrases since I was studying with my classical teacher and he was digging them in my head. They are anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis and peripeteia. It is a word of Greek anagnorisis Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge anagnorisis What our network does, Are dirty jobs. I even neck my neck I live in anagnorises every single day. Great. The other word is, peripeteia And this is a moment in the big tragedies, you know - Euripides and Sophocles - The moment that Oedipus was his moment, Where he suddenly realized that chick He slept with the children with his mother. OK. This is peripety And peripeteia. And this analogy in my head - Anagnorisis and peripetia got my chin up. Laughter I have to tell you, this device is great. When you begin to search for Peripetia You find it everywhere. I mean, Bruce Willis in \"Sixth Sense,\" right? The movie goes on all the way to help the little boy who sees dead people And then Boom --- oh, I'm dead - peripetia. You know? He will shock the audience if he knows him the right way. New to Matrix, you know? Oh, I live on a computer program - and that's weird. These discoveries lead to sudden realization. And they had more than 200 dirty jobs, and they were with me the whole time, But these - and these discoveries took me away and I was not ready for them. And as I stood there, I look happily at the pregnancy I just desecrated-- But it looked okay. Looking at the little poor thing that you did that right, But I was shocked If I am wrong about that Whether I'm mistaken often, literally, What other misconceptions will I be able to comment on? Now look, I'm not a scientist in social anthropology But I have a friend who works in this field. And I'm talking to him. Laughter He says, \"Mike. See I don't know if your brain is interested in this type of thing or not, Do you realize I have filmed scenes in every country? I used to work in mining, I worked in fishing, She has worked steel and has worked in all major industries. You stand side by side with these guys We have that politicians have been unable to do even once every four years, right? \" I can still see Hillary doing the rye shots Dodging down her chin, with steel workers. I mean, these are the people that I work with every day. And if you have something to say about their ideas, and collectively, It may be time to think about it. Because, group, you know, four years. You know, that in my head, the members are on my chin, And thoughts revolve After filming, the dirty jobs didn't change, In terms of supply, But it has changed for me, personally. And now, when I talk about the show, And I'm no longer just a novel that I've heard 190 times. But I also start to talk about some other things that I misunderstood, And some other concepts from work That you just did on a sacred assumption, And no longer. People with dirty tasks are happier than you think. As a group, they are the happiest people I know. And I don\\'t want to start minimizing, \"Look for the union label,\" And all crap happy worker. I tell you that these people whose work is balanced you cannot imagine. Roadkill pickers-uppers whistle while they work, I swear to God, I worked with them. They've got this kind of amazing symmetry for their lives. And I see that again and again. So I started to wonder what would happen If we challenge some in these cows. Follow your passion - We have been talking about it here for the past 36 hours. Follow your passion - what could possibly be wrong with that? Probably the worst advice I ever got. Laughter You know, follow and fulfill your dreams, don't you? I mean, that's all I heard when they grew up. I didn't know what to do with my life, But I was told if you follow your passion, it will work. And I can give you 30 examples, right now-- Bob Combs, the pig breeder in Las Vegas That collects leftovers from casinos And give it to the pigs. Why? Because there is so much protein in things that we don't eat And pigs grow twice as fast as normal, He is a rich pig breeder, And it's good for the environment, He spends his days doing incredible services, It smells bad, but the Lord keeps it safe. It is a great livelihood. Ask him, \"Were you following your passion here?\" I will laugh at you. The man deserves - he got a roughly $ 60 million offer for his farm The offer was rejected .. It was outside Las Vegas He did not follow his affection. Stop .. and watch the show owners come out in front of it Then complete his path on the opposite path I hear this story over and over again. Furend, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, died. Who woke up one day and realized that it was his cows Deserves more than her milk, If it can be used to make these pots of biodegradable flowers Now he sold it to Wal-Mart. Follow his passion - men - come on. I started to look with a look of passion, And I began to see competence versus potency, As Tim talked about earlier, this is the big difference. I started to look at teamwork and design, And basically all these trivialities are called success Who hang out with art of Northsea administration around the world right now. those things -- Suddenly it turned upside down. Safety - Safety first It is that I will return to you, you know, the Safety and Health and Beta, and the Humane Society. What if the Safety and Health Organization is wrong? I mean, this is a novelty, what I'm about to say, But what if safety really came in third place, not first? Is this appropriate? Laughter No, I mean really. What I mean by saying is that my safety has more value about these crazy jobs As much as the people I work with, But they are the ones who are doing it the right way, They are not there to talk about safety first And they know that other things come first-- The completion of the project comes first, Do and complete the project. And I will not forget, in the Bering Sea, on a crab boat With bloody hunting players, which I work in season one. We are about 100 kilometers off the coast of Russia And 50 feet for the seas, big waves, and green water coming into the wheelhouse, right? This is one of the greatest dangerous environments I've ever seen, I came back with the man, and I flew these fish So, when I'm 40 feet above deck, Which is like looking at the top of the shoe, You know, he does that in the ocean. Seriously not mentioned. I'm going down, I'm going to the wheelhouse And I say, with a degree of skepticism, Captain, Safety and Health Organization. And he says, \"Safety and Health? - The Ocean.\" He points out there Laughter But at that moment, what he said could not be repeated in the lower part of 48. It cannot be repeated in that factory or any construction site. But he looked at me, and he said \"Japanese - He's my age, by the way, calling me my son, and I like that-- As he says, \"Son, I\\'m the captain of a fishing boat. My responsibility is to bring you home while you are alive. It is my responsibility to return to the home with more wealth. \" Laughter You want to get home alive, it's up to you. For the rest of that day, safety comes first. I like -- The idea that we create this lie - This is a feeling of contentment When we talk about someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility And being our responsibility, and vice versa. However, in a lot of things. I can talk at length about the few differences we made On ourselves and an endless list of ways that we mistakenly understood But what is the purpose of all this Have a theory, and I will share with you now In the remaining thirty minutes and thirty seconds. And this is what happens - I have declared war on business, As a community, for all of us. It is a civil war. It is the cold war. Really. We haven't started doing that We have not wrapped our drinkers in the Machiavellian way, But we did. This war was waged on at least four fronts, And definitely in Hollywood. The way we portray the working people on TV, It's funny. If there is a plumber .. he weighs 300 pounds .. and he talks a lot of bad words .. to admit this We see it all the time. This is what plumbers look like, isn't it? We turn them into heroes, or we take them to the platform This is what TV does. We are trying hard that dirty jobs are not, This is the first reason I am doing this and I am not cheating. This war was waged on Madison Street. I mean, a lot of commercials that come from there - On the path to a message, what is really said? Your life would be better if you had worked a little less If you don't have a job to do, if you can go home earlier, If you retired early, that's all. That's all there is, over and over, over and over again. Washington - I can't even begin to talk about deals and policies affecting this place Reality of the bottom line of available jobs Because I really don't know. And I recently learned on this front in war. And this, my group, Silicon Valley I mean how many people have an iPhone? How many people have BlackBerry? We are connected to these devices I will never protest This gives a bad impression of the technology revolution. Wailing Jebed, not suitable for this audience Laughter I will not suggest renewal and imitation Without a waste of time. Nobody celebrates fake things They also celebrate the dirty job crew because they know how it is done. And people who use the iPhone have in common, Common systems, over and over again. All of it - and that is what makes this device both Genius innovation So, we have these new tools, you know. We have tools today that do not look like a scoop and a pick. They look like the things we run around with. So the collective effect of all Therefore, this marginalization went to many and many job opportunities. And I realized, perhaps too late in this game - And I hope it isn't, because I don't know if I can do more than 200 of these things But we will do as much as possible. And for me, the most important thing is to realize the importance of things Face situations face to face And in fact I got things wrong, It is not just about members. I got it wrong most of the way So, we think-- who we are, I mean I - The thing that I'm doing is talking about a PR campaign for work, Manual work, and skilled labor. Someone should be there To talk about forgotten benefits I mean grandfather's property. Much of the property we grew up with But you know we lost some of it. Barak wants to create two and a half million jobs. Infrastructure is a huge deal structure. This war on work, which I believe exists, has losses Like other wars. First the infrastructure Second, low rates of enrollment in commercial schools. Every year the number of electricians decreases, Carpenters, plumbers, Welders, and pipeline mechanics, And steam. The infrastructure jobs that everyone talks about creating are a phrase About these people. Who have been decreasing, over and over again. Meanwhile, we got two trillion dollars, at a minimum, According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, We need to spend in order to invent the infrastructure Which is currently ranked fourth. So, if I run anything, not like that, I would simply say that the jobs we wish to accomplish Which we hope to create It will not last if it is not the jobs that people want. I know the goal of this conference Is to celebrate the things near and dear to us, But I also know that the clean and dirty ones are not opposite. They are two sides of the same coin. Just like innovation and imitation, And like risk and responsibility, And like peripetia and anagnorisis Like the poor sheep, which I hope will not be shivering anymore, And like my past time. It was great talking to you And back to work, please? clap", "Bntj6OCe2_g": "From the possible site of the legendary Garden of Eden to an island that may be covering an Alien Base -- Today we look at the 9 Most Mysterious Islands On Earth Number 9. \"Island of Socotra\" Off the coast of Somalia in the Indian ocean is an island that seems as though it belongs on another planet. Socotra Island has long been theorized as a location for the biblical Garden of Eden, and just by looking at pictures of it you can see why. The island is home to several species of plants that are can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found anywhere else on Earth. There are the Dr. Seuss looking Adenium socotranum which have big bulbous trunks and tiny gnarly branches that sprout from their tops and bear flowers that are a marvelous shade of pink. There odd appearance makes them kind of look like giant root vegetables. Then there are the Dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blood Trees which look like perfect natural umbrellas. The have trunks that resemble that of an average tree but their thick tightly bunched branches shoot upwards and form a mushroom like crown. Socotra is also home to three geographically unique species of bird: the socotra sunbird, socotra grosbeak and socotra starling. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many other creatures that inhabit the island other than that of bats and insects and the last time it was home to man was around the year 100 A.D. Adding to the mystery, the island has been the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the years. Number 8. \"Palmyra Atoll\" Though technically not an island but an atoll that formed from coral the mysterious nature of Palmyra Atoll cannot be ignored. Also known as Palmyra Island, the breathtakingly beautiful ringlet sits between American Samoa and Hawaii. Though it is full of lush vegetation and appears unblemished by man the island has long be the subject of superstition and folktales. There have been several cases of violent shipwrecks and mysterious disappearances of ships on and around the island. Those who have observed the island and survived to tell their tale have claimed having seen some extremely bizarre sights like that of floating lights, ghosts and sea monsters. It is also reported to be the home of an incredible amount of sharks who may have developed a distinct taste for humans. There is also the story of lost Incan treasure that may still be on the island. These tales and others which cannot be discussed do to their graphic nature have made Palmyra the stuff of legend amongst sailors and Pacific Islanders for centuries. Number 7. \"Vulcan Island\" Vulcan Island in the Philippines isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily an island that is shrouded in mystery but it definitely is a mindblowing locale. On the northern Philippine island of Luzon there sits a lake named Taal and in that lake there is an island called Taal Volcano, inside this island is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest crater lake and inside of this lake there sits yet another island, known as Vulcan Island. Not only is Vulcan Island one of the most fascinating of natural recursion it happens to be located on one of the most active volcanoes in the entire Pacific Ocean. Because of this fact it is incredibly dangerous to visit Vulcan Island as it has been quaking and bubbling since 1991. Number 6. \"Easter Island\" The world renowned Easter Island still attracts tourists, anthropologists and archaeologists to this day who are both perplexed and in awe of the statues left behind by the ancestors of the native Rapa Nui peoples. Though the mysteries behind these statues, called Moai are now mostly solved, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only puzzle that is confounded visitors to the small island off of Chile. Scientists recently answered one of the biggest questions surrounding the Moai which was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow did the Rapa Nui move these massive stone idols?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 They found out that these statues were specifically designed to have pot bellies so that they could be rocked back and forth until they were eventually wiggled to where they wanted them. But the mystery that still remains unsolved doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do with the Moai but rather the people that built them. The Rapa Nui have been found to have a completely separate genetic heritage to that of nearby native South American peoples. In fact their closest genetic relatives actually came from Pacific Islanders that live near Southeast Asia. So what is the mystery? Well despite being located in the Pacific, Easter Island is still thousands of miles away from the Rapa Nui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearest relatives. So how did they get there? And how did they build such advanced structures and invent their own agricultural system at such an early period in history despite being geographically isolated from civilizations with similar advancements? Number 5. \"The Island of The Dolls\"-The Mexico City borough of Xochimilco is steeped in Mexican history. Because it has long been the hub that connects the various canals and lakes of Mexico it has been the cultural melting pot of the country. One particular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfloating garden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the canals of Xochimilco may be eerie to outsiders but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s origins come from a caring place, in line with Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tradition of honoring those who have passed from this life to the next. The legend goes like this, one day a man found the body of a young girl who had met with a tragic fate in the waters of one of the canals. When he later returned to the spot he found her he spotted a doll floating in the water and believed it to have belonged to the girl. In order to pay tribute to the girl he tied the doll to a nearby tree. As the days passed he still felt like the girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at rest so he started to bring more dolls and hang them on the trees. Though no one knows if this story is more than myth, it has become a tradition to hang dolls on the trees of the floating garden which is now known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLa Isla de las Munecas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Island of the Dolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Although this tradition comes from the heart, it is still quite a frightening sight as the dolls are in various states of decay and some have even told tales of them coming to life. Number 4. \"Poveglia Island\"-Just off the coast of Venice, Italy lies Poveglia Island which may have one of the most twisted and horrifying histories of any island on Earth. During the devastating Bubonic Plague outbreak of the 14th century the government of Venice decided to try and quarantine the infected by sending them to Poveglia Island where they would live out the rest of their days. Because of this, even after the plague subsided the site became basically a national lazaretto and used anytime an outbreak of disease occurred. Poveglia would being to serve a new purpose in the 1920s when a mental hospital was built on it and the terrors that the patients were subject to at the hands of their caretakers only added to the haunting history of the island. The island has since fallen into dangerous level of disrepair and the Italian tourism bureau technically has forbidden people from visiting unless they go through an extensive application and interview process. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped ghosthunters and thrill-seekers alike from finding alternative ways to sneak onto the spooky island. Number 3. \"Isla Bermeja\" From the 1500s up until the late 1900s there existed an island off the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, at least according to maps there was. The islet of Bermeja was long used as the geographical boundary for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section of the Gulf but several mapping expeditions in the 20th century that went looking for the island frankly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. There are several theories as to how an island could appear on maps for the better part of four hundred years but then suddenly disappear. Most modern day experts believe that the island never existed at all and may have been the result of a cartographic mistake that went uncorrected. Some say that the island, which was described as being the color of strawberry blonde hair, did exist but sank into the ocean. This theory is backed up by British maps dating back to the 1840s which describe the island being slowly swallowed by the sea. However, there are those who believe that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance and the fact that it had political significance are not mere coincidence. Because the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most oil-rich regions on Earth some have theorized that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence was only perpetuated by the Mexican government in order to strategically extend their claim. On the flipside, there are also conspiracy theorists who believe the island did exist but was destroyed by the United States government for the same reason. Other conspiracies claim that the island still exists but that the evidence has been wiped from maps due to it being the site of top-secret activities. Number 2. \"Floating Eye Island\" While surveying the Parana Delta of northern Argentina in 2016 with the hopes of finding the perfect setting for his upcoming film, Argentinian filmmaker Sergio Neuspillerm found one of the most peculiar places in the world. Deep in the misty marshlands Sergio came upon a lake that appeared to be shaped like a perfect circle. Not only that, but there was an island in the lake that was exactly the same shape and it filled up the majority of the lake, leaving only a thin ring of water around it. Sergio was fascinated with the island that would come to be called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and quickly returned with a small research party. His team reported some strange findings. They found that the island was actually floating in the water and appeared to rotate around the lake on its own axis. They also say that the water was astonishingly cold and clear and the bottom of the lake was significantly harder than the rest of the ground in the area. Because of these mysterious observations Sergio decided to scrap the initial film project he was working on in favor of shooting a documentary on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Since the word got out on Floating Eye Island several conspiracy theories with it at the center have arisen. The most popular of these is that the island is covering a secret alien base. Number 1. \"Diego Garcia\" In the middle of the Indian Ocean is Diego Garcia Island which has been shrouded in conspiracy. The island, which is part of the Chagos Archipelago, was uninhabited when it was settled by French colonists in 1793 who brought hundreds of slaves to the islands to work their plantations. The island would eventually fall under British control as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. After slavery was abolished, the freed slaves (who had established their own cultural identity) stayed at the island and continued to till the land. But the Chagossians, as they had come to be called, were forced out of their home in 1971, in order to make way for a United States Naval Base. The US and UK had come to an agreement allowing the US Navy to take control of the island, but the base that the Navy wanted to build required the Chagossians to be unwillingly relocated. The arguably unethical methods the United States used to get the islanders to comply, such as slowly cutting off their supplies or euthanizing their pets would only add depth to the conspiracy theories that would subsequently arise about the island.", "H2rG4Dg6xyI": "I've something very important to tell you today.I\u2019m so glad I was invited to this particular TEDx meeting.I really am, because it\u2019s all about dreams,and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,and no kidding, that\u2019s all I do. I also drink water.When I was about 36,I had just gotten through a very bad year.I\u2019d gotten a divorce, I&nbsp;had no money, I was in New York City,I had two very small children.I couldn\u2019t get a day care center,so I couldn\u2019t take a job.We stayed in welfare hotels in New York;that\u2019s worth writing a novel about.They have cockroaches,so I would tell the kids,we could name the cockroaches,and we played \"early computer games\" with cockroaches&nbsp;on the wall.(Laughter)But we got a day care center, I got a job,we got an apartment,and the kids were in school.And I was washing disheswhen I was 36, and I thought,\u201cBy God, we made it.\"The kids were great,I cried a lot, but we did it.We did it, that\u2019s good, I\u2019m proud of&nbsp;myself.And then I had another thought.I thought,\u201cIs this it?Is that what I get? Is my gravestone going to say,\"Her house was frequently clean for very brief periods of time?\"(Laughter)I was going to do something;I don\u2019t know&nbsp;what.I didn\u2019t have particular talents,I wasn\u2019t very good at things.But I figured, I just have a bad attitude,because that was about the 60s,and everybody learnedabout positive thinking,and \"believe it and you can achieve It,\"and \u201ccreate your&nbsp;own reality,\"I thought, \u201cHey, 36,maybe I\u2019m really old and uglyand nobody will ever loveme again, okay.But that\u2019s not so old;I might live a while,I\u2019m going to see if I can figure out what the hell my dream is and go get it!\u201dSo I went to everything.I stood in rooms where they all stand up and say,\u201cI can do it! I can do it!\u201dAnd I did that,but I still couldn\u2019t do it.And they said, \u201cThink positive\u201d,they said, \u201cCreate your own reality\u201d.I didn\u2019t believe that, and you know what?I was raised in the 50s.In my day, if you saidyou could influence the universeto do what&nbsp;you wanted,or turn peoples sentencesbackwards, we called a doctor.(Laughter)I am not a \"New Age\" lady;I am an \"Old Age\" lady.And so I just gave up.I thought, \u201cWell, I guessI\u2019m going to be average;somebody\u2019s got to do it.\u201dAnd I tried to forget about it.Then something astonishing happened that didn\u2019t just change my life;it has already, in the ensuing years,changed the lives of thousandsand thousands of people.And that all started in my second job.I had a job in the evening where I ran an \"encounter&nbsp;group\".Encounter&nbsp;groups were something that the psychiatrist had learnedin the drug program,&nbsp;where people attack you,until you cave in, and they screamat you, and yell at you,and you holler at them,and everybody feels better.I was there and he said,\u201cYou\u2019re hired; you can be a leader.\u201dBecause I was good at it; in my family,we always hollered at each other.(Laughter)It was a natural ability,I&nbsp;didn\u2019t think much of it,and I had groups every night after work.I had one on Tuesday night,which is going to go down in history.In this groupthere was somebody named Ronnie.Well, that\u2019s what I call him.I\u2019ve been telling this storyso long I don\u2019t remember his name.Ronnie was different.We used to call&nbsp;him \"Type B\".He didn\u2019t have any feelings he was aware of.He came because we were basically his social group.But he leaked hostility.It just came out of him,and everybody laying their eyes on himreally wanted to hurt him.We had to walk him home&nbsp;after the group,but we were used to him, we liked him.And he was very&nbsp;valuable.Because people would come inwho couldn\u2019t get to their feelings,this one woman came in and she said,\u201cI quit law school to putmy husband through law school;I became a waitress,and put him through law schooland then after that, he divorced me,and married somebody younger and prettier,and took the house and&nbsp;everything.Naturally, because he\u2019s a lawyerand I couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer,but that\u2019s okay I guess, you know,if I wasn\u2019t enough.But now he wants&nbsp;the kidsbecause he says he can give thema better life, and he really can,but I feel funny about it.\u201dI was looking at the groupand they were going \u201cGrr!\u201dI said, \u201cListen, you\u2019d better get angry,or they\u2019re goingto find him and kill him.\"And she said \u2018I\u2019m not angry.\u201dI said, \u201cTry.\u201dShe said, \u201cI\u2019m angry, I\u2019m angry.\u201dI said,&nbsp;\u201cRonnie, would you putyour fingers in your ears?\u201dHe did.I said, \u201cLook at&nbsp;Ronnie.\u201dShe said, \"Eww, I wanna smack him!\u201d(Laughter)And she said, \u201cRonnie,what do you&nbsp;dress like that for?You idiot!\u201dAnd she&nbsp;switched over to her husbandand she got mad at him,and she just went off like a volcano.Oh, it was so satisfyingfor everybody in the room.(Laughter)When she was done,she looked strong and calmlike you do when you get to your feelings.She said,&nbsp;\u201cI can\u2019t believeI\u2019m letting him get away with this!\u201dAnd she said, \u201cOh&nbsp;Ronnie, I\u2019m sorry!\u201dHe said, \u201cI\u2019m always gladto be of service.\u201dSo, he was very helpful.When I\u2019d have a go-aroundI\u2019d say, \u201cDo you want to work tonight?\u201dSomebody would&nbsp;say,\u201cI had a fight with my boyfriend,I'd better work on my feelings,\u201dand I\u2019d say, \u2018What about you?\u201dAnd they'd say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201dI\u2019d say, \u201cWhat&nbsp;about you, Ronnie?\u201djust out of politeness,and he would always say, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dThis particular&nbsp;nightthat shall go down in history,I said, \u2018How are you doing, Ronnie?\u201dand he said, \u201cI\u2019m&nbsp;depressed.\u201dI said, \u201cOh! A feeling! Um...Why are you depressed?\u201dHe said, \u201cI hate my&nbsp;apartment.\u201dI said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get another&nbsp;one\u201dThey were very easyto get then, very cheap.He said, \u201cI can\u2019t get another apartmentbecause I\u2019m too depressed.\u201dI said, \u201cI think I fell for&nbsp;something.\u201dAnd someone raised her hand and said,\u201cYou didn\u2019t fall for anything.If you saw&nbsp;his apartment,you\u2019d&nbsp;be depressed too.\u201dI said, \u201cOh. Reality. I like reality.Okay, why don\u2019t you guys go out,get a Village Voice,and find him an apartment,we\u2019ll have a painting party, I\u2019ll bring a potted plant,and if he\u2019s still depressed,I\u2019ll send him to&nbsp;somebodywho\u2019s had some training.\u201dAnd they said \u201cOkay!\" and they brightened up.You&nbsp;have to understand,these were neurotic New Yorkers.New Yorkers do not mind showing you that they\u2019re neurotic.I was raised before that in Los Angeles and they\u2019re crazy too, but they cool it.In New York they go, \u201cI\u2019m neurotic!\u201dThey don\u2019t care.So these people cheered up,you could see it.They went out, got an apartment,we had a painting party, it looked great,and the next week we had a go-aroundand I&nbsp;said, \u201cHow are you, Ronnie?\u201dHe said \u201cI\u2019m happy!\u201dI said, \u201cWow! That\u2019s great!\u201cOK! So who wants to work tonight?\u201dHe said, \"Wait a minute.\"I said, \u201cYeah?\u201dHe said, \u201cWell now I want a woman.\"(Laughter)I said, \"A woman?\"He said, \"Yeah, \"I havea place to entertain now.\"We had to be emotionallyhonest in these groupsso somebody, a woman, said to&nbsp;him,\"Ronnie, women hate you.\"(Laughter)He said, \"I know; fix me.\"(Laughter)And they said, \"Fix you?\"I said, \"Why not? What the hell!Stand up and let\u2019s take a look.\"Ronnie, he didn\u2019t look good.He had one positive attribute:he was extremely clean.That\u2019s where it ended.His pants fit wrong.He looked wrong.He talked wrong.So the women took him to the storeand got him better clothes,and the men took him&nbsp;to the gymwhere he&nbsp;could stand&nbsp;up straighterand not be in danger all&nbsp;the time,and when it was his turnto work on Tuesday nightshe would stand up and tryto pretend he was, basically, a human.Somebody would cometo him and say, \u201cHello,\"and he would say, \u201cH-u-llo!\"And she\u2019d say, \"Not like that,that\u2019s disgusting!\"He\u2019d say, \"Give me another try,\"and finally after about six months,he said, \"I think I\u2019m as good as I\u2019m going to get.\"We looked at himand said, \"I think it's true.\"Okay, let\u2019s set a date for a partyand let's go find some women.\"After that,&nbsp;everybody would come in every week saying,\"I got one!I was in the supermarket and I sawthis woman standing there;she had one can of cat foodand one frozen dinner,and I said, 'You want to go to a party?\"Someone else said, \u201cI was walkingdown the hall of my apartment buildingwith trash, and I heard somebody crying.I saw too many wine bottles in the trash,so I knocked on the doorand someone cameto the door and said, 'Yes?'I said, \"You want to go to a&nbsp;party?\"(Laughter)We got innocent visiting cousins from Ohio, and we had the party.It was a triumph.Nobody talked to Ronnie.(Laughter)But he'd learned how to makehors d\u2019oeuvres, and he was very happy.And when it was over I said,\"You know what, guys?Keep throwing&nbsp;parties; you never know,Ronnie could find somebody.But it\u2019s good for everybody, I want youall to do it, it's good for everybody!\"They said okay, and they&nbsp;did!And he found somebody.She was actually quite cute to look at,but she was very peculiar in her&nbsp;head.But, hell, it was Ronnie,and so we were very happy.They didn't come as often,but she would drag him in to confront him.She liked that idea.And I don't remember whatshe would confront him for,except for one thing,and this is what happened that night.She came in, dragged him in,somebody had been working,her dog&nbsp;had died and she was crying.When she saw them come inshe said, \"It's okay, I'll wait.They walked in and I said, \"Yeah what's up?\"she said, \"I have to confront Ronniebecause he uses too many adjectivesand I think he does it on purpose.\"And I looked at her and I said,\"I&nbsp;wouldn't take thatfrom any man; take him down.\"So she went, \"I\u2019m angry, Ronnie!\"And he said, \"I\u2019m&nbsp;sorry!\"Then they were done,they hugged each other,they walked out of the room,they were so happy.Somebody looked at themand said, \"What a pair of dingbats.\"I said, \"What's&nbsp;wrong with this picture?Ronnie is the only person in this roomwith a good apartment, who is notsleeping alone, including me.\"I said, \"Listen, listen.What if we got together every weekand you told us what you wanted?\"\"We don't know what we want.\"\"Well, we help you figure it outand then we made&nbsp;you dowhat you want to do?I mean the world makes you dowhat you have to do;you have to pay your taxes,you have to show up,what if we made you dowhat you want to do?You could have your dream;you could have any dream!\"They said, \"Barbara, we\u2019re too neurotic.\"I said, \"What are you talking about?We could put a man on the moon,we got Ronnie a woman!\"(Laughter)And we did it.Amazing things started to happen.Right in that group, we got somebodyinto law school and through law school,and she started a law firm with another woman.Somebody adopted a kid,and somebody went to Cairo.We got wonderful things.So, my wish was to create a workshop,and I did, and everybody helped me.I went around&nbsp;the country; didn't makemoney but I had a lot of fun.I went around the&nbsp;countryteaching people how to be in these Success Teams,because they were just great.Then at the end,&nbsp;I\u2019d say,\"I\u2019m going to prove it to you;give me an impossible dream.\"These are all true stories,I couldn't make these up.I was in Greenville, North Carolina,and I said, \"Tell me an impossible dream;I want&nbsp;to show you something.\"A woman stood up and said,\"I want to dance with&nbsp;Patrick Swayze.\"That's from \"Dirty Dancing.\"So you could hear women say,\"Yeah, you and every&nbsp;otherwoman alive on earth.\"Another woman waved&nbsp;her hand.I said, \"Does anyone&nbsp;have ideas?\"A woman raised her hand, and said,\"Patrick Swayze's mother has a resort30 miles away; I work there weekends.He comes Wednesday,I've danced with him,I'll take you up;you wanna dance with him?\u201d(Laughter)(Applause)That was nothing.Somebody stood up, she was crying,she said \"I want an animal refugefor old dogs and old animals.They just don\u2019t get treated.It\u2019s terrible, even farm animals,\"I just said, \"What\u2019s your obstacle?\"I'm going to teach youabout \"wish and obstacle\";that is the secret.If you don't learn it, nothing happens.I said, \"What\u2019s your obstacle?\"\"What\u2019s my obstacle?!I don\u2019t have any money, land, license,any training; I have nothing.I can't do it!\"Someone waved&nbsp;her hand, they always do,and said, \"My friend's motherjust was in an auto-accident,she hurt her back, she won't be ableto run her refuge anymore.She can't find anybodyyoung to run it for her.She\u2019s got a license, the money, the land,she\u2019s even got the animals!\"(Laughter)And it wouldn't stop.Oh God, I\u2019ve got so many.There was a womanin a&nbsp;group and she said,\"I make harps; I make them from a specialkind of wood they have in England,and now it's gone.The last tree is gone.There is no tree left,I can't make any more harps!\"Someone in the backraised her hand and said,\"Are you talking&nbsp;about such and so?\"and she gave a Latin name,and she said, \u201cYeah!\"She said, \"My brother has a big stand of those in Australia.Come back here, I\u2019ll give you his number.\"Every time; it never fails.This is a funny one;there was a lady in New York,a very weird&nbsp;looking lady,and she got up in the aisle,and said, \"I need a chimp. I\u2019ve got to rent a chimp.\"I said \"What?\"I've got to rent a chimp.\"I said, \"A chimpanzee? You want to rent?\"She said, \u201cYes.\u201dShe said, \"What I&nbsp;dois during lunch hour,I go through the big corporationswith a chimpanzeeand a bunch&nbsp;of cute toys for kids,and everybody comes out into the corridorbecause I have a chimpanzeeand they buy all the stuff.The chimpanzee costs me about $200 a day,and I sell about&nbsp;$400 a day,so I'm making a living.But they just raised chimpanzee rentalsup to $600 a day; I\u2019m out of business!\"A woman in the back,dressed very&nbsp;nicely, said,\"I think we can do better than that.\"I said, \"You&nbsp;rent chimpanzees?\"She said, \u201cYes, and giraffes, rhinoceroses, and horses.\"(Laughter)I said, \"In New York City?\"She said, \u201cYes.\"I said, \u201cWhy?\"She said, \"This is wherethe commercials are&nbsp;made.We\u2019ve got trainers too.We\u2019ve got everything.\"I thought, \"Blow me down.You never know who you\u2019re talking to!\u201dWe\u2019re all the center of enormous amountsof information and connectionsthat we don't need and we don't think of,unless somebody asks us.I began to realize that I had foundthe absolute guaranteed secret to success,and - boy! - did it have nothing to dowith positive thinking.Oh boy, nothing.(Laughter)Here\u2019s&nbsp;the punchline:Isolation is the dream&nbsp;killer,not your rotten attitude.You can hate yourself,you always do, you know it.You wake up and go, \"I'm fat.\"You know you do that.If you&nbsp;wake up in the morningand say, \"I'm here!\u201dyour wife will kill youin your sleep tomorrow night.(Laughter)And I'll&nbsp;help her.You can't walk around faking feelings,I mean to yourself anyway.I just feel bad that everybody started it.That says, \u201cCross out Positive Thinking.\"And this says \u201dHere\u2019s a team.\"Right?Not necessarily closestfriends or parents,because they\u2019ve got attitudes about you.Strangers are great, absolutely great.So here's what you do:You get a team.You figure out what you want,and then you say,\"Here is my wish,and here is my obstacle.Here's what I want,and here is why I cannot have it.\"If you don't say both thosethings, nothing happens.We are problem-solving animals.If you say, \"I\u2019d love to be a ballerina.\"Everybody goes, \u201cMmm.\"If you say I\u2019d love to&nbsp;be a ballerina,but I\u2019m 44 years old.Every mind starts working.Even if&nbsp;people don't like you,they'll solve your problem:\"I heard about, 44-year-olds, there's one in Boston.There's a new ballet troupe, I read about in a magazine, I\u2019ll find it.\"People want to help.Amazing things will happen to you.I\u2019ll give you my last stories because they\u2019re so good.Someone called me from Toronto.She was a Success Teamleader and she said,\"We have an accountant in Toronto,I have to tell you the story.We had a group with six people;there were five women, and this guy.He was so helpful;he knew everybody in town,he got them bank loans,he introduced them to everybody.But he never wanted anything.Finally they said, \"Listen,you have to tell us what you want.We can't take anything from you anymore!'And he said, \"I can\u2019t tell you;it\u2019s too stupid, you\u2019ll laugh at me.\"They said, 'Oh no, absolutely not.Barbara Sher says,\"You never laugh at anyone's dream.\"He said, \"Okay, well,I want&nbsp;to be a cowboy.\"So naturally they all laughed.(Laughter)Someone said, \"What\u2019s the obstacle?\"He said, \"What\u2019s the&nbsp;obstacle?I don\u2019t even know if there are cowboys,I liked cowboy movies as a kidand I wanted to be one, that's it.I don\u2019t know if there are cowboys.Second, I\u2019ve got a business;I can\u2019t walk away hoping to find a cow.What are you talking&nbsp;about?'Someone said, \"Wait a minute,\"and called her roommate.She&nbsp;remembered her roommatehad an uncle in Alberta who was a rancher.And soon he&nbsp;called.And we said, \"Turn on the speakerphone.\"The guy said, \"I hearyou\u2019re an accountant.I\u2019d like to fly you out oneweek a month to do my&nbsp;books.\"And the accountant said,\"You can do it online.\"He said, 'I know, I don\u2019t wantmy business on the internet.\"And then the women kicked himand he said, \"I want to be&nbsp;a cowboy.\"He said, \"You can be a cowboy;just finish in a couple days,and you can on a drivewe always have&nbsp;them.\"He said, \"You have cowboys?\"He said, \"Yeah, if you had steakthis month, somewhere there's a cowboy.\"So he did it.He sent back photographs.He went out, he became a cowboy,and he does his Toronto accounts on the Internet.But the best story of all, and the one I want to tell you most of all,happened in Memphis&nbsp;in the summer.August was very hot, and I was askingfor impossible dreams.A woman in the front row raised her hand,and I said, \"Yes, what is your wish and what is your obstacle?\"So she said, \"I'm tired;I want to go on a cruise.\"\"Okay, what is your obstacle?\"And she said, \"Well, I have three: money,I have a sick daughter at home,- an adult daughter, I can't leave herfor a second, I could hardly get here -and I'd rather&nbsp;not mention the third.\"And before I could ask if anybody had an idea,a guy came&nbsp;running up the aislein a white t-shirt with a number on it,a pair of shorts, waving a piece of paper,and he grabbed the mic and he said,\"I ran for the Heart Associationthis morning and I won a cruise for one.My wife isn't going to let me&nbsp;goon a cruise for one; you take it!\"Everyone got excited and applaudedthat&nbsp;she had her cruiseand didn\u2019t have to worry about money.She said, \"That's sweet,but I really can't leave my daughter.\"A woman on the aisle raised her hand and she said,\"I'm a public&nbsp;health nurse and every year, to keep our license,we have to give ten daysof pro-bono free work,and I haven\u2019t found anybody and it's already August,so can you&nbsp;use ten days?\"Everybody got excitedand I said, \"I think you're going to haveto tell us your third obstacle.\"\"Well, it's embarrassing, but my daughter\u2019s in bedbecause she's been physically injured and she's frightened.Her ex-husband is stalking her.\"And the room fell silent.I mean everyone thought, \"Oh, shit!\"A&nbsp;voice came from the back of the room.I never saw this man\u2019s face,I will never forget his voice,he said, \"I'm a cop, what\u2019s his&nbsp;name?\"(Laughter)She went on the cruise.But here's what I want to tell you:We depend on each other's dreams coming true.What do you think's going to happen now that she went on that cruise?It\u2019s just a cruise.But her daughter\u2019s going to get well;she\u2019s not scared anymore.Her daughter's going to become a teacher.She's going to understandkids who are scared.She's going to understand kids who arephysically scared because she gets that.Every time you make someone else\u2019sdream come true, it echoes.No magical New Age way,it echoes in practical, wonderful ways.You have to, you have to.You have to figure out what you want,you have to ask for help,and you have to remember\"wishes and obstacles.\"And you have to let&nbsp;people help youbecause you have to go after your dreams,and never tell me you can't do it.Just remember: we got Ronnie a great apartment in New Yorkand a woman, a crazy woman,that he loves with all his heart.We can do anything.That\u2019s what I wanted to tell you.(Applause)", "Xg37L5z5r_M": "[Music] so we're gonna give you five small challenges and you're gonna have three minutes to complete each one and you can give up any time within those three minutes but we're going to make a bet with you for every challenge that you successfully complete you can ask the prefix to do something for you but for every challenge that you fail we get to ask you to do something so do you accept is this gonna get thirty thousand views  make sense the challenge okay yeah sure place for matches like this and challenge your friends to create a square by moving just one match [Music]  nope that's cheating I'm only but you've one of them nope Jenny will spawn for me I don't maybe it's because it stands on the table I'm not singing it so I mean if I do this matter what size the squares okay no cheater  yeah swear him in on there you go yeah you got it  okay yeah yes to win the band move this match creating a tiny square in the center there are one two three four coins in this room and one two three four five coins in this room your friends have to move just one point and end up with five coins in each row I  want to take the first two heads to just soak it in  so you need five minutes show yeah  what if I did something like that this makes no sense to me I'm telling you I'm very straight down there's only nine questions and that's boring for can't I just know that doesn't work Rachel do you give up Rachel do you give up me do you give up Rachel help me so it's this one of the points there's five okay done if I did this or no if I lifted the coin yeah  the secret is simple it's eleven matchsticks the road explain to your friends they have to move five of them to create nine plus something like that well that's not nine well I'm gonna  create the number nine to create nine  it's an obscure challenge to create a nine no no no you have nine and five sticks okay but I need the number nine I did what you asked you have to admit I did what you asked oh the word nine okay when they give up explain it really easy just move these five matchsticks and you end up with the word spent involves six glasses but liquid in these three and leave the other three empty explained your friend has to rearrange the glasses so they run full empty full empty full empty but they're only allowed to move one block  [Music]  you want to move 100 I'm optimistic but I would not call that fall yeah when they give up simply pick up this glass pour the liquid into here replace it and you've won the bet the glass with water and challenge your friends to float a paperclip on top of the liquid okay I use the tested  come on monkey could do this it's just physics surface tension so I put this in one throw I want to make like a flipping contraption hanging it from the sides is cheating I need a copy  are you kidding okay already yeah  Wow surface tension oh yeah baby oh yeah go B this is good surface tension it's not rocket science come on kick it seriously every time they play something into the glass you'll sink to the bottom the secret is to form one of the paper clips into an L shape then balance another paper clip from the arm of the L and carefully place the entire arrangement onto the top of the water amazingly the paper clip [Music]", "lAuZw-ZFSjc": "[Music]  [Applause]  [Applause] flame his first half

place even after the last play these two final these two are still going at it well the last two times we see their from them getting pounded on each time and he's waiting for them now to throw a flag he's trying to keep his cool hand up inside the facemask and if these officials would watch what's going up you gotta go do that now  I'm eating burritos bigger than you again Seahawks playing without Sidney Rice who injured his knee in the first half Wilson on the fake throwing down field for Golden Tate great in the air it's safe to confirm Jenkins taunting on his way to the edge swag is down as he scores the touchdown  the Horace Jenkins family  and he didn't intercept that pass it's a great Johnson isn't the only Texan tearing it up DeAndre Hopkins is playing like a number-one receiver I win the round I win the wrong with you Buffalo - man don't just like you well we can box  what before somebody touching me after the play is over a tumble they don't do to me cause it's not we'll talk I know so let's move it let's move you get you router  [Music]  Oh Oh already break your ankles now further their pads already break ankles on the rail shit hey I just finish it I just finish it all started [Applause]  for a touchdown Harris playing off get up on the route and Randy Moss without even really being [Music]  that is a disgusting act by Randy Moss  like down here come home - did they  remember that play went number 24 ran the ball underneath humble and the affirmative get up says the tailback Jacob's gets it and scores touchdown Giants [Applause]  Jakob's fires the football into the play clock as the Giants now jump out in front him introductions he takes his helmet and he hits his hip then we understand there was a handful of stitches to close up that gam  Garcia off the plate that railing right has a touchdown Terrell Owens  where's it going right to the center of the stadium right to the Dallas Cowboys logo he looks defense back on track last week last year - Owens touchdown once again heading for midfield there he goes and he's there's going to be a penalty on George T because he's going to clock  now teams going to be kicked out of the game  who's Corey white and now this action here totally uncalled for quick turn Dolan hit [Applause] now you to do it at one point again 10 15 years ago you competed is offensively the feet there was no vowel on the play was not a hold that the defender was just overpowered first thing  [Applause] chased inside the 20 inside the 10 into the end zone backwards for the touchdown Wow the Washington Redskins will tell you that there's no way to catch him once he gets out there Scandrick the last guy with a chance you know it's an interesting call because they had two winners do how does popcorn ready Oh DeSean Jackson who's back from a little lightweight suspension oh I got that 50-yard bomb oh I'm out I'm gonna go now you know what coach Perry take that so now I'm gonna give it to you again take them a touch you a little bit and in fact I'm gonna wipe you off but I'm a white there 50-yard playoff the same time referee calls it an animal walk back in the rest at through the flag I'm gonna talk to you now I'm a punk because I'm a bump into you watch out Lori get that things in my team if the shot I taught you better", "lwvTXmBJSnw": "in the world of muscle building supplements things can get very confusing very fast between having to sort through claims like site specific muscle growth such as building more muscles specifically on your chest and arms or other claims in which testosterone boosters promise to be as effective as steroids without any of the side effects of course it could become very difficult to sort out fact from fiction and to get the right supplements that have actually been scientifically proven to be effective and just to help you ensure that I don't have any kind of bias and that I'm not paid off by some supplement company I'm not going to be promoting any specific brand and you won't find any affiliate links in this video meaning I'm not making any money from supplement companies for sharing this information so there's no incentive for me to not tell the truth with that said let's start with a couple supplements that aren't going to be worth your money mass gainers are not going to be worth your money there's no doubt that they'll provide you with the massive amount of calories but most of those calories are going to be coming from sugar so you really have to ask yourself what is it that you're gaining muscle or body fat you're better off making your own mass gainer by taking protein powder adding one to two tablespoons of peanut butter a banana oats and whole milk and blending it all together another waste of time supplement is pretty much every testosterone supplement on the market even the best testosterone supplements are usually only going to raise your testosterone levels by twenty to forty percent maximum this is simply not high enough to notice any real changes in athletic performance while there may be some ingredients in the testosterone boosters that will help improve your libido you shouldn't expect any real muscle building benefits from such an increase next is branched chain amino acids or a b c double a's you don't need b c double a's while bulking because you'll most likely be getting all of your amino acids from the food you eat and especially if you also take a protein shake an argument can be made for the effectiveness of BCAAs during a cut but while you're in a calorie surplus trying to build muscle they're not really necessary the same goes for l-glutamine L carnitine and L arginine now the first controversial supplement that you may actually want to look into if you're planning on training in a fasted state is h mb h mb is a byproduct of the breaks out of leucine and leucine is the most powerful amino acid for muscle growth the HMV obtained from leucine can slow down protein breakdown rates and building muscle is all about decreasing protein breakdown rates while increasing protein synthesis rates however when leucine is broken down only about 5% of the leucine is turned into h mb so supplementing with more about 3 to 5 grams depending on the study has been shown to increase a number of performance markers including strength speed muscle size endurance and your rate of recovery the controversy lies in the fact that other studies have shown that H MB is not that effective so the results are mixed however there has been enough evidence for the International Society of Sports Nutrition to make a position statement on its effectiveness this is something that the ISSN rarely does unless there's a good amount of research supporting a supplement like there is with creatine for example but based on the research they recommend that you should have about 38 milligrams of H MB for each kilogram you way to experience the benefits this will work out to a daily dose of about 3 to 4 grams for most people you can divide your daily dose in half or in 3 ways and spread it out evenly throughout the day but make sure you take one of those doses preferably directly before your workout this supplement is not as necessary for those of you training in a Fed state but the anti catabolic effect that it provides makes it ideal for those of you that are training in a fasted state and want something to reduce muscle breakdown rates during your workout the last thing to keep in mind is that it may take up to two weeks of consistently taking H MB to see the full benefits now if you only have the money for just one supplement that's made to build more muscle then you're gonna want to go with creatine according to a meta-analysis published in the Journal of physiology creatine is considered the most effective natural muscle building supplement out there and this meta-analysis wasn't some small study the researchers compared the effectiveness of 250 supplements for muscle growth and they found that creatine had the most significant impact on muscle mass creatine will help give you more energy and it'll help improve your performance during your workouts especially with high intensity activities it'll also help increased strength lead to a more favorable testosterone to cortisol ratio and help you recover faster on top of that according to the center of human nutrition weightlifters that supplement seen for three months tend to gain between two to six and a half pounds of lean body mass compared to lifters that train without it the original and most studied form of creatine is creatine monohydrate but nowadays there are a ton of new creatine products to choose from there's Cree aklan and creatine HCl which is believed to dissolve better in water and can help reduce bloating and cramping and there's also creatine ethyl ester as well as creatine nitrate which are believed to absorb better than creatine monohydrate requiring smaller doses out of all of these there's no doubt that monohydrate is the most well researched proven and it's also the cheapest with that said many people swear by these other forms of creatine so you may find some unique benefits by experimenting especially if you find yourself getting bloated or an upset stomach from creatine use as far as how much to take you may choose to do a week-long loading phase where you would have 20 grams of creatine every day for five to seven days and then you would transition to only having 5 grams per day while you can do that it's not absolutely necessary if you just take 5 grams per day every day from the start instead of loading you'll still saturate your muscles with creatine it just may take a little longer some people choose to cycle creatine where they take it for six to 12 weeks and then stop for four weeks while there is no conclusive evidence in favor of cycling or not cycling if you choose to cycle you may want to do a loading phase at the beginning of each of your cycles on the other hand if you consistently take it without stopping you may want to drop to only 3 grams per day rather than a full 5 as that should be enough to keep your muscles saturated with the creatine now regardless of which creatine you get or how much you take you should know that about 20 to 30 percent of the population is considered non-responsive to creatine use which means they won't notice significant changes when taking this supplement another supplement that you may want to consider is a good pre-workout supplement an effective pre-workout supplement will help increase your strength and energy during your workouts as well as give you a better pump great pre workouts will typically contain ingredients like beta alanine which will delay the onset of fatigue and increase muscular endurance citrulline alley which can help improve blood flow increased performance improve recovery and even provide a slight boost in growth hormone during a workout and the last ingredient you'll definitely want is caffeine as this will be what's providing most of the boost in your energy levels the problem with pre workouts is that they can get a little tricky because if you take them too often you'll feel like you can't work out without the boost that they provide you'll literally feel sluggish and tired in the gym on the days that you don't take it so to avoid this and to get the maximum benefit out of a pre-workout I recommend only taking it two to three times a week on the days that you're really gonna push yourself in the gym let's move on to protein powder now even though you don't need protein powder to build muscle since you can get all the protein you need from real food protein powder can still make a couple things easier for you first of all you can take it on the go and it's not always possible to prepare a high-protein meal on the go it can also help you meet your daily protein requirements without making you feel excessively full you want to have at least point seven two point eight grams of protein for each pound of bodyweight to give you the maximum muscle building benefits and if you're cutting you may want to have a little more than that the protein will be used in a process known as protein synthesis to repair and build muscle as long as protein synthesis rates are higher than protein breakdown rates you'll have a positive nitrogen balance putting your body in a more ideal state for growth this is also why it may be a good idea to have a protein shake after your workout when you workout protein breakdown rates will rise you can slow this down and increase protein synthesis rates just by having a protein shake soon after your workout if you workout in a fasted state then having that protein shake soon or after a workout rather than later can really help with building muscle however if you have some protein before your workout you don't have to worry so much about how soon you take down that protein shake even if it's hours later when choosing the right type of protein you have a number of options including whey casein soy rice beef being egg pea and hemp just to name a few now just to make it super simple for you studies show that animal-based protein powders lead to higher protein synthesis rates when compared to plant-based sources this doesn't mean that you can't go with a plant-based protein powder like soy rice or pea as long as you have a variety of plant-based sources throughout the day you can actually achieve a more balanced amino acid profile with that said if you can have a dairy based protein powder studies show that they will typically outperform soy for muscle building purposes the two main dairy based protein powders are whey and casein whey protein has a faster digestion time allowing it to get into the bloodstream quickly on the other hand casein takes longer to digest sometimes taking up to four hours whey is better if you're having it after workout not only because of its faster absorption rate but also because it has a better amino acid profile for building muscle to be more specific it's one of the best sources of leucine which as we discussed is the most important amino acid for muscle growth now this doesn't mean that casing doesn't offer its own unique advantages that may make you want to consider getting it to taking casein before bed has been shown in studies to help increase type 2 muscle fiber size as well as overall muscle strength this may be because you'll be able to maintain a more positive protein balance while you sleep if you consume a slow digesting source of protein beforehand however if you're only looking for a post-workout supplement or you can only choose one of the two I recommend way over casing now within the category of whey protein you have concentrate and isolated while a concentrate will probably be the cheaper of the two it will also contain less protein and more carbs and fats instead besides concentrate and isolate there's also hydrolyzed whey which is believed to be even faster absorbing and more bioavailable but it's a lot more expensive given the fact that regular way is already over 96% bioavailable and there's no scientific data showing that hydrolyzed whey will absorb even faster than regular isolate I recommend saving your money and sticking with isolate if you're lactose intolerant I recommend an egg protein powder because of its high bioavailability and if you want a plant-based protein source you should get one that includes multiple plant-based sources like a mix of pee and rice to get a more balanced amino acid profile the last supplement that you may want to look into if you're in a cold climate is vitamin D and the reason is because most people don't get enough vitamin D and daily especially in cold climates your body normally gets a vitamin D from the Sun but if you don't get enough sun exposure you probably don't have optimal levels if you're deficient in vitamin D your testosterone levels will be impacted in a very negative way so if you don't get much sunshine you may want to consider adding this relatively cheap supplement into your

nothing better than big weights on the big stage in a big pressure situation here at the 2019 Reebok CrossFit Games event 8 a 1 rep max clean it's in a latter form but here's the twist one person lifts at a time on the floor all eyes are on you chase I cannot imagine what that feels like we just had two of the best Olympic lifters in the world with us this is similar to that but now we're talking CrossFit style right you're gonna have people screaming in your face to get these lists I the only thing I am disappointed is that I don't get to be on the floor to listen to this crowd and watch these lip path leads take on this event and we appreciate our media partners CrossFit for providing us with these image bytes via their world feet and I look I can't imagine the nerves I get nervous enough with my dog watches me look I don't know what it would be like having tens of thousands of people sitting there waiting for you to pick up a barbell here's the thing though is there's something about being in front of a crowd with a single lift every time I've PR to live which is few and far between it's it's not like a petition right and and there's if you handle it the right way but you got something like a clean it'd be different I would say if it was the snatch because that it's so technical there's so much room for error let's a clean you could fight man you get a stand pull get your elbows around if you can get close to that people are gonna do some I think you're gonna see some amazing things from these athletes especially when they're going one at a time  Tiye to me is your overall leader we just spoke with an Olympian here on the set she was an Olympian in weightlifting in 2016 for Australia at the Rio Summer Games she is used to this type of event and coming off that last event I can only imagine how charged up she is to put an exclamation point on the end of the day we started 215 pounds for the women and then we work our way up every time you make a lift you advance the next one when you miss a lift you move to the 195 pound bar and you complete as many deadlifts as you can I'm sorry biz five reps for time that's a tie breaker as quickly as you complete five reps on the deadlift at 195 once you miss a lift but 215 pounds is the opening weight for the women and now you shredded that's not the men's opening wait two 15s and save so I would last two rounds and then be doing some deadlifts this is the lifting order to Amanda Barnhart who did well in the speed clean-and-jerk ladder last year won the event she's going to start things off followed by Anna Frye ku overall leader Tia to me we'll get to wait and see what happens before she tasted the floor so here comes Amanda Barnhart tenth overall now after several events as she had a tough event in the last one you know we're talking earlier she might be dealing with a little bit of an ankle injury pegboards were a struggle for her last year she's sure that up a little bit I want to correct something the tiebreak is a clean tie break it is not a deadlift so it's five reps Queen not deadlift so let's make that clear to everybody that's insane so 215 is easy for a man to barber [Music] [Applause]  what's really fun about this is that it's kind of like weightlifting limbo instead of the bar slowly getting lower and lower and we go one at a time those weights are increasing and increasing and I can only imagine is standing in line getting next to call it up on a platform for these lifts Anna frag ku is next she is in 9th place overall 420 total points 215 pounds on the bar  my couch is the squat clean that that will count and she will move on to 220  franku walking off the floor and we have a treat for you ladies and gentlemen as Terry Helga daughter gets out to the lifting platform we are joined now by coach Mike Burgener gonna be with us for the rest of this event and for the men coach how are you man I'm doing really great how are you I'm doing fantastic now that you're here yeah this is gonna be a blast I love this this is a great event right here this has got to remind you a lot of what you're used to and we live you got the dishes yeah it's awesome you know here's the thing I've always said is that you know you kind of milk the snatches but you win with the clean-and-jerk turi Helga daughter will miss her first attempt [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  and held it on a whim and that is the effective crowd so much of this stuff is about motivation and getting within yourself to really make it happen and she pulled deep within there to make that happen here comes Bethany Chadron now at 215 pounds you prepared athletes for events like this will you tell them before they go out there on the platform now just you know do what you've learned all along don't make it too simple don't make it too complex to get up there and clean the way to 15 for shad burger  Schaben struggling to get out of the hole won't be able to do it  a little regulations would attempt it again love the way she moves your feet that's where you get your speed from but it might be a little wide to come out of that yep no more didn't have enough left in the tanks of Bethenny's chat was gonna bow out after 2:15 and she'll go for the tie break later on at 195 pounds we're down there now nine athletes before we even cleared the first barbell  here comes Haley Adams making her rookie debut here at the individual competition at the CrossFit Games I can't overstate it enough an 18 year old out there in the top ten and she will not be able to make that first attempt the crowd wants him to go for it again looks like she had a good pull on that she had a great pool but you know she has no leg drive right now it's all about speed and timing she's got to build get that leg drive going and really and truly that bar is high enough for her to pull herself into the front squat position she's not mentally ready for hailey Adams the bow out we're down to eight athletes left as she will be doing the tiebreaker at 195 later on here comes Katherine Davis daughter who has been working her way up the leaderboard got into the top ten in event six moved up to fifth overall in event seven it's actually a big event for her because clean isn't necessary her biggest strength between the two lists [Applause] no problem for captain Davis on her she will advance to 220 pounds now we work our way into the top four athletes in the overall standings here comes Kerry Pierce fourth overall with 534 points just seven points back of Jamie green so she could be jamie green in this eventual move back into third  [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  2:15 for peers and she has trouble getting out of the hole that Barb's just way in front of her center of gravity was olive oil a bit more balanced and she's got it 10 seconds for Pierce he's gonna make another run at 2:15 [Applause] [Music] as she won't be able to complete that list so Kerry Pierce will bow out at 2:15 and now we're down to seven that's good news for Jamie Greene because Kerry Pierce is directly behind her in the overall standing so Jamie Greene that she can make this lift will add to her lead over fourth place Kerry Pierce  2:15 for Green was out of balance nicely Kristen Jota up next second overall  576 total points 45 back of the\u00c3\u00a1-- to me after 2 mese win in events 7  and Holton will stick that very nice lift nice and strong smooth good leg drive pull himself into that punch spot beautifully one lifter remains here at 2:15 and that is your overall leader Tia to me she is my favorite March up to the box was over any other athlete in the field I remember her coming out for the Olympics up to that clean injury it was amazing get out of her way  to 1542 me [Applause] that's a power car yes she's just warming up the old lady that is the beauty of her being able to go through her patterns right before she lives and addresses the bar it's the same every single time if you watch him she's got time she addresses the bar the same goes up there very confidently and puts a lot of acceleration on the bar unbelievable message loud and clear they're from TIA to me now in the tiebreak from the athletes who missed the 215 pound bar they'll step up to 195 pounds and they'll have to clean it five times as quickly as they possibly can  that'll get going in one minute Kerry Pearson Haley Adams chalking up to get ready for that test the Haley Adams really struggled with 215 and she's about 20 fewer pounds on the bar but this will be order of finish with five reps at 195 and this is the big deal because this is 10 points apiece right off how they separate each other these are spots be spots 8 through 10 and 4 carry up here if it's a very big deal that's huge because Kerry fierce right now in fourth place overall try not to fall out of the top 5 [Applause]  ten seconds  survive [Applause] they're underway Kerry Pierce Bethy shattered in the middle of them Haley atoms closest to the camera five reps and 195 what did you like about that oh  yeah I mean you know notice that she's pulling the bar out she was trying to get low by throwing her feet out she's trying to most of the bar of it he's wide 18 years old you taught by Hale yeah there you go right Kerry Pierce you can see the leg strength that you know starting to be compromised a little bit right said Haley she's young and she's I'm sure that it's a little bit of a sure get there how is she'll definitely get to here South III shad Verne back on the barbells Haley Alex continues to recovered I think if you could combine carries pull with chaperons cash  it's that oh my god she is so strong good technique and Pierce will finish in eighth place and see how the battle over that night a 20-point save Bethany shad when you hit that pit up for Hayley Adams at this point that's a coach if I can be there I just telling us stuff yeah yummy why waste energy it's boring you're not gonna beat Bethany right you're gonna get the same place whether you get two more lifts or one correct and you have an opportunity to not injure yourself moving forward we saw the whole another day of competition [Applause]  Chadbourne will make that so she will take knife in the event and Haley Adams will take ten  [Applause]  let me chat with kari pearson Haley Adams their days are now finished and they will turn their attention to Sunday but we still have business to tend to as seven women remain Amanda Barnard who powerclean to 15 now steps up to 220 those borderline muscled clean what she did it out bar on the first round  oh really Oh 220 good for a man to Barnhardt oh yeah if I was sitting in the chairs I'd look left and right like so second place Wow beautiful lifts a lot of leg strength there guys Anna Frank ooh coming up next she was ninth place overall making her first career appearance here at the cross at games she has 420 total points and now stepping up to the 220 pound bar [Applause]  Craig who will make that lift since she stays alive we'll move on to 225 7 lifters remain here on the second bar belt  hurry Helga daughter had to fight through 2:15 now she steps up to 220 it's only a five pound increase from the first one and I think getting in just a little better position has a dramatic effect on standing up out of a hole [Applause]  helmet on or under it and not able to stand it up just 15 seconds left to make another attempt here comes the crowd getting behind tauriello go Dada [Applause] and it will go for turi Hilger daughter so she will bow out at 2:20 and we are now down to six lifters left I'm really impressed with the fact that she came back that quick he's still got underneath the bar she's got great speed great leg drive but she just needs to get her leg strong Melissa the old back to the squat rack a lot of them captain Dave is on right now at 220 this place overall coming into the event no problem for captain David sorry nice technique  [Applause]  Jamie Greene's third place overall [Applause]  [Music]  Wow Jamie Green was in that and she will move on as the weight will increase the t25 on the next barbell  here comes Kristen Holton who currently sits in second place overall 35 points up on Jamie Green who sits in third and 45 points back of Tia to me who is our overall leader  and Halton will hit that and she moves on in between her and Jamie Greene she seemed a bit more balanced at the bottom of the receiving position where I think like five more pounds for greens I'm getting a little too on the toes right remember it's all about balance coming out of that hole - if that bar is a little bit in front of you it's really good to be much every inefficient coming out of the hole there should be no problem I would predict here but Never Say Never if you know how it's gonna go out on the limb yeah look at that oh my gosh - wait for toots well I mean every time I see these fittest woman women on earth do this I still edge marvel at their strength and skill but if you watch their hips the hips go up right the hips go upwards the bar go goes up if the hips don't go all the way up the bars gonna go out a little bit that is such a beautiful lift and she's very efficient with her body and create an acceleration on that barbell that standard we're down to six that we now move to 225 pounds as Treehugger daughter will not have to do a tiebreaker she's the only woman who failed on that barbell so she will take seventh in the event  these other women left in the field and Amanda Barnhart followed by Frank P Davis daughter green pulta em to me and that is the order in which we will proceed as you move through this events the 8th event of the 2019 Reebok CrossFit Games and that woman Amanda Barnhart could really use an event win right now ten plays overall coming into this event 386 total points just put that in perspective Tia to me your overall leader has 621 let's see if Amanda Barnhart decides that you might need to squat this one I don't think so but you never know like save the legs for when you need a exactly 225 for a man to Barnhart well yeah okay and no problem very efficient he is looking pretty doggone good I think we're this one to me yeah yeah now that's gonna be interesting to see what time to ever stay put between the additional weight jumps between the two  and a frag coup up next 225 pounds on the bar frag goo coming in at 9th place overall I felt like she had a good last lift it's just kind of gonna depend on what the weights end up stopping her  it's quick another bar outstanding nicely done uses the energy of the bar to help her out of their squat that was very very nice I also like the way these guys are setting up with their hips right underneath the are the feet bite underneath the hips to get more leg drive that creates a lot more acceleration on the bar there comes Katherine Davis daughter is so far were two for two at the 225-pound bar Davis daughter along with two weeks trying to become the first women to win three cross a Games championships this is a big lift for captioning love that look little sticky point there in the middle but Katherine Davis on it will hit 225 if you check her grip with her grip is much lighter than most of the field here and that just tells me that she really needs fast elbows to get around and then she's doing a great job she's really using her legs nicely as well the voice she's hearing is coach Mike Berger I'm sure you all are very familiar with him we really glad to have you here in the booth with us I'm Sean woodland with chase Ingram this is the eighth event of the 2019 Reebok CrossFit Games as we close out day three of competition big weights under the lights it doesn't get much better than this at the cross the games as Jamie Green steps up to 225 pounds  ten seconds 20 seconds plenty of time for Jamie greens she looks to make one more attempt at 225 [Applause] just not enough time to recover so Jamie Greene she will bow out they are down to five  if Kristin hole Tov can hit this lift pulse to Volta will increase her lead over Jamie green Volta coming in in second place overall Jamie Green right behind her in the overall standings 35 points back in third it's also huge for Katherine Davis outer when you talking about the strength event being a claim normally that would be a tough thing for catcher to do it to put herself and what would look like the top four huge for Kristen Jota there's no excuse for both athletes I mean was the last time Kristen Ulta or Katherine Davis out I got taught for and any strength event other than a snap for catching Davis out now Katherine Davis daughter will sit and watch Tia to me the final woman to lift in this round [Applause] getting the crowd behind her early here is he steps up to 225 pounds [Music] [Applause] and that was no problem for her so we are through 225 Jaime green the only woman to bow out of the competition she will finish in sixth place in the event five litters remain and we move up to 230 pounds here's what I'm really enjoying about this event different than anyone they've done at the games we've always had the speed something ladder where it rewards speed on necessarily technique right this brute strength and power we've even done ladders to a certain extent but the single lift where they get to take their time right different anything we've seen you at the games coach Sega SodaStream oh boy every just how picture-perfect it's unbelievable I mean if you if you take a look at that bar if it goes up the mid thigh then all of a sudden she does what they call the double knee bend the knees rebound she is beautifully over the bar and her legs just extend very aggressively and viciously to create acceleration on the bar as well as elevation pulls yourself into the front squat it's just outstanding and of course she's thinking that uh she's an Olympian and weightlifting right so this is her this is her it's not boring now this is her event she loves this and if you threw the jerk in there would even be better hey Amanda Barnhart steps up to 230 pounds Barnhart looking to move herself up the overall leaderboard it's just one of five litters remaining here oh yeah and that looked almost effortless and it's I mean you look offended right now I don't know if I'm impressed or I'm insulted I keep deliver the boat I'm in a glass box of emotions right I figure out how I feel about it there goes that's an ax frag to five lifters remain 230 pounds on the bar Amanda Barnhart the first lift are successful at 2:30 and now Franco and I love shifting kind of from the power athlete to the speed out of there  what kind of foot she is oh yeah she standing she is quick that quickness really helped her get out of there to get out of the home we're calling this from inside the rogue ten is Katherine Davis daughter steps up to the barbell everybody in here no one is shopping no everyone's watching the action on the big screen it's incredible don't you just love the Olympic lifts it's fantastic as they're outside sweating your butt off got some air conditioning in here for you I had a giant screen davidsdottir at 2:30 four three four three two lifters remaining talk me through the double bounce there double bounce is like you know we practiced that in training actually when you do one during a quarter front squats in order to learn to receive that barred to put energy on the end of the bar that will help you come out of their squad if you got to practice that movement it just doesn't happen oh and I'm sure that she's been heavy enough in the front squat to have to practice that double knee that double balance in there we call them one and a quarter front squats comes Kristen Volta at 230 pounds  look at Chris Volta trying the same thing as davidsdottir butthole - unable to get out of the hole plenty of time but you wonder how much that took out of it one more attempt to hold won't be able to get it - hope is going to bow out at 2:30 we're down to four athletes this girl is really strong and I love it or if because her work ethic was just phenomenal and really uses every bit of energy from her body of it she's a champion Tia to be stepping up to 230 pounds of final lifter to go here on this weight she sets up the same every single time follows this thing [Applause] [Music] an easy day for Tia to me Kristen Hulka the only one to be eliminated on the 230 pound barbell we moved the 235 Holton will take fifth overall in the event and that'll be good for 60 points for her so she will pick up points on Jaime green she'll had about 10 points to her lead look at Anna Frank who was 230 nicely done notice how she brought her hips back under the bar to help her get out of that front squad it's outstanding and now one more look at captain David's daughter who did the double bounce out of the bottom of that squat Ashley bangs her hips port under the bar to help her get out of there four women remain Amanda Barnhart and a frag who dig katrin davidsdottir and Tia to me as we now move to 235 pounds [Music]  Amanda Barnard up first this is the fifth barbell that these women have faced  Barnard at 2:35  right to work and no whatsoever but now Chase is just laughing I think that's our yawn in the middle I swear to you Oh contests going on here guys yeah a barn hurting - we were just throwing some aiming on each other right now here comes Ana Franco this gal really impresses me I mean she is tiny but a dynamite type of body right there right she's very quick she can catch this the right way she might be able to come out of it but I think it's going to be a challenge here's Franco at 235 won't be able to stand up she has plenty of time but with these heavier weights that just takes a lot out of it you don't have a lot of time to recover this girl is here comes the crowd to help [Applause] the frag who won't be able to hit that so she will drop out we're down to three [Applause]  this is gonna be big for Kathy because if she can make this it's not just the finishing place that she'll get by double but she might have a hard time with a 195 against frack now well Korea the four women she's chasing have already bowed out through 35 to David solder says stay with a little bit longer looked like she had it had been lost it forward  let's see if the crowd can get it through this left to 35 or more tempted Ava's daughter huh come on can't get out of the hole so David jogging will bow out which means gonna have a tie break between her and frag kou we're down to two and the two that we thought would be left at this point Amanda Barnhart and Tia tui but to me has yet to make a run into 35  [Applause]  [Music]  no crime in 42 weeks we're down to two me and Barnard right Ellen I would be frakkin with davidsdottir for the heavyweight title fight will begin here as we move up to 240 pounds I'd say 50/50 on it and say it's like what do they just hit a gentlemen's agreement to 15 then I stop messing around with some weight man both of these are great as they very good Olympic weightlifters two different styles for it right I mean God my heart is just amazing she's strong powerful now the winner of this tie break will take third place and that'll be good for 80 points fourth place will receive 70s Katherine Davis daughter is something she really really can use yes getting an extra 10 points here at the tail-end when she's trying to charge yourself back up sitting in fifth place this is going to be a big tiebreaker catch a 70 points back of Kerry Pierce she's going to be able to cut into that lead pretty significantly here  five reps at 195  standby  here we go - thank you hits the first David's Osmocote Mac on the barbell strike go through - just ahead of Dave is on now 3 for Frank ooh and that'll bounce David's out a two three fourth attempt with Frank ooh Davis daughter with her fourth attempt that one more remains for Hannah Franco she looks to take third place and captain Davies on crack smooth will get up and over and Anna Frankie will finished third in the event and Davis out who's going to take for [Applause] dr. Davis honor and crew captain spirit is going to finish up anyway get herself across the finish line and day three done for those two competitors then we are now down to the final two it's Amanda Barnhart and Tia to be painted here hide you buddy but I'm going to package a gale up in here rub my hands together real hard I would adopt these two girls for weight eventually start for me to keep my mouth shut I bought a yell and scream form right and it's just amazing see many business 40 now here comes Amanda Barnhart [Applause]  just stop it I'm just stop it come on easy for a handlebar hard that yeah how high that bars going I'm sure that I can get it she would be power cleaning I guarantee that is amazing I'm just happy when that bar gets off the ground oh happy to deadlift that oh yeah exactly well wait you become again is really even happy to look at it so Teochew he steps up to 242 240 pounds and she will widen her lead on Kristin halter the question is now can she win this event to me we'll hit that let's go to 245 I'm saying it's the first time Tia's look significantly faster out of the hole than Amanda house it's still easy for both of them right at Tia's speed isn't isn't slowing down  verse ta2 we can do in this event the second place and that was good for 90 points as we take one more look and Amanda Barnhart now to B's attempt a good old double me being there coming up like me the only downside and coach maybe feet better to answer this question than I am that Amanda pulls it so high yet she's still catching a full squat it's almost crashing on her a little bit yeah you always want to remember when you're coaching athletes that you make them go to the bar and not the hole when you go to the hole too soon the bar can crash on you and then you've got all kinds of problems that the bar can come out of position so you always go meet the bar then you go to the hole you never want to go to the hole and then the bar crashes on so fast elbows notice also that Barnhardt's grip is much more narrow so that's gonna be a harder for her to get the elbows around I like a wider grip I actually like the grip of the daughters because they really go right and they come back to Barb very quickly obviously the legs link needs to be there a little bit more and both of these girls have leg strength it's going to come down to the very end I'm telling you they're both great well thank you ideas the one that I just got very good legs from failing Barnhart stepping up to 245 with two he wins his eventually almost doubled her lead over crystal hold up Amanda Barnard who came in a tenth place overall that's gonna change after this event 245 245 guys that's amazing at 111 kilos  now to meet up next even if to me finishes second in this event she will increase her lead over second place Kristin Holt abite 30 points she's in a really good spot right back [Music] to me stepping up to 245 we only have three barbells remaining  I say keep going why not  that's about the first time we've seen maybe a minor fault in the form but it still goes up pretty easily my leg strength is definitely there the back collapsed a little bit on the receiving position so she's gonna be aware that otherwise that could pull her forward and she have a harder time getting out of those getting out of the hole now we move up to 250 pounds how much time are they giving them in between the lifts  there's about 30 or 45 seconds that's weak Amanda for reset with a minute as you mentioned last time to me look a little faster I think this time Barnhart may have looked a little better to do  it looks pretty doggone good both of them man they said it is a little wasn't much but at those weights that's a little extra inch for it makes the world it makes all the difference in the yeah I also like the fact that these guys are weighing whoa wait looking shoe they can get more Drive against my ground here [Music]  2:54 Amanda Barnard she and tu2 we the only two athletes remaining has no problem with that and it's kind of over time about earlier is that you know for Barnhart where she was pulling it so high but is coming down on her I think almost the weight increase where she's not able to pull it as high as actually working to her benefit you know every pool is like a power claim we were even eating a full clean you pull it like a power clean and you would like to party and everything you meet the bar where it is very very strong ladies do you to me now to 250 she's gonna be big furrows she come back with a good technique [Music]  to me double bounce it'll work for and she stays alive now we move on to 255 the final weight is 260 well maybe get some more weights up hell I see them there right there  with lips I think when someone hits a lip is this way that is all you really can see this boy I really like the way barn horse case flat-footed for as long as possible and drives against the platform as long as she can create an acceleration on the bar that really looked like a great lift community I had to guess this girl could probably plans her 275 qadi he's very powerful on a fresh day well that's a really good point of it they've been through seven events Lascaux right we may need up 200 pistols yes yeah they combined all the pulling as well and Mary  we're at the 255 pound barbell as Amanda Barnhart is looking to really improve her position on the overall leaderboard she came into this event in tenth place overall that is gonna change she can rack up one other points in an event win here 255 pounds  [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  that's just a Miss focus that was so unbelievably easy do you see the hips and help my that vog half way out there I was like oh yeah I know probably oh you got that 255 is good for Barnhart and now Tia to me you think some of those little slip-ups just come to maybe putting more effort than you need to this because you think the weights getting up a little bit I just think that it's the focus and concentration just a little bit gets out of the way and you might have what I always say as a brain fart yeah you know she just got up you just got to stay with that there's two we first attempt to 255 we got a 260 so that's the final bar but listen just went have a tie-break got through that so this might come down to the 195 barbell if they're gonna go that I don't want it to come down to the one you just get foreign plates on there hey we're here for the entertainment to begin with just keep going we're not on a time schedule we're here for the we're here for the show and we're getting I hope they keep going why not let her look at Amanda Barnhart and that was where she had the little collapse on her oh you were talking about Xiomara crashing on on it right that one actually crashed a little bit on it got a bill and meet that bar 260 on the barbell Barnhart and to me going toe-to-toe here an event eight in the Coliseum at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison Wisconsin as we close out day three of competition for the women the men are coming up next the Macon wait you just sit down come on wait you tomorrow watching some lifted I'm with you and then you can wait I've got two great athletes here going head to head how much fun is that we got Frazier and Ali going head to head 13th round that's what I want now abandoned Barnhart will step up to 260 pounds  2:55 was the first time we saw her looked less than perfect but she still completed the lift pretty easily 264 a man - Barnhart okay there you go that's good so you put one finger up there you like fixed it okay now to you to me to step up to 260 pounds  [Music]  [Applause]  yeah okay what do we do now Dave whoa hey what will Dave Capps day do is we've got a tie we're at a bar but I didn't mean to just Dave you're right there I'm sorry mr. Castro please walk onto the platform and go this is the CrossFit Games who wants to see him keep going  wait to see what's going to happen but this is Toomey's attempt at 260 coach look at her feet - that was outstanding feet are flat she goes right through the ground push that platform away from her create a lot of acceleration all right we've got word we're gonna keep going you're welcome everyone this this just goes to show you that if you complain enough you're gonna get what you want  all right 265 although if they get to 275 I will ask them to stop here you go take that we're gonna keep going do 65 now we started at 215 the efficiency now has got to be critically really gotta be efficient I mean these are weights that I was gonna say that's a great place five years ago these are men's weights yes and now we're watching the women get to this point  [Applause]  265 pounds for a man to Barnhardt  Oh first time she's failed to lift the elbows around on this way see yes and it's the old grip this he uses here  [Music] and she won't be able to hit it but Barnhart at worse will finish second and if you can hear behind me that's the crowd here in the road tent up applauding her and she's hearing it from the crowd as they come to their feet to salute her that was a hell of a show if I think back to cinco's wasn't the women's dead lift wait close to 265 maybe right you may be right about that that sounds about right anyway so here's to me for her second straight win if she hits it she wins if she misses we go to the tiebreak  [Applause] to me for the win and it's two for to me 100 points and two straight up wins for the defending person games  there go the goosebumps  Oh Kevin's examples wrong  and as a result Tiye to me will nearly double her lead over christen Volta in the overall standings as she takes her second straight event win 200 points here in the Coliseum  one day remains and Tia to me it's tearing history in the face right now T has got some phrase to face going on Neos train with him dead serious cuz I get psyched up that were she gets out throws that she kept but also the consistency of the lead up i I just love the way that she addresses the bar that she's got a routine that she follows good leg Drive feet against the ground comes right out of that hole look at the hips go forward here to help support the way he's a frickin champion  what is incredible show and she knew it  Tiye to me to straight for the defending two-time champion and Tia to me has the overall lead going into the final day of competition at the 2019 Reebok CrossFit Games what a show here in the Coliseum the crowd is still fired up at you making that final lift at 265 when it comes right down to just you and Amanda and your rep for rep how do you approach the barbell and given the fact that you're such a veteran but this is such a unique situation oh I mean a mint is really strong but every lift you just have to do you don't worry about what other people are doing and I think I did just that absolutely you did now moving forward still a lot of unknown in the competition we've seen a lot already but there's a lot that could be coming down the pipeline what are you hoping for just for a good competition so already being so great and thank you so much to all the supporters these guys are thank you wins both events inside the Coliseum at the Alliant Energy Center and as a result her overall lead over Kristin Volta has nearly double the tia to me it's 265 Amanda Barnhart failed to 265 and then it seems like ages ago when we were watching the Hannah Frank who got her David's out her and Kristen Holt Olaf so multiple finished 5th in the event Tia to me great day number three one day remains in one day stands between her and her third CrossFit Games championship we'll take a break we'll come right back here we'll get to set up for the men's event coach Berger is going to stick around we hope you do we'll be back on the road higher the game", "eo34-cw3DRE": "abs are made in the kitchen right wrong abs are built with resistance and gradual progression like any other muscle and like all other muscles removing the unwanted fat that covered them up is what allows them to show if you look at an Anatomy chart it's clear to see that you're born with abs in the same way you're born with biceps triceps and every other muscle in the human body they may not be impressive but they're there so whenever a so-called fitness professional tells you that abs are made in the kitchen do me a favor and punch him in the face likewise whenever some potbelly power lifter tells you that squatting and dead lifting is enough to build a solid set of six-pack ABS punch him in the face - you see the six-pack or rectus abdominis is a superficial muscle of the core the key word here is muscle like any other muscle the rectus abdominis can be hypertrophied meaning you can build bigger more developed abdominals in the same way you can build bigger pecs however just like you can't build a massive chest with nothing more than some push-ups you won't develop neck-snapping abs from sitting in your room doing crunches every night if you want deep abs that pop there are two things that have to happen for starters you've got to understand the anatomy and physiology of the core once you understand what muscles are involved and more importantly what function they're responsible for choosing the right exercises and how to perform them more effectively becomes obvious second once you've got your two to three key movements focus on progression if you're performing the right exercises while gradually increasing the load your abs will grow in this video I want to go over the basic anatomy of the core and its functions and then I want to go over the only three exercises you need for building deeper abs that pop the anatomy of the core the superficial muscles of the core consists of the external obliques the internal obliques the rectus abdominis and the transverse abdominis acting together these muscles form a firm wall that protects your internal organs and they help to maintain proper posture they also aid in exhaling as well as to increase intra-abdominal pressure that said the actual functions of the core muscles are quite simple first they're responsible for stabilization of the spine thus whenever we're flexing our abs to stabilize our posture during heavy compound lifts we aren't just strengthening our core we're also building the muscles involved second and more obvious the superficial core muscles are responsible for flexion of the spine and think about a crunching motion where we're bending forward to flex the ABS and although the obliques are involved in stabilization and flexion of the spine as well they also play a larger role in lateral flexion of the spine as well as rotation of the trunk and swai we see gym goers performing endless amounts of side bends and bicycle crunches now that you understand what muscles you're targeting and what movement they're involved in it's time to go over the best exercises for building a deeper sharper 6-pack heavy compound the first and most important movement for building deeper abs that pop are heavy compound lifts be it the squat deadlift overhead press barbell row or any other multi joint movement that requires stabilization of the spine these exercises alone assuming you're progressing to heavier loads over time will produce enough tension to hypertrophy the superficial muscles of the core let's look at a traditional back squat an exercise where you're loading up the bar placing it on your back and utilizing core strength to stabilize the spine in order to maintain an upright position although this is primarily a lower body movement there's no way you could go from squatting 135 pounds to 315 pounds without sufficient increases in core strength when you're adding weight to these lifts you're not just overloading the target muscles you're overloading the core muscles as well and because progressive overload is the main pathway by which we build muscle it's not hard to see how make heavy compound lifts the focal point of your training will result in more developed abs a weighted crunching movement the next movement we must include in our training if the goal is well-developed abs is a movement where we can flex the spine under tension not only is it important to take a muscle through a full range of motion so that we can fully lengthen the muscle as well as achieve the shortest contraction but we must also ensure that we're gradually introducing a new stress this is why I'd suggest including the cable crunch as your primary movement for your direct ab work not only does this exercise allow you to fully flex and extend the spine but it also allows you to increase the load with little risk of injury on top of that this movement won't just build the superficial muscles it'll increase core strength as well making it easier and safer to load up on those heavy compound lives when it comes to performing the cable crunch there are a few things people get wrong first a lot of people use their arms for momentum to help pull the weight down this shifts the load off the abdominals and makes it a less effective exercise secondly too many people perform this exercise by just flexing their hip and not their spine you need to flex your spine to get a concentric contraction of your abdominals otherwise it'll just be an isometric exercise for your abs to perform this exercise safely and effectively start with the rope close to your head knees on the floor arms locked in place and your spine lengthen crunch over and bring your elbows to your knees to fully contract the abdominals control the weight on the way up and initiate the crunch once you're back in the starting position body rotation exercise between the heavy compound lifts and weighted crunching your core is pretty much covered but if you want to create the biggest visual impact you may want to add a more oblique dominant exercise according to the research exercises that require constant abdominal stabilization as well as body rotation generate the most muscle activity in the Bleek's out of the 13 exercises researchers tested the captain's chair and bicycle crunch showed to be the most effective for this particular region of the core if I had to choose one the captain's chair with some body rotation would be an easy choice not just because it showed slightly better muscle activity but more so due to the fact that it's easy to load if you can perform this exercise for 15 reps using proper form add some resistance by simply placing a dumbbell between your feet continue using the same amount of weight until you're able to perform 15 repetitions with proper form and then increase the resistance by another 5 pounds and repeat this process gradually over time to ensure continuous progress now that you know exactly what exercises you should be performing let's quickly go over ab training frequency like the calves the abs can take a bigger beating than larger muscle groups thus a higher frequency of training is acceptable but you must also keep in mind that you're already training the ABS a great deal by simply including heavy compound lifts throughout the week so when should you train your abs directly the simple answer is when you can I would HIGHLY discourage that you take an extra trip to the gym in order to fit in direct ab work instead I would recommend throwing it in at the end of your workout as you see fit for best results I'd aim to add some direct ab work 2 to 3 times per week while focusing on progression did you find this video helpful if so click the like button below as it'll help out

[Laughter] [Music]", "N-yALPEpV4w": "Translator: Rubik Cheng Reviewer: Amanda Chu thank you all When i was young My parents often take me to California for camping There are various places such as beaches, forests or deserts Some people say there is no life in the desert But my parents asked me to observe these wild animals around: Badger, eagle or tortoise, etc. Once we were camping Found a scorpion baby showing its sting At the moment I thought, it was so cool How could there be something so cute but so dangerous After college, I moved to California Embarked on some environmental-related activity plans Participated in the work to save the nation's last redwood forest And prevent radioactive waste storage in the desert. Shortly after turning 30 I decided to spend my whole life To address climate change I worry about global warming Will eventually destroy the natural environment that people try to protect To solve this problem, I think it \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technically simple. Popularization of electric vehicles with solar panels on all roofs, etc. The biggest problem is policy Therefore, I assist the nation's largest labor union and the largest environmental group to jointly organize an alliance Our proposal is a $ 300 billion renewable energy investment plan The idea is not just to prevent climate change And in a fast-growing high-tech field Create millions of jobs In 2007, our efforts paid off Barack Obama, then presidential candidate, embraces our vision Between 2009 and 2015 U.S. invests $ 150 billion in clean energy technologies, including renewable energy But at the beginning we encountered some problems First, the cost of electricity from rooftop solar panels is twice that of solar power plants And solar and wind power plants Requires a large area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039land to install solar panels and fans And build a huge power transmission system To send electricity from the countryside to the city These things are often affected by local communities And strong resistance from conservation biologists They worry that wild birds and other animals will be persecuted At the time, many people worked hard to solve this problem in terms of technology. A big challenge is the intermittent nature of solar and wind power They generate electricity only 10% to 30% of the year But there are still some proposals Think of the dam as a giant battery Meaning when the sun is exposed, when the wind is blowing The motor beats the water up and stores it When you need electricity, this water is sent to the turbine generator set. It doesn't seem so worrying when it comes to wildlife Domestic cats kill billions of birds every year Compared to only hundreds of thousands of birds died of fans I was thinking When scaling up solar and wind power Most of those problems can be solved with future advanced technology But years passed These problems still exist and are getting worse California is very committed to the development of renewable energy But plans to transform the dam into a large battery Not many completed Some are just geographical issues The dam must have eligible terrain to be transformed Even if eligible Still need a lot of money to achieve Not to mention other issues like water demand for irrigation Perhaps the most serious problem is California river and reservoir water Increasingly scarce and unstable due to climate change To prevent stability from affecting the overall power generation system We must stop delivering electricity from solar power plants to cities Because there are too many now Or spend money asking neighboring states like Arizona to consume our excess solar power Otherwise it will cause the grid to be overloaded and unable to supply power Speaking of birds and domestic cats Cats don't hurt eagles, but eagles can kill cats Cats kill small and common sparrows, jay and robin These birds are not likely to become extinct Eagles and large birds Like tooth eagles, owls, and condors and other threatened and endangered species The birds killed by wind turbines Fans are one of the biggest threats to these large birds Before installing wind turbines in recent years We never put so many things in the sky Speaking of solar energy Building a solar power plant is like building a farm Must free up a lot of land to clear away the wildlife This is one of the largest solar power plants in California. Aventa Solar Power Plant To build this power plant They have to clear the desert tortoise from the entire area Drag desert tortoises and baby tortoises directly out of the cave Put in truck and transport to captivity Many died there Recently it is estimated that about 6,000 birds are killed every year They are on fire above the solar power plant Fall to the ground Over time, I gradually realized Any technological development It \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to let the sun shine constantly and let the wind blow constantly You can only make solar panels cheap You can only make the fan bigger Sun and wind are so inefficient And in order to produce enough electricity You have to use a large area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039land In other words, the main problems of renewable energy are not technical. In the natural environment To deal with these unstable issues And the huge impact of these environments Obviously comes at a great economic cost We have heard too much in recent years News of solar panel and wind turbine prices falling But integrate all unstable power generation systems into the grid The cost is still considerable You can see it from California As the price of solar panels and wind turbines has fallen sharply What we are seeing is that the price of electricity has increased 5 times more than in other parts of the country. This is not our problem You can see the same situation happens in Germany Germany is a world leader in solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies Their electricity price has risen by 50% after vigorously promoting renewable energy You might think, fight climate change We have to spend more on energy I used to think so But look at the French example In terms of clean, zero-emission power generation France is twice as much as Germany But electricity prices are almost half that of Germany How did this happen? You may have guessed the answer 75% of France's electricity comes from nuclear energy Nuclear energy is much more reliable than renewable energy And generating electricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Operates 90% of the year We see this happening all over the world for example There is a natural experimental method for more than 40 years Comparing nuclear and solar applications Shows that solar and wind power use is slightly more expensive than nuclear power Generating only half as much nuclear power What does this mean? I think the most significant findings so far are: If Germany had spent $ 580 billion on nuclear energy instead of renewable energy, Now they are 100% electricity and all transportation energy Will be clean energy You may ask a very reasonable question: Is nuclear energy safe? How do you deal with nuclear waste? These are very reasonable questions Here are the results of more than 40 years of scientific research Recent research Was performed by the UK\\'s authoritative medical journal \"Stab tick\" They find nuclear energy to be the safest It's not hard to understand World Health Organization says About 7 million people die from air pollution a year Nuclear energy does not cause air pollution Climate scientist James Hanson calculates So far, nuclear energy has saved nearly two million lives Even wind power is more deadly than nuclear power In this photo are two maintenance workers in the Netherlands Shortly after the photo was taken, one of them fell dead to avoid the fire. The other was engulfed by the fire What about the environmental impact? I think there is a very simple way to understand Uranium is the source of energy for nuclear power plants Its energy density is very high Uranium the size of this magic cube Can produce all the energy you need in your life The conclusion is that such a large area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039land is not required for large-scale power generation You can put the Aventa solar power plant I just mentioned Compared with California's last nuclear power plant, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant To produce the same electricity Solar power plants spend 450 times more land area than nuclear power plants You need to add 17 solar power plants like Aventa Will generate the same amount of power as the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant In addition, solar energy reduces the reliability of power generation What about in terms of raw material collection, scrap and material throughput? This has also been fully studied The results are Solar panels require 17 times more material than nuclear power plants These materials include cement, glass, concrete, metal Fuels for all nuclear power plants are also included In the end, through the entire power generation process Not much waste from nuclear power This room can hold all the waste produced by the Swiss nuclear power project Nuclear waste is the only waste from nuclear power generation It is kept safely without additional social costs Electricity generated by other methods The discharged waste has entered nature These may be pollutants or solid waste We thought solar power was clean But the truth is we have no plans To dispose of waste solar panels after 20 or 25 years Many experts are very worried about solar panels and electronics waste Shipped to poor African or Asian countries together for disassembly Workers will be exposed to a large number of hazardous toxic elements Contains lead, cadmium and chromium Because they are elements, toxicity never degrades I think we all know Nuclear power is really a very powerful energy source Sunlight is scattered and weak This is why we need to have such a large area To collect sunlight and wind In the latest version of \"Blade Runner\" science fiction The beginning is a gloomy post-apocalyptic scene California's desert is completely covered by solar panels No one will be surprised by this scene I think all this makes us can't help but ask a disturbing question: To save the climate, do we destroy the environment? Interestingly, over the past few hundred years Humans are actually trying to eliminate so-called high-density fuels And transfer to high energy density fuels For example, switch from wood and animal manure to coal, oil, natural gas, uranium This is a phenomenon since ancient times Some poor countries are now gradually phasing out wood and dry manure fuel Generally speaking, this is a good thing When you stop using wood as a fuel source Forests have a chance to grow wild animals before they can return to nature When you stop burning wood at home You don't need to inhale these toxic gases anymore When you start using coal, oil, gas and uranium as the main source of energy The potential opportunity to completely eliminate air pollution will emerge There is a problem with nuclear energy Most people readily embrace the conversion from polluting energy to clean energy And converting from low energy density to high energy density energy Nuclear power is very unpopular for many historical reasons As a result, I and many others may have said it in the past \"To address climate change All kinds of clean energy must come in handy. \" The problem is that this is not correct remember? I mentioned France earlier France uses nuclear energy to get most of its electricity If France increases the scale of solar and wind power They have to drastically reduce the amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy The reason is that in order to make the grid able to cope with the variable solar and wind power They need to use more natural gas Think of it this way: Nuclear power plant's power output is difficult to maneuver at any time But the management of the power grid is like controlling the size of the gas fire. Can be switched on and off at any time Oil and gas companies certainly understand this. We all see them investing millions of dollars in recent years to advance solar and wind power This raises another challenging question: Where a lot of nuclear energy is used Nuclear and hydropower provide half of the power grid If we move to other renewable energy sources such as solar energy or wind power, Will actually increase carbon emissions I think the best way is to tell the truth This is what many scientists are doing I mentioned earlier Hundreds of thousands of birds die each year due to fans What I didn't mention is that at least one million bats are killed by fans every year Many bat researchers have proposed such results Especially this gray fluffy bat It is a migratory bat Because those wind turbines are constantly expanding Is facing an extinction crisis Not just wind, but also solar Scientists who were involved in the construction of the Aventa Solar Power Plant And the people who prepared the land in the early stage of execution stood out Some of them wrote: \"Everyone knows that finding a new home for a desert tortoise is impossible When you walk in front of a bulldozer When crying and clearing the animals and cactus It is difficult to agree with this plan. \" And now we can see these phenomena all over the world In my hometown california We buried a lot of natural gas on the side of the mountain To compensate for unstable solar and wind power But an air leak happened The leaked natural gas is equivalent to the exhaust gas emitted by 500,000 cars during their lifetime Recently in Germany Some protesters try to thwart new coal mining plans This will destroy the ancient forest of Hambach Just to get more coal mines It's all about scrapping nuclear power and expanding solar and wind power The good news is People still care about our natural environment and value these phenomena Last year in South Korea Citizens jury weighs these different issues Considered for several months They have to decide whether to scrap nuclear Still want to continue to use and expand the scale 40% of them support the expansion of nuclear power at first After a few months of evaluation 60% of supporters voted in the final vote Just last week, the same phenomenon happened in Arizona Voters vote To decide whether to continue using nuclear energy Or replace nuclear energy with natural gas and solar energy Result refused to scrap nuclear to win 70 to 30 And in Europe we see the Netherlands as one of the first countries to act They announced last week To start increasing the proportion of nuclear power generation Because they recognize that they ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough energy from solar and wind To achieve the promised carbon reduction targets As we become more aware of environmental issues as big as climate change I want to make human civilization and the natural environment harmonious with renewable energy It is a natural tendency to solve problems in this romantic way But I think the truth is right here Many people begin to question past beliefs and change their minds For me, the problem is Now that we know that renewable energy cannot save the planet, Should we continue to destroy her like this?

chat with everybody and thank you for taking time out of your evening and giving the old man your ear here is really what what is transpired you know if you look back when you bought a home you went to the bank and you filled out some paperwork and one of the pieces of paper that you signed was your mortgage and it was notarized and it was recorded with peat birth deeds as Register of Deeds or clerk of County Clerk or whatever okay and the other piece of paper that you set filled out and signed was a promise and let's say you borrowed $400,000 well you signed a piece of paper will you promise to pay that man across the table or his representative four hundred thousand dollars over a period of 30 years or 20 years or whatever the term was but you signed that piece of paper and it was not notarized but it was like signing a blank cheque but it was a promise of pay which made it a negotiable instrument now when you press when you gave sign that paper you thought that the bank was going to give you $400,000 that's what you thought well when you sign that piece of paper what did they give you they give you anything yet you just signed the document and that piece of paper became an asset for that Bank it was now an asset that they owned you no longer owned it yours was a promise to pay so that asset was now $400,000 of bears and here's what they did with it they didn't give you any money yet but they took that asset and they created a bond just like you would bail your nephew out of jail they created a bond and that bond went they took it to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve gave them approximately ten times the amount of your promise to pay now let's say you promised to pay with four hundred thousand the Federal Reserve create or gave them a credit of about four million bucks now how much money have they put up they have put up absolutely zero they leveraged leveraged and the technical word for it is monetized but they leveraged your promise to pay to create four million bucks and they still had your promise to pay they kept it they just created a bond they then took your promise to pay to another party and we'll call that party a wholesaler and that wholesaler took it to what we call an aggregator or trustee and it was then sold to a trust and 95 percent of the Trust's are in New York so with sold on Wall Street well where did the money come from for this note where did it come from well the trust filed before you even applied for that note the trust filed what we call an 8k filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we'll call it the Rosato trust and they told the Securities and Exchange Commission that they were going to sell investment certificates and they were what we call mortgage-backed securities or they were called CDOs collateralized collateralized debt obligations whatever fancy to and they called it that note was that was the security for these folks to induce certificate holders or investors let's just say the folks that are listening to this phone call let's say they represent the school teachers in their area so the school teachers pension plan invested ten million dollars each into this trust that was backed by your promise to pay so they were they were given let's say 6% return on their investment but you were paying maybe 7% so the trust was earning money okay now those certificates okay that were purchased by the investors okay that money went back to the bank that you signed that promise to pay with and that's where the funds came from for you to buy your house Wow Wow listen to this for a minute that piece of paper that was never notarized traveled all around the world gathering a lot a lot of money it created four million dollars for the bank and credit on your signature it also induced a lot of school teachers pension plans or firefighters pension plans to invest into that trust they got an investment certificate and the funds came backwards to the bank and the bank then threw the title company they provided the four hundred thousand dollars to purchase the house good deal very good deal for who for the bank they got four million in credits and did a nickel out now the trustee for this trust he is provided what we call a pooling and services agreement that's his management book as his rules that's what he has to follow to comply with the SEC rules so in a pooling and services agreement there's a clause in there that says if you failed to pay your mortgage they they entered into an insurance contract so if that mortgage wasn't paid the insurance company would pay it but the money wouldn't go to you it would go to the trust only we call that a credit default swap and the insurance company is listen to this a PI G now when you got in trouble and you know you lost your job or your overtime or for whatever reason you tried to contact the bank and you got the runaround you ended up talking to this person that person submit these papers oh we lost them submit them again and all that practicals with it but you were told we can't help you until you're 90 days late everybody's heard that well guess what happened on day 91 on day 91 the insurance policy that the trustee entered into with AIG triggered a payoff and the trust received the full amount of the note regardless of how much you paid on your mortgage they got the full amount of the note so the note was insurer for 400,000 to trust got 400,000 but here's a mystery here and I'll explain it as easy as I can the Federal Reserve allowed the trust to leverage that $400,000 note 30 times so they created 30 different levels now your four thousand dollar note is purchased by other lenders along we go now let's go back to the default the AIG paid off the note when it was 91 days late so at this point who has lost any money nobody except AIG or insurers like that Sol Smith Salomon Barnum Brothers and all that stuff now someone attempts to foreclose let's say the lender that you've got know from they're going to foreclose on you or the trust is going to foreclose on you or let's say it's Wells Fargo acting as trustee for Bear Stearns trust well they're trying to steal the house because nobody has any skin in the game they've all been paid commissions and there they've been very successful in stealing houses what happened here well I sat in the fort minor's courtroom many times and I watched folks average folks lose their house in five minutes because they didn't have an idea of what to do didn't know where to go for an answer and didn't have any money now in this foreclosure arena  call it a football field in this field of litigation the only players are the consumers who have enough money to pay an attorney and what is he doing he's delaying decline so that you maybe save a couple of months of rent or mortgage payments but at the end of the game end of the day when you pull the shade down journalize up he wins a dismissal without prejudice which means the bank that is foreclosing who doesn't have any skin in the game will come back again in a month and try to pork try to foreclose him murrs are technically is Mortgage Electronic Registration system  they were formed by the banks and the met banks became members and MERS at the closing table is named as the nominee lender they take they take possession of the mortgage electronically not the hard copy but electronically MERS their theory is and was that by they being the nominee lender and having possession of the mortgage electronically they believe that the note followed the mortgage and there are some judges who don't understand this who agreed with that however the US Supreme Court in 1872 said if the note and the mortgage are separated because one secures the other if they're separated they're both null and void and to simplify it if you were going to buy my car you're not going to give me the check until I give you the title the keys to the car are one thing but the title is another thing now MERS took possession of the mortgage but they could not take possession of the note because the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that they are not a lender with that being said your loan was bifurcated that's a legal word bifurcated right at the closing but you didn't know that now that means you're tied chain of title was broken so fast forwarding ahead we simply said and this workbook that I created and I'm the only layman that I know of and I've been told us that's ever been approved by the Florida Bar to teach attorneys about this subject as subsequent we've been approved by the Georgia bar the Wisconsin bars and Nevada bar and other states to follow so that's quite an accomplishment for a little white hair old man to be able to be certified to teach attorneys what you need is a securitisation audit which follows the paper trail from the time you closed until it enters into the trust and a Bloomberg financial report that pulls out all of the financial information about the trust when you have that information and it's accompanied with an affidavit sworn under the penalty of perjury you know evidence you now have admissible evidence to the court that the note was paid off when the insurance or credit default swap was triggered well if the note was paid off who is damaged who is damaged nobody the only logical people with a claim to that house only logical people would be the insurance company that paid out the claim but now here's it is the end of my story tonight and then now open it up for questions if you have your vehicle insured by let's say Geico and you total it the Geico will write you a check for the value of the vehicle but who owns the salvage rights think about that for a minute write your question down think about it the salvage rights are owned by Geico they then part it out sell it whatever so they can minimize their losses well in the foreclosure arena the insurance company is Geico and if they paid off the certificate holders then they would have a claim to the house logical except except they insured unsecured notes remember at the closing table MERS became the nominee lender it separated the note from the mortgage the US Supreme Court says that they're separated they're both null and void well Geico insured unsecured notes because the notes that were not accompanied by the mortgage or vice versa therefore they had no claim on the wreck or the house who now so it's actually the dog dripping or a versa double dipping and triple dependent absolutely and today Geico has a big-time lawsuit against Bank of America because Geico kinda guy called my god when you get my age you can invent Wars AIG has a major lawsuit against Bank of America because Bank of America defrauded them on the quality of the loans the loans were rated triple-a by sub Standard & Poor's or Moody's or whatever when in fact they slid into that pile of loans they slid the slid in some toxic lonesome some marginal loans and Geico ended up paying based on misrepresentation Wow what a harness nest you here's what you do and I did this with Regions Bank I walked into the bank and I said to the girl I want to talk to the president the bank has dirty diapers and they really smell while he's in conference I said there's no problem I'll just drop the diapers right here in less than 30 seconds he comes out of his office and he said I overheard the conversation what's the problem I see you've got dirty diapers there's fraud in this in these loans now what do you want to do you want to litigate or you want to negotiate as they called his legal department and I said here's the proof you people have already been paid what do you want to do and it stopped all the activity in court because you had proof and that's the value of the securitisation audit and the bloomberg financial report so if I were a real estate investor I would not rely on any modification because you're dealing with someone who doesn't own the note remember remember earlier in the conversation a lawyer here in Cape Coral and the real estate broker they were partners they paid the bank one hundred and fifty six thousand dollars and Randy I think you saw the article and the bank didn't hold it so if I'm an investor how the hell do I know who owns the owns the note so the only way I can find out who owns the note so I can sit across the table and cut a deal is to flush them out of the woodwork and how do you flush them out you sue them Wow this will make a lot of enthusiasm okay the ability to walk into the bank and say to the bat to the president of Bank you have dirty diapers do you want to litigate or you do you want to negotiate and they always would rather negotiate and then it's a question of how much money they will take based on today's value so if a home had a mortgage of 400,000 is worth two hundred thousand today banks are negotiating today's value now can the individual homeowner negotiate no no because of the banks of alleged pay me in the first place", "H02YcexnEqc": "", "v_ONFix_e4k": "Translated by: Mathilde Kennis Checked by: Axel Saffran Thank you for coming. My father died on 8 February 2012. That was the day his heart stopped beating. But actually my father had died years earlier. It started with slight forgetfulness, and over time his memory failed more often and more often, and it came to the point where he no longer recognized his own children. His personality changed and he could no longer take care of himself. And... If you could make a list of everything that could happen to you, then the last on your list, at the very bottom, what you least want are Alzheimer's disease, because if you lose your memory, you lose everything. You lose everyone you ever loved. If you look at the brain of someone with that disease, you see that there are crazy structures between the brain cells. Beta-amyloid protein is derived from the cells and it piles into small meatball-like structures like this one here, on a microscopic plate. They shouldn't be there and they are a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. This disease affects nearly half of Americans in their mid-80s. You could tell your doctor: \"Okay, I don\\'t want that. What can I do to stop it?\" Your doctor will say, \"Well, it\\'s aging and genes.\" There is a gene - the APOE- [epsilon] 4 allele. If you inherited this gene from a parent, your risk tripled. If you inherited it from both parents, your risk is 10 to 15 times higher. What is the solution? Take new parents? No, I don't think so. That is not the solution. So I'm sorry: it's aging, it's the genes, period; there's nothing you can do about it, just wait for it to happen. Or maybe not. Researchers started in Chicago the Chicago Health and Aging Project. They looked at what people ate in Chicago. They made accurate reports of what hundreds of people ate, and then they began to see who, as the years passed, remained mentally clear and who developed dementia. The first thing they came up with was something I already knew as a child when I was growing up in Fargo, North Dakota. My mother had five children, each of whom ran into the kitchen with the smell of bacon. My mother then took a fork, put it in the pan and fished out the hot bacon to put them on kitchen paper to cool, and when all the bacon was out of the pan, she carefully lifted the hot pan and poured the fat into a jar for storage - that's good bacon fat, you don't want to waste that! My mother then took the pot, and she placed it not in the fridge but on a shelf, because she knew that when fat cools down, what happens with it? It's getting hard. And the fact that it is fixed at room temperature shows that bacon fat is full of saturated fat, bad fat. We have known for a long time that it raises cholesterol, and bacon fat is full of it. And by the way: the next day she spooned it again in a frying pan to bake eggs; unbelievable that none of her children died young. This is how we lived. However, bacon is not the main source of saturated fat. These are dairy products: cheese, milk, etc.; and meat gets a second place. In Chicago, some ate relatively little saturated fat, about 13 grams per day, and others ate twice as much, and the researchers just looked at who developed Alzheimer's. Shall I show the graphs? Here is the low group, and here is the high group. Those who avoided bad fat ran a fairly low risk, but who filled themselves with cheese and bacon had a risk of two, three, or even more times higher. After this, they not only looked at saturated fat, but also the fat that you find in donuts and pastries; you know them, trans fats, as indicated on the labels. They found the same pattern there. So people who avoided saturated fats and trans fats, did so in view of cholesterol and heart disease, but apparently they also have an effect on the brain. After this, Finnish researchers said, \"Wait, we dig deeper.\" There is a disease called mild cognitive impairment. You are still yourself - you manage your finances, drive the car, your friends will remember you - but you are mistaken on a regular basis, especially concerning names and words. They took over 1,000 people aged 50 years and took a closer look at their eating habits. They investigated over time who developed mild cognitive impairment. Some ate relatively little fat, some a larger amount, and they watched whose memory began to deteriorate. They found exactly the same pattern. In other words, it\\'s not just: \"Shall I get Alzheimer\\'s?\" But: \"Will I only have age-related memory problems?\" But what about that gene, that APOE [epsilon] 4 allele that you curse to Alzheimer's? They did the study and only focused on those people, and some ate relatively little fat, some ate more fat, and -- Exactly the same. In other words, if you avoid bad fats, even if you have that gene, reduces your risk of developing memory problems by 80%. And this is my most important point: genes don't determine your destiny. Let's review those protein slices. We know that there is beta amyloid, but there is also iron and copper. Metal in my brain? Yes, there is metal in food and it ends up in your brain. Now think for a moment: I have a cast-iron pan, and we had a barbecue in our yard, and a week later I remember: \"Oh... I left the pan on the picnic table, and it rained last week. \" What happened to my pan? She rusted, and that rust is oxidation. Or take a shiny new coin, will that shine forever? No, it also oxidizes. Well, iron and copper oxidize in your body, and while they do that they cause the production of free radicals. You probably already heard about it: free radicals are molecules who swim in your bloodstreams and get into your brain, and they act like sparks which burn the connections between cells. How does this happen? How do I get that iron? How do I get that buyer? How did that happen? Which of you has a cast iron pan? Put your hand up. If you only use it once a month, I say, \"What difference does it make?\" But if you use them daily, iron will end up in your food and that is more iron than your body needs. Or copper pipes. Who has copper pipes? The water is in those copper pipes all night and goes into the coffee machine in the morning, and then you drink that copper, more than you need, and that then produces free radicals that go to the brain. If you eat meat - and especially liver - you also get iron and copper as a result. We used to think, \"Isn\\'t that fantastic?\" until we realized that iron is a double-edged sword. You need some, but if you get too much, it becomes toxic. Vitamins. Vitamin producers add vitamin A and vitamins B, and vitamin C, and vitamin D. Then they add iron and copper, because 'You need them anyway', without acknowledging that we have had enough of it through our diet, and through those supplements you get too much. Okay, so what do I want to say now? I want to say that not only saturated and trans fats increase our risk, but also those metals, and that they form sparks in the brain, free radicals that scorch the connections. If that's the case, I need a fire extinguisher. And we have that, namely vitamin E. Vitamin E is in spinach and in mangos and especially in nuts and seeds. And in Chicago some ate a bit of it, and some ate a lot of it, and the beauty is that vitamin E is an antioxidant: it destroys free radicals. So if what I claim is true, then the people in Chicago would eat just a little bit of vitamin E run a much higher risk than those who ate a lot, and that is exactly what the research showed. Who ate eight milligrams of vitamin E a day, the risk of Alzheimer's nearly halved compared to those who ate less. Hmm, okay, how do I get enough in then? That is very simple: go to the store and just buy some pills with vitamin E. No, not because of that. In nature there are eight forms of vitamin E. It is in nuts and seeds, but if I put it in my supplements, Is it legal to have vitamin E if only one form is present? And if you eat too much of one specific form limits the absorption of all other forms. So you want to take it through food; that's how nature designed it for us and that is the form in which we evolved. We can go one step further. By the way, I forgot to mention something. How much do we need? If I take some nuts or seeds in my palm and it comes to your fingers, that's about 30 grams, and that's about five milligrams of vitamin E. The thing is: don't eat that, because you know what happens then. If you take such salted almonds and you eat your hand empty, then you fill it up again and eat it again. Salted nuts are irresistible, or is that me? They are addictive in a certain way. So don't do it that way, you consume more than necessary. You better take them in your hand and then crumble and put on your salad, in your oatmeal porridge, or on your pancakes. Use them as a seasoning and not as a snack, then you're in the right place. Good, researchers at the University of Cincinnati went one step further. Not just saturated fats, trans fats, or vitamin E, but they said: \"What about color?\" Take a look at blueberries and grapes: that color is particularly intense. And the color of blueberries is not just for beauty; we call it anthocyanins. They investigated a certain group with an average age of 78, of which everyone had memory problems. They asked them to drink half a liter of grape juice every day. A glass in the morning and an evening. Three months later they tested everyone, and their memory was better. Three months? That sounds too simple. How is that possible? Think for a moment: a grape has a hard life. It must hang on the vine all day under the sun, exposed to the elements, without protection. Or is it? That purple color, those anthocyanins, forms a powerful antioxidant, just like vitamin E, but then in grape form. And when you eat it, it ends up in your bloodstream. They don't necessarily have to be grapes, but anything with that color. Such as blueberries. Back to the laboratory: a new group of patients came, all with memory problems. Blue berry juice after three months their memory was better. The moral of the story is not to eat grapes and blueberries and drink their juice. No, color is the answer. If we look at colorful food, we learn an important lesson. You walk into the supermarket, and from meters away you recognize in the shelves beta-carotene, lycopene, anthocyanins. Your retina can detect them because it is the orange color of carrots, or the red color of tomatoes, or the purple color of grapes. And your brain then tells you that this is beautiful and attractive, you recognize the antioxidants and are attracted to them. So in 2009 my organization went, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, to the department of agriculture. We said, \"This is important. Get rid of the food pyramid.\" It had a nice shape, but it had a box for meat, and a box for dairy, despite the fact that people who do not eat meat or dairy be healthier than people who do. By the way, who eats from a pyramid now? We eat from a plate. So we came up with a plate indicating fruit, grains, legumes and vegetables, because they must be our main components. We passed this on to the USDA in 2009 but we heard nothing from them. So in 2011 we sued the federal government. The Physicians Committee against the USDA, simply to provoke a response. And did you see what the American government came up with that year? I don't want to walk with honor but this is now the government policy called MyPlate, and it looks somewhat similar on what we sent them a few years earlier. Fruit, and grains, and vegetables, and there is a so-called 'protein group'. That group may consist of meat, but also beans, or tofu, or nuts, or anything rich in protein, it doesn't have to be meat. There is actually no meat group in the federal guidelines. There is still a dairy group, but soy milk is included. So it's heading in the right direction. What we talked about so far is the avoidance of saturated fats, such as in cheese, bacon, and meat; avoiding trans fats and snacks; eating vitamin E and colorful food, and there is one final step. It is not only about nutrition, but also about exercise. At the University of Illinois researchers brought in 120 adults and allowed them to walk briskly three times a week. A year later, everyone took a brain scan. They looked at the hippocampus, the memory station in the center of the brain: that determines what is stored in the memory and what is not allowed. It now appeared that this body, that with age gets shrinking, suddenly stopped shrinking. They saw with the moving group that the hippocampus got a little bigger, and a little bigger, and a little bigger, as if time went backwards: It reversed the shrinking of the brain and they clearly outperformed on memory tests. So I designed my own sports plan. I would like to introduce it to you, I do this three times a week. Arrive at the airport as late as possible, carrying extremely heavy luggage, and then running for that plane. (Laughter) They had a different idea at the University of Illinois, and that was a bit simpler. Take a ten-minute walk and do it three times a week. The following week you do a 15-minute walk, and the next week 20. They just added five minutes a week to 40 minutes. Such a brisk walk of 40 minutes - this is not about dribbling, but really decent steps - 40 minutes, three times a week, is all you need for your memory and the size of your brain. Very easy. I would like to go back in time, and talk to my father and say to him: \"Dad, I have discovered something very important. We change our diet, we don't really need that cheese and that bacon. There are more than enough healthy things to eat. We go for colorful vegetables and fruit, and make it a daily habit. We put on our sneakers and move together. \" It's too late for him. But it's not too late for you. Neither for me, and if we use what we have learned now about how we can protect our brain, then families might be able to stay together a little longer. Thank you very much.", "0ZL_q7oUVrQ": "they give it to win and win throws it to Kelsey Kelsey is going to score  razzle-dazzle from Butch Jones what a trick play by the Bearcats 37 yards Cincinnati

he hands it to old in the but he didn't hold it he left it right on the ground the only way you can give it to a lineman as you got a fumble it he cannot take it and hand it to him so what he did is he got it from the center and left it on the grounds if guard he's talked about flexibility watching now the ball goes right on the ground  right on the ground Stein Cunha picks it up you just left it

this evening to ask you to join together with me to welcome Les Brown for his third in a series of four classes les is one of the most inspiring motivational teachers in America today when I heard him three years ago it actually brought tears to my eyes and I rushed one of my son's over afterwards to introduce him to Les and my feeling was every young person in America needs to hear this man because if you could start them out young learning the kinds of ideas that he can put across so beautifully and so enthusiastically and so from the heart it would change America  and I knew when he was here before we'd be having him back again you know how you just know something and so I'm just thrilled tonight to introduce to you Les Brown  good evening how you doing  I'll ask how you're doing I want you to say better than good and better than most how you doing I know that's right and sometimes even better than that right I like to just let you know I really appreciate the opportunity to share some time with you again once you give Leonor round of applause please very good I'm very very supportive of this ministry I think that Jack Poland's is ahead of his time and the people here who show a level of concern in terms of empowering people and helping them to develop the skills that are necessary to navigate through some of the treacherous waters of life it's something that's very much needed this evening we're going to be looking at how to get unstuck I think some of you know what I mean sometimes we have to ask ourselves what's using my life heard a guy give a lecture one time that says we are today what we were win and he's talking about the fact that we to a great extent behave think react because of some previous experience that we've had one of the things that we know about life is that it is always changing sometimes you up sometimes you're down sometimes things go real well and sometimes they don't sometimes you're happy and sometimes you said now that's that thing called life and when we begin to understand and know that accepting that reality that that we will never ever have things just on an even keel all the time but you're going to have some ups then you're going to have some downs but during those down moments that's where the growth takes place that's where the work is anybody can feel good when they have their health their bills the paid they have happy relationships the children are acting normal business is successful anybody could be positive then anybody can have a larger vision then anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances am I correct see but the real challenge the real challenge of growth mentally emotionally and spiritually comes when you get knocked down somebody said that that adversity introduces a man to himself or woman how you handle it that's where the growth takes place when I was facing some challenges I had a guy say something to me and I suggest this is one of the first things that you want to do when you're facing a challenge you want to get unstuck evaluate where you are look at it assess yourself assess yourself and assess the situation what brought you there what role did you play Earl Nightingale had a saying I like he said all of us are self-made but only the successful will admit it  what has brought you to this point what did you learn from it are you learning anything are you doing it over and over and over again somebody said that insanity is doing the same thing in the same way expecting a different outcome  are you going through it are you growing through it are you bigger and better because of it because it's not going to leave you until you grow through it I was going through a major challenge in my life that was wearing me out that was using me and one of my students told me in a class that I was teaching lessons in truth she said less until you handle it with grace it will stay in your face  mmm and it stayed there long time  the challenges of life how do we get it how do we get stuck a friend of mine went through a divorce my best friend he had a wife that did not love him as much as he loved her it was this first real true love he was a very religious man did not believe in divorce he made a mistake and he paid for his mistake with a lot of pain a lot of Tears and they came to a point where he knew he should have got a divorce but he was stuck he was stuck in something called revenge he said she's made me so miserable I'm going to pay her back he was stuck and he stayed in there longer than he should have because it began to attack him it began to affect him psychologically and as a result of that would eventually did get a divorce he took that same attitude to other relationships looking for something to go wrong he was burned so badly he did not want to risk pain again he was going in relationships trying to avoid pain when it became too close he would do something to make sure the relationship did not work he would always try and find something wrong with the person because there no perfect people so if you look for it you can find it he was stuck in revenge another friend of mine working on a job loved the company very much expected to retire there and one day they call him in the office ask him for his badge and identification told the security man up walked into his desk told him he was fired and he had to leave then he was devastated and if you came anywhere near him he will tell you his story as we all have stories even when he got a job he went on the job telling anybody who would listen how they fired him unjustly and he always ended with it wasn't fair life isn't fair life just is it's not fair that birds eat worms and they do  so we can't even deal with what's fair but he's stuck in the fact that it's not fair I don't deserve that they were wrong I used to be a state legislator in Columbus Ohio during the break we used to go out on the front lawn of the Ohio legislature and the Capitol there and observe people as they came by there was one particular person that all of us knew the children adults everybody used to pick at him when he came by we called him chicken man he had a feather in his hat he had a toy chicken on top of his car that he would drive around the area in downtown blinking his lights and occasionally blowing his horn when he got out of his car he would dry he would walk down town with a baby carriage with two little baby dolls in there and a picture of a woman and when you say something to him I came near him you would hear him making the sounds of a chicken all of us used to laugh at chicken man we didn't know chicken man's story chicken man woke up one morning around 3:00 a.m. and his house was on fire he panicked and he got out of the window left quickly only to get outside to hear his children and his wife screaming for help he ran back to the door to go in to save them and the flames were too hot too awesome he tried to get in he couldn't get in he was desperate frantic pretty soon the cries stopped they perish in the fire his brother-in-law came found out that his sister had died and his nieces in the fire grabbed chicken man and start beating him you chicken why did you save my sister your chicken your chicken when the people pulled it off chicken man they picked him up and said are you all right and chicken man looked at him and he started making the sounds of a chicken he never ever overcame that tragedy he will stop from that experience none of us knew what chicken man went wrong with this picture and these little dolls I remember when I was stuck in anger for a long time when I made a commitment to my adopted mother that I was going to purchase her home I'll never forget the experience of working real hard to get the money for the down payment so one who told me of a beautiful home and exclusive area of Miami went to see it took my mother there and she said yes I wanted theirs on the water we went to the closing my attorney said less have you had a title search I said what's a title search well you just take a couple of days to check it out and make sure there are no liens against the property that you might have to pay if you buy this home the guy who was there selling me the house he said listen he said the only reason that I'm selling you this house and selling it at a loss is because I admire the fact that you want to purchase this house for your mother I have another guy who will give me substantially more money but I like you and I've got to get back to Philadelphia now if we cannot consummate this deal now then the deal is off I said there are no liens against the property he says no of course not I looked at my attorney I said I believe him I'll sign she said mr. Brown I'm not questioning his honesty she said but business is business I signed that contract and we had a big celebration everybody in the neighborhood was talking about Leslie coming home one of the twins that Mamie adopted to buy her home Charl isn't that nice God is going to bless him  a few weeks later I received a letter a registered letter indicating that the house was going up for shelf sale on the courthouse steps a man had filed a $12,000 lien against the property because the previous owner old him that money and if I did not come up with $12,000 in 30 days he was going to sell the house to the highest bidder I called this man and said mister my name is les Rana I purchased this house I had nothing to do with your prior bill bill bill he said that's not my problem he said you should have had a title search I said can you give me time I said my mother is an older lady she has a bad heart and I said please I said if you just give me the time I don't know how I'm going to do it with the house note and everything else but I think I can pay you at least $2,000 a month and within six months somehow I will pay your money he said no I wanted all in 30 days or you get out I did everything I could rack my mind thinking about how I could get $12,000 because I took everything I could to get the money just for the down payment and the closing I finally had to face the reality that I wasn't going to be able to do it I was up around two o'clock in the morning walking back and forth thinking how was I going to tell my mother this my children were there in the room sleeping all night long I agonized over this I lost over 23 pounds pretty soon I went in the room where my mother was sleeping and I said mama I got down on my knees by the bed I said mama I got to talk to you and she said what's wrong I said mama I said we got to get out the house I said in my haste to buy the house I made a mistake she said that's all right baby I didn't like this house city huh  I said mama you told me you loved it I brought our friends I didn't said she said you don't have arthritis in my knees and I don't like going up the steps but I knew it made you happy you loved it so much I said mom I've lost 23 pounds agonizing over this well we had to pack up and go back to the old house down the street from Northwestern High School in Liberty City all those neighbors who came out and saw his lead those neighbors were there as we were coming back we went in the house the roaches were playing cards saying come on in and take a hand I was wiped out I was embarrassed and humiliated words cannot encompass the symbolism of what I felt I remember when I was unloading the furniture now I began to cry my sister came by hmm you know you didn't have any money to buy no house mr. big time hadn't given me a quarter you know mama got a bad heart not y'all back where you belong as I was crying my head down taking furniture and my momma said hold your head up I said mama I said I just feel so bad about this mama she said hold your head up and dry your tears you have nothing to be shame up and I did as we unloaded that furniture in that house for several weeks I was numb I was immobilized with anger if I had seen that guy I was thinking about flying to Philadelphia I had all kind of dreams about him and I didn't want to get this guy here hitting would been too good for him I just want to just grab him and just bite him just I just may have found him they say well we found this guy just chewing on it beating would have been too good for him Ida just get him every time in my own I'd have been like our Doberman Pinscher if the god were to say I thought I made everything but I don't know where this came from I was reading the book on forgiveness  and they had a lot of that says forgive and grow I had to let that luggage go you see your mind is is you know when you're going to a service station to get gas you don't go in there and just start pumping when you push the lever up it clears the previous bill by the same token if you want to begin to move you've got to clear your mind of all the unnecessary luggage and baggage that's weighing us down I couldn't move I couldn't think about what am I going to do to get out of this situation because I was so concerned about what happened and what he did to me and how bad it was I was sold stuck in that I couldn't even focus on what I should have done feeling sorry for myself and angry and none of that was taking me anywhere so pretty soon I I learned through effort made a conscious deliberate determined effort I had to let it go I had to forgive it let it go and begin to focus on developing myself and I say to you you're going to have people to do things to you things are going to happen to you and the most important thing to do is to harness your will and let it go and move so you can grow so you can get on with your life it doesn't matter about what happens to you what matters is what are you going to do about it what are you going to do now less huh how long do you want to tell everybody at the bus stop in anybody who would stand and listen to you how long you repeat the same thing over and over and over and over and over again how many times do we have to hear that don't go around telling people what your story is everybody has a story 80% don't care and 20% glad it's you  it's out glad that didn't happen to be sometimes you think you got some problems you hear somebody else problem and the way that their problem is real bad it make you feel good alright tried to let that go all of us got stories to tell chicken man allowed his tragedy to destroy his life all of us have experienced some tragedy and if we haven't we will and you can either let it destroy your life or you can build upon it you can permit it to let you let it hold you down or you can decide I'm not going to let that happen to me I'm bigger than this make a declaration to yourself declare all-out war that you're going to get out of this rut I don't care how good you are until I care how talented you are I don't care how much you work on yourself there's some times when things aren't going to go right they just I'm not going to go right there are times with anything that can happen will happen Murphy's Law will be knocking at your door why I don't know why that's called life and you have to deal with it sometimes your life will be in a slump just like sports some of the best shooters can't hit baskets different times and games they get in a slump do they sit on the sidelines and say you know jested hit a basket today no they continue to execute I suggest to you that if you are facing a challenge don't stop stay busy work your plan continue to do those things that you know that work for you after you have evaluated yourself in the situation continue to move stay busy stay busy stay busy repeat after me help somebody and help yourself because what you give is what you get find somebody that you can help so you can forget about you for a moment see sometimes the best thing to do is to be sometimes you have to just back up and go within yourself a bow and arrow you you can't take a bow and just push it out an hour you just can't push the Aral out you have to pull it back and then release it sometimes you have to back up and go within and pray and meditate and recharge your batteries go away clear your head and then come back and look at it from a different vantage point don't operate while you are under the spell of the effect of what's going on next thing is that you've got to activate the thinker in you don't allow your emotions to control you we are emotional but you want to begin to discipline your emotion if you don't discipline and contain your emotions they will use you your mind goes on automatic just like a god you know I loved reading the book call as a man thinketh by James Allen he uses the analogy of the mind being like a garden you know weeds don't have to have any encouragement to grow you don't have to water them they don't have to get sunshine they don't have to have fertile ground they will grow through the cracks of a sidewalk am i right but if you want to grow orchids or roses or any kind of exotic flowers there are special processes and procedures you must go through well by the same token you don't have to force yourself or motivate yourself to think negatively to be depressed to hate somebody to want revenge you want to get back at somebody to beat yourself up over the head to feel loaded with guilt you don't have to make any effort to do that your mind is on automatic it will do that by itself but if you want to begin to move into your own personal greatness if you want to begin to really enjoy a happy successful healthy life you've got to be willing to go against the tide you've got to be willing to harness your will and say in spite of this I'm in control here I'm not going to let this get me down I'm not going to let this destroy me I'm coming back and I'll be stronger and better because of it you have got to make a declaration that this is what you stand for you're standing up for your dreams you're standing up for peace of mind you're standing up for health you want it and you're going to go all out to have it it's not going to be easy when you want to change it's not easy if it were in fact easy everybody to do it but if you're serious you'll go all out so yes I'm going to turn this situation around I'm not going to sit back and and moan and cry over what happened and what went wrong and who did what I'm going to do something about this situation the next thing that is important is that expect things to get better for you because they are say life is cyclic you're not what is it whatever experience you're having right now it has not come to stay it has come to pass not to stay just to pass it's just going through the biggest challenge is is to know what's happening this is a part of this thing we call life this too shall pass and maintaining perspective putting it in perspective I was doing a training at a college and it was a two-day training during orientation and in the training that I provide I'm a motivational speaker but I conduct processes and personal dynamics where people begin to go through changes that stimulate the right and left hemisphere of the brain enable them to see themselves differently I conducted this particular simulation with these young kids 17 and 18 years of age so that they would begin to see how they make decisions and how they would survive in this particular simulation process we gave them we had them to do it individually and then collectively over 30% of them wrote down as their first option in order to survive they would commit suicide first thing they wrote down suicide among young people has increased 300% over 5,000 will successfully take their lives this year why why did it do that they defensive I was so shocked I said what do you mean well at least we would not suffer and then they had the nerve to write down all of the other things they were going to do after they committed suicide I said listen to Dumbo now when you when you come up with a permanent solution for a temporary problem that's it games over that's it you're not going to do anything anybody wrote suicide at the top you can put your pencil down see a lot of us because of our limited vision of ourselves a lot of us who begin to focus on problems and enable them to overwhelm us we begin to think that we have no options we begin to believe that there's no way out repeat after me there's always a way where there's a will there's a way shake somebody's hand on your right or left and say I'm unstoppable  you've got to make those kind of declarations to yourself I'm unstoppable this will not get me down and if I get knocked down I'm gonna be like Leo Pascal you said you're gonna have some low moments in life but when you do you will have high lows when you work on yourself what are some of those things that you can do during this period of time go for walks do some things for you just go for a stroll so you can engage in some reflective thinking on life on yourself looking and enjoying the universe smelling the roses along the way listen to upbeat music music that inspires you I have only but goodies I have strategies that I engage in to recharge my batteries I'm preparing for that because I know things are going to happen that I cannot anticipate very good friend of mine died the other day I had a program for myself I have books that I read that inspire me tapes that I listen to that fire me up because you're going to have sometimes low moments when you won't want to get out of bed you just want to stay there at times you won't want to come out of the house that times you'll be feeling bad and don't know why what's wrong I don't know just leave me alone  what did I happen I don't know it's called life  the other thing is take full responsibility for your life except where you are and the responsibility that you're going to take yourself where you want to go so once that we have two primary choices in life we can either accept conditions as they exist or we can take the responsibility to change them see a lot of people want to exempt themselves from taking responsibility all they want to do is talk about the problem every time you see them they'll tell you their story over and over and over and over again no no you want to take responsibility for your life I got me here I can get me out of this and I'm getting out I'm not going to be a volunteer victim George Bernard Shaw said there two kinds of people in life you know he said those that make things happen those that watch things happen and those that don't know what happened and he said the people that get alone in this life look around for the circumstances that they want and if they can't find them they make up they creator so part of beginning to get unstuck you've got to decide that the behavior pattern that you have adopted doesn't work for you you've got to change your strategies and changing your strategy means reinventing your life  recreating you and you have the power to do that you can decide that you're going to change that you're not going to be a wimp  you can decide that you're going to stand up to life you can decide that I'm going to live each day as if it were my less you can you have the power to make that decision you can decide I'm going to work on myself and develop myself I'm going to empower me and all of these things that are happening to me right now they're just temporary inconveniences they're not stronger than I am I'm in charge here next thing is separate what you do from who you are that's what the guilt trap is about see a lot of folks won't let you forget what you used to do or what you have done what mistakes you've made all of us have made some mistakes in life all of us have done some things that if we had them to do over again we wouldn't do it again a lot of things that if I had it to do over again if I knew then what I know now I would have done it differently well it did happen that way and that's what you call life I didn't do it like that oh you don't want me to live that down how you want to keep on putting that in my face about what I did guess what I'm not interested that's what I did then won't do it today so you are picking on an innocent man hello  so as you in the process of reinventing your life write a description of the kind of person that you want to be what are the things that you must overcome what qualities about your personality you know that you're going to have to change because those particular characteristics are liabilities to you what are you assets what are your strong points look at and evaluating yourself to make that determination other thing is that in order to get out of a rut we need some coaching find some trusted critics people that you know care about you love you some things that keeps us from growing and getting out of ruts number one we identify with feedback we take it personal when someone want to give us some feedback on where we are falling short tell us about our blind spots we want to have everything being positive about us we're not perfect it's it hurts I have a friend who's a trusted critic I don't like him but I love him he doesn't tell me the things I want to hear he tell me what I need to hear so I can grow it hurts it hurts when he put me on the hot seat I can't stand it but that's the only way that I can grow and I'm glad that he loves me enough to risk our friendship to tell me what I need to hear not what I want to hear  get a support group somebody that you can talk to people who perhaps might have a similar problem support groups are very powerful that you can share some of the challenges that you're going through and it might be a situation where one person can give you an idea of how they handle that situation and create an opening for you begin to stimulate some possibilities in your mind on how you can resolve the problem we can't grow by ourselves as I mentioned before we grow from people and projects the other thing is about life when things happen to you when you permit things to use you you can't change the past which you can interpret you can reinterpret how you see it for years I was going around with a heavy load on my shoulders feeling bad because I was adopted doing interviews for adoption agencies in foster homes and I was on television once and I I told these people in this particular interview that I was given away my twin brother and I when we were six weeks of age friend of mine fortunately was listening to the program and she said les like to have lunch with you and so I went over to see her she said when a woman carries a baby for nine months feeling that life movement in her it's automatic and natural for her to learn to love that baby to expect it to come here when she bares to pain to bring it into the world your mother Mamie Brown when she came in to adopt you guys she didn't go through that process she looked at whoever your biological mother was and said I'll take her you weren't giving away less you were chosen with love hahaha  same circumstances same event but reinterpreted an interpretation that empowers me am I making sense to you so when you begin to look at your past give an interpretation that empowers you that's where I used to be that's not where I am now I'm growing now I want you to think about in your mind right now think about some particular event or act in your life that you feel very bad about that you really regret that that took place if you had to do over again you would do it differently with that there I want you to see yourself in your mind's eye and say to yourself I love myself unconditionally and I forgive myself I knew better I would have done better  I want you to think about somebody that that cost you some pain cost you some disappointment somebody that you don't like let me tell you something about the mind how it uses you tell you something super stupid that I'd used to do do you know for years I hated my mother and my father whoever they were because they gave me away as I thought at that point in time and guess what I didn't have any faces for the hatred because I never saw either one of them and I said I hate them for that and then once I forgave them and said it's okay had they not given me away I would have never been blessed to have the mother that I have who to me is the greatest mother in the world so the universe and Foles as it's you  but when I went through this process saying forgive them I remember in my mind as I was trying to picture these people I had two individuals in my mind standing there with no faces because I didn't know how they look but I released that I let that luggage go think about somebody that you've heard somebody that you've disappointed either deliberately or inadvertently or someone that has hurt you deliberately or inadvertently think about them somebody that that you really really when you think about them that the room turns red look at them in your mind's eye and say I forgive you I  forgive you unconditionally for that's a heavy load to let off when I thought about that guy I said wait a minute I can't no no you don't know what this guy did this was my mama you don't know what we went through my students said les forgive let it go if you want to be forgiven you better forgive somebody none of us are perfect all of us have made some mistakes and it wasn't easy it's not easy forgiving am i right it's not everybody won't forget they say I forgive but I don't forget now  let it go so you can grow let's get a little demonstration here throw it up with you on this side here right demonstrate it like this let's go I throw away negative thoughts revenge guilt anything that's been holding me back now with that right hand let's bring something in I bring in love peace of mind good relationships whole lot of money  I don't know why people raise their voices when we say holdout of that I mean they get serious - you know they they use with people are you running to use two hands it and trackball somebody else's hair you know reinterpreting our past understanding and knowing that we can move from where we are that we can begin to design the kind of life that empowers us that gives us happiness that enables us to be on top of who we are knowing that as we begin to explore new horizons and new vistas in life that as we begin to to focus on developing ourselves as we begin to elevate ourselves and not to follow the crowd activating the thinker in us and dis disciplining and putting on hold the emotional part of ourselves it's not easy but through practice and practice and practice practice makes what absolutely not dismantle that belief system practice makes improvement you can always better your best you can always go beyond anything that you have ever done you never hit a state of perfection you're always bigger than what you do and so all you're looking for new breakthroughs through practice and practice and practice you'll get better and better and better and there's still some things that will happen to you that will catch you on the blindside that you did not anticipate you'll get knocked down but you won't be knocked out you'll be able to get to your feet again beyond the ropes but you have a fast recovery rate when you work on yourself read inspirational books of course listen to tapes that begin to inspire you and stay around people who will empower you  people that will help you feel good about who you are as you're in the process of transforming your life life is so beautiful today someone gave me something on life call what is life I like to share it with you  in summary getting unstuck means that you are going to start living life on your terms rather than just gliding through everyday on automatic but you are aware that you're stimulated and you excited about your unfolding future that you have a special power within that you know that things are going to get better for you you know that you can handle this and sometimes you have to cry sometimes life will take you to your knees  but the pain opens spaces in the heart for joy somebody said about life I love this says life is like an onion you you have to peel it one layer at a time and sometimes you cry  this office said about life life is a challenge meeting life is a gift accepting life is an adventure Tarun life is a sorrow overcoming life is a tragedy face it life is a duty perform it life is a game plan life is a mystery unfolding life is a song sing it life is an opportunity take it life is a journey completed life is a promise fulfilling life is a beauty praising life is a struggle fighting life is a goal achieving life is a puzzle solve it I love that  remember something I heard in high school it's called I I met a man today at first I said he's Irish where he has an Irish way a sympathy and friendliness and warms you threw him through and then I thought oh no he's not he really is a Jew his eyes so dark and elephant-like Isuprel like those of Peter maybe or perhaps Emanuel he's still there with a quiet grace Olson Lim he wasn't all I knew he was an Englishman and not a Jew at all and yet the skin was very fair a Viking he could be such as those who cast their ships against the sea his hat was dark with a mist of India Japan his courtesy was China's on his dignity around I met a man today and and he was marvelously fair he really was a child of God and he came from everywhere this is mrs. Mamie Browns baby boy saying it's been a plum pleasing pleasure as well as a privilege thank y'all here  you", "k4jLxVILsFE": "[Music]  it is time to break out the big boy wait hello everybody and welcome to our continuing live coverage of the 2013 Reebok CrossFit Games live for the sub up Center in Carson California I'm Sean woodland alongside Bill grande ler and we are ready for the eighth of twelve sport events the clean-and-jerk ladder and bill after seven events look how tight things are at the top of the leaderboard it is so cool to see that the the race this close this is exactly what everyone is hoping for it's great spirits moving up it's great to see Jace on the top it's great to see some new names in there like Eric Fisher he is doing amazing so far during this weekend this is our first pure strength event of the competition it's a clean and jerk ladder every 90 seconds you move to a weight that was 10 pounds heavier than the one you just did the key here the men had to choose their starting weights on Thursday and they had four weights from which to choose 225 pounds 255 pounds to 85 or 315 now what's up you have to hit your first weight here at the clean-and-jerk your first weight in order to move on not only in this event in the competition so if you fail on the way you choose you are out and the crazy thing about making that decision early is you didn't get to fill any of the volume that you had leading up to this event it's night everyone has their their max clean-and-jerk up to this but it's usually a day that they got the rest and everything before that's a setup for it they have now gone through these couple days of just an onslaught of work now they have to do that that heavy weight so that decision could be very very important to the rest of their career for this this competition and to that point there are plenty of athletes in the field who have their max clean-and-jerk listed well above 300 pounds who are starting at 285 we saw this in the regional competition with that triple overhead squat max effort some people on their first did not make it did not survive in the competition so right now it's Orlando trail at the 285-pound bar Ryan Swoboda at 2:55 in Gary and humming at 225 in trail and 285 pounds on the Latin America that is no problem for him not even a problem no and that's a good thing I think start even though he has his he's listed in his max at 335 I think it's a good way for him to start at let him build into a little bit don't risk it again he wants to stay in the competition he got knocked out last year with the swim so he wants to continue through here another look at Orlando's lifts at 285 pounds the only thing I would have said on that is the arms were a little bent in our world what we say is you bend your arm to losing power maybe that's it's kind of help position that bar little bit better on his hips but you know a nice easy lift for him event advanced and 10 pound increments there are four rows of barbells out there you can only advance to the end of your row so if you're Gary helping can you started at 245 pounds the heaviest you can go is 315 and that's actually the starting weight on the fourth and final ladder you know this is a lot different than what you'll see in a lot of the regular type gyms when you're going for your one rep max is you know what just take 90 second you should kind of go around talk to everyone to get a drink of water these guys have this 90 seconds between the start and into the next lift so they're told when to move they're told when they have to go they have to increase their weight and that's increasingly difficult you know you get in there four or five reps that's a lot of weight you're moving around Orlando trail moves up to 295 Ryan slow buddy moving up to 265 again Orlando's got that heavy pulled his arms no problem with 295 Orlando trailing out slow Padilla 265 and that's a good left for Ryan suavity Gary talvik was also able to clear 235 pounds  [Music]  Orlando Trejo he's again he has a great clean again that slight bend in the arms is a little strange you don't even see most of the athletes doing that but what's really helping him is that jerk that jerk is solid nice dip and drive with his hips and when that bar gets up overhead he catches it locked arms no bobble in his arms at all that's gonna that's gonna bode well for him and then they have your weights Orlando Trejo currently lifting the heaviest weight out there on the ladder behind him in the white mike mackool Drake getting set to step up to the 285-pound warez Trejo moves up to 305  you have 80 seconds to make the lifter than a ten-second transition period so again they need to be able to conserve themselves enough to get into that neck you know moving into that next platform  so trail up to 305 the gold ring to 285 Brian's sweaty on your right he's at 275 pounds Trey on the Left he's at 305 [Music] little bottle out of the hole there you know as long as he has a good really good front squat that's not too much of an issue [Music] 305 now slowly struggling at 275 and could not stabilize it but he does have a chance now to make another attempt you do get a partial score for successfully cleaning the weight so if somebody does not complete the clean-and-jerk here he will leave the field with a score of 275 I think that's a really good thing for these athletes bill to have that little extra set in there that little extra point to get you know get credit for that that's important well buddy one more attend to 275 many candidates can't walk out those arms again when you get that weight up overhead you don't want that way to bobble at all you want to catch it when it's weightless so a nice dip and drive and lock in those arms keeping that stabilized not just with the locked elbow but if the shoulders were you got to keep that upper torso tight again you know what for him I think he's actually now that I see what he's doing he's hitting that bar right up at the pocket that's why I has a slight Bend it's working well and his jerk is perfect that was really trail moving up to the 315 pound bar behind his bike McGoldrick McGoldrick at the 295 how far and then behind mike McGoldrick austin malleolus ebbing onto the floor he's in the picture behind Michael Goldberg and a waste [Music]  on the left at 265 pounds  all those hats 4265 while train was going to make another run at 3:15 now Elena Trejo you know he has a good front squat so I think he feels confident trying to bounce out of the bottom like that but if you get loose at the bottom and you allow that that that spine to curve and around all sudden you your your joints all kind of roll in on themselves you lose that stability you don't have the ability to bounce out of there Trejo one more go at 315 pounds [Applause] and he cannot get underneath it orlando trail looking like he's going to leave the ladder with a score of 3 or 5.2 is 305 pounds the last successful lip that he had there's trails fits the first time you touched his arm you can see you can see you got that round in the back end his hips came underneath them underneath underneath his hips just wasn't enough and it's stable enough to come out second attempt nice Oh can't get its Orlando trail we'll leave the ladder after a successful list at 305 so he is currently your leader there's some big ol dirt they'll go to 95 there's so many body position points that have to happen to have a real strong lift and you can feel that you you you missed one of those body points or elbows drop get a little loose in the bottom loosing the shoulders the lips will feel literally 20 pounds different so it's all about a state tighten same perfect in your form all the way through  [Music] forest 275 Alex daddy at 265 in the yellow shirt behind forest a successful lift for him Marcus Billy also out there is his Eric McGee huge crowd on hand here at the soccer stadium for the stuff up center the first time since we booted this facility that we have used the soccer stadium for events and this place is still filling up there in the upper deck there at the lower bowl we expect 24,000 Plus on hand for the 2013 Reebok CrossFit Games and this evening it's going to be pandemonium when we move inside of the tennis stadium Alex Neddy just completed a lift at 265 pounds so Alex and he's taking a rest right here but you'll see it different at least on that last lift he did what's called a power clean not going down into a full squat now if he has the strength to do that that's great because it actually saves his legs a little bit but once you get into the heavier way it's the problem with that lift is that you have to get that weight up a lot higher so the squat clean don't have to bring up the weight as high you squat down underneath it but no why waste your legs if you don't need to let's see if he does end here on this on this way moving at the 275 in front of him Zack Morris is on the 285 pound bar on the right is fight but gold Rick he's at 315 pounds behind him is asif ali a low is 3 behind ball Eric McGee at 295 pounds like my Goldbergs gonna stand up 315 pounds Zack for us it's 285 but Goldberg gets 315 and Eddie gets 275 again Alex and Eddie all Anna dude the power claim he popped that up so easily again saving his legs for some of the heavier weight mike mackool Durin's that was an impressive lift he looks solid on the front squat jerk did no problem he's got a couple more in the in the tank for sure Jerry Helmick just hit 275 pounds McGoldrick that was just a PR for him his last listed PR on this lift 310 pounds for the former hockey player from Middle Tennessee State University  [Music] you know that's exactly what you want to do is hit your PRS when you come in here to the games it's impressive and it blows my mind every single year when you have guys that do that after they've gone through everything that they just went through the last couple days let's remind everybody these guys are not lifting fresh they've been through seven events one this morning now Asia Bartow one of the biggest athletes in this competition at 225 pounds Bartow is on the field starting in the 285 pound bar now again ADA has a listed record of 340 pounds but I'm thinking he's gonna go ahead and again build him build a little bit of momentum as he gets up on the platform 350 the Goldberg cake in 325 on the left is Zack Morris at 295 pounds line him Alex nany in the yellow at 285 off Mallos just unable to get that jerk didn't get underneath the bar press it out in front of him wasn't able to get underneath it  that's on a blackboard but he gets back on I'm gonna count the lay down they're not going to castle ever exact words he did get a successful plate in the chance to do it again not even needed use a real deep split on that it was a narrow narrow split usually we'll see you guys split really wide so they can get deep quickly didn't even need to do that it jumped it up so high volley ah low and 315 still trying to complete that live down Zack Morris another go at 295 pounds he was able to get it overhead but he came off at the platform you can undo that so now but he will get partial credit for his last lift to 95.1 4/4 with this man Mike Goldberg 25 so solid look at that drive out of the hole he doesn't look at all like it to PR not even me he could have gone a lot deeper a couple more lifts in them with that all he has to go down is a little bit deeper a little bit more speed on that drop and he's going to get a couple more lifts out of it Matt chin is on the floor 285 pounds in the band who finished second at the games last year textbook matches the gold or get 335 standing up behind him Derrick McKey at 315 pounds and now it's an Alec steady jump at 295 [Music] see that right there's a problem with the power clean versus the squat clean he has to get down underneath it Daleks Nettie he's not the best at his front squats you know that that's a little bit of a weakness so he's doing everything he can to avoid that you actually saw his feet starts to split but you know that Alice City the cool thing about this guy when he was at the regionals hit all he had a different outfit for every single workout that he didn't I think he's the only guy out here right now Taylor converse right there meanwhile Mike Micawber can't get 335 so the gold rig PRA but can't set another one now it's deadia 295 a given power think that thing up there so Alex netting will be done as well the gold 335 more times to a PR for Mike McGoldrick and he will lead the field as your leader right now Mike Colter with that bloody shin and a lot of people who train a crossfitter very familiar with they're familiar with that you know what all that means is that he's been keeping that bar nice and close to his Chin's which all of his trainers were wanting to do so it looks bad but it's you know he's doing the right thing 295 pounds where Marcus Billy and now Eric's wiki on the right at 3:25 by hitman three fifteen is Daniel Kaminsky rookie all the 325 [Music] and a good [Music] he could not get 315 lockdown markets Billy just successfully lifting 295 pounds now you came in with a list at 325 pound PR started at 255 so again I'm not sure if he was worried about the volume of the weekend coming in he moved that easily so let's see how much further he can get right here Dan it's Minsky he needs to start getting some heavy lifts their dad need to start making his way back up the leaderboard he's done a lot of work with a lot of it  and this is not what he needed 315 just not gonna happen for Daniel zaminsky so he will leave the ladder now age apart oh we just got 305 we'll move up to the 350 pound bar Matt chances behind Tim as in 2010 game champion Graham Holmberg and now Dan Bailey getting set to step up for the 285 pound bar I'm crazy with Dan Bailey last year in the clean ladder this is a straight clean ladder he pulled 345 pounds I seen him on videos I've talked to him a little bit earlier he said that going overhead is where he has issues so he may be able to clean a lot of weight it's where he goes overhead and starts having some issues Bailey power  and easily overhead for Dan Bailey  I'll tell you what when he moves with a lot of draw ability is pretty impressive besides the elbow start to drop that rounded his back gotta bump on toad weight went down all it takes is all it takes is inches for that to happen [Music] Vicki's gonna make another go at 335 pounds behind him cooling down but the towel on his head agent Marco who just cleared 315 pounds smart move I think just saving his legs you know saving his legs until the next lift Eric boogie who finished third at the North East Regional  [Music] well you see right there Eric actually started rounded from the beginning all of his trainers I'm sure we can same put your shoulders back tighten up that upper spine so you're nice and tight before you go into that first pull he started around it he went through that whole movement rounded Eric begin leaving the field after successfully lifting 325 pounds and now Asia Bartow is your lead man on the ladder stepping up to the 325 pound bar behind him his mansion behind Chan Graham Holmberg on the Left Marquez Philly 350 Bartow no problem in three two one not even a rest the great thing about that right there a lot of these guys they get the weight in that front rack position and they sit and try to recuperate themselves in psychic trying to take a nice big breath all which agent did but he didn't he didn't have that time under tension get the bar to your shoulders take a breath get it up overhead and get out from underneath it just wrap that that will allow you to recover for the next lift Marcus Billy gonna make another go at 315 agent partner here's a look at that lived in 325 perfect form out at first cool stay down sensors up nice and tall a lot of speed moving back down underneath the bar for that split gonna go down a little bit quicker so he's not catching it without any bending his arm at all but that was a strong solid lift Asia Bartow out of behemoth across certain Katy Texas 65 225 of course he would name the gym after himself the behemoth you got to be a big DeMuth if you're working out with Asia Bardot getting set to move up to the 335 pound bar West Pyatt is now step under the ladder he successfully clearly clean under 285 pounds Marcus filly exiting the field after missing his lift at 295 pounds  for Marcus Billy and that's what Vito harloff steps up  Asia born to a 335 SEMA Jets in his hands there to get that grip on that bar [Applause] the loser new leader [Music] - it 3:25 cheese gets out of the holes out can he jerked away that right there solid solid jerk he saw hot why he went with his feet but he dropped into a pulley straight loc-nar position it was able to be stable underneath the weight allowed and get that way that was beautiful beautiful 315 failed on the jury but he did get the clean so he won't make another run at this weight again these guys aren't getting a whole lot of time if you miss it all all we've really really been able to see is someone just get the clean after that they barely get into that so time goes quickly for these guys  the tank to go after that weight so he'll have a score of three 15.1 gonna make another attempt though he has a successful clear it's under that and now our pods gonna stand it out [Music] now three 15.1 for vehicle our Papa let's go back and take a look at Matt Chan  Sall and clean off the ground look at that driving his hips up underneath again adjusting his grip so we can get a nice Drive on the bar solid solid lockout with the dorms down pretty free textbook Africa Asia part selfie 345 pounds for Gallardo [Applause] so that right there it's five pounds over this dish cleaning dirt PR so and he just looks so solid with that the thing with ADA a lot of people think that because you're tall and long you're not to be able to remove a whole lot of weight and then it takes too hard you got to move it too long but he defies all those alternate rumors he is so efficient and uses that momentum to get underneath that weight going up and getting under Brian Miller 315 couldn't get it overhead but he does complete the clean so filler will get 351 and now it's bad at 335 and shakin on get out of the hole on that one but he will get a chance to make another attempt behind immigrant woman in 325 pounds  [Music] oh we're just can't quite get underneath it now Jan another attended 335 this is not gonna happen for Matt Chan so chin leaving the ladder after successfully cleanin jerk 325 pounds but Asia part o just so solid he hit that bar up high on his thighs and again I think what's working best for him is he doesn't wait gets it up stabilized go there's not no hesitation at all 355 pounds are easy Bartow on the right on the left at 3:15 is Tyson Takasaki [Music] the whole domain that clean look pretty easy yeah you know he's used to being under a lot of weight you know he does a lot of work with Olympic lifting with his plea to jerk with the snatch that front squat was easy but you could tell the second he went and he went a little bit loose a pop that breath trying to go too soon really needed another breath of air tried to take a big breath and he just didn't have it just kind of collapsed collapse in that midline bar to a time for another attempt here er he has a successful clean so right now he's score would be 350 5.1 and he would be  Asia Bardot can't stand that one up so he's a part Oh leaving the floor after successfully cleaning 355 pounds we just couldn't put it overhead so far so now in the lead so he's got that front squat that was impressive see I think you just needed you needed to sit there for just a second he needed to wait just a little bit longer and then he would have been a little more solid that would have helped up with a splint it just would have been better lit but that was a very very impressive showing so far Asia Bartow signing a scorecard and now it's Dan Bailey moving up to 335 pounds on the left I see Takasaki at 325 pounds I said Takasaki successful if for him and Bailey can't get underneath 335 West pion is behind and Balian 325i high his tenant leveraged at 305 that's Roy Gamboa [Music] and it's trying to get the crowd fired up right now I can't pull that real big clean last year he needs to get this weight up overhead Paisley can't get underneath it right behind Bailey West blanket underneath 325 behind Pyatt kenneth leverage now has 315 racks wes is right up at his PR right there at 325 he's pleading with sucessfully 325 and he his jerk 325 he's never actually had a full fleet and jerk at 325 so fact that he's there after all his boiling that's that's impressive for West Kenneth beverage gonna go again after 315 Bailey at 335 to Skagen at leverets had 350 drag who didn't go for the jerk [Music] blanketing overhead but he will get partial credit three 15.1 for Kenneth leverage West quiet has also have NASA's David Bailey so that round knocking off three men from that middle that third ladder and now Tyson Takasaki 335 pounds nice drive of his hips right there he never Lots midline is elbow stayed up nights and hard keeping that bar right up against his throat Takasaki nicely under but just a belies he'll Maddox at 3:05 basically pressed that overhead  now I think you need to practice that slowly drilled afterwards drilled after the case after the package Gasper power at 3:15  all of the power clean on that exercises them dip down a little bit to come out of bottom what's it look like even needed to do that takasaka can't hit 335 but Castro Bowers successful live at 315 pounds with Dyson Nagasaki will leave the port after successfully lifted 325 pounds [Music] more time though for Tyson Takasaki but doesn't look like he's gonna make another go at it plus he's just gonna rest  miss MacFarlane Sutekh us Tyson Takasaki is done inside the soccer stadium here at the suburbs center for the first time since we moved this facility and look at the crowd on hand Lucas partner one of two men who's going to story at 300 you know this is it's risky it's risky he's only listen to 333 flanger best so he needs to get this even stay the competition for the rest of the weekend  [Music] [Applause]  the crowd appreciating that effort for Lucas Barker because a big fat lip he is out  I'm 11 321 that's a good lift for Roy Gamboa who now has 2 platforms left before he clears his lab but this is really showing I think this is great for a lot of CrossFitters when they go to their boxes if you know around the world a lot of people try to just lit and they come to this sort of a half split they don't really do it he needs to everyone else's all these guys are splitting and meeting split it's it's a you're gonna do it or not you can see all these athletes are doing that and that's what's helping them get that lift Lukas Parker stepped on the ladder at 3:15 when a two men two started that wait big risk for him but he made it pay off Chad Mackay beat Wow at 285 pounds the big Australia gets that overhead [Music]  look at that perfect form on the whole back state night straight head through the [Music] and get your shoulders underneath that bar to support that way 325 now for Lucas Parker on the left bo Maddox also at 325 pounds by Lucas Parker is bad half talk another athlete opening at 3:15 rusul in forever [Music] [Applause]  Lucas Parker Neil Maddox take it under it but he does have to reclaim it he does not have to reclaim his make another attempt and the old Maddox cannot successfully get 325 pounds over it and what that was was a squat jerk he's trying to get underneath it that way instead of splitted in his legs you actually see it saw him there's like one real big lifted that we really see do that and Cedric billet senator Karen said he when he splits he actually goes down into a full squat clean so he's all the way down Neil couldn't do that I think if he was to split he's fast enough he's strong enough and that's a more efficient movement by splitting together need for that for that jerk Maddox is gonna make one more run at this 325 pounds for do Maddox [Music] [Applause] [Music]  that's that overhead he needs to have speed on that jerk here's a look at that spurred cetera we actually made two attempts at the jerk so the dip drive is about getting underneath it snapping that bar off his shoulders he's just not going down fast enough and deep enough to catch that bar with locked arms now Lucas Parker at 335 pounds on the left is CJ Anderson at 325 and Matt half-cock at 325 as well behind Parker  they're subscribing at 325 that was actually falling backwards as he went underneath he keeps so far with his head underneath that actually the bar was gonna go behind him he was able to pull it back that's and that's great being that heavy you don't have those with those sort of abilities been stove workers at 325 as well and there's CA Anderson another one at 325  Anderson has it on the shoulder successful Church parameters for the beacon stay you can see how fast that was compared to new max a little bit more but deliver it down and up that was a snapping off of his shoulders allowing him to get underneath the bar za Anderson now will move up to the 335 [Music]  [Music]  [Applause] right there that is an anger you needed he willed that weight up and scared it and said you will go up Mookie Parker's smoker angel watch Jesus he's so he means the lack of ever and he's so animated 3:45 Nitai Jakarta Joko Rufus Parker  [Music] [Applause] you will fear the beard I think I think honestly I think honestly between Luke's partner Matt hath GART we have it and screaming match up on that last row both of them are yelling back and forth to the bar now CA Anderson at 3:35 there's a big weight around here in event number ASA clean-and-jerk ladder the age of 12 sport events here at the 2013 Reebok CrossFit Games she [Music] just can't get underneath that one to get himself out of the hole Daniel Pete Rose right behind ya Anderson at 325 now present packages in 3:45 that's not going to  just not strong in the hole not able to stay that keep that midline nice and tight elbows are dropping this touch but if you want to look at a classic textbook way to live Lucas Parker impeccable form bad half still alive behind him Jan the K on the left at 9:25 Lucas Parker for the overall lead now at 355 pounds [Music] [Applause] Wow that front squat out of the hole is easier than the last when he came out so Stalin underneath it but he does get to clean so he is your new leader at 350 5.1 and al achat mckay and 325 the big box trilling yeah so big so strong [Applause] rugby player Australia [Music] and Chaz McCain 325 for Jeb McCain Lukas Parker sighs a little time and he wants a bigger run at 3:55 again behind him at 3:45 man half cup can't get underneath bet that Lukas partner already has to clean here he's already the leader he hits the clean-and-jerk here he moves to 365  get underneath it we go to this partner still your overall leader full commitment on that split that's what I'm talking about about it deep split getting as low as you can don't eat that bar because the lower you were able to go the lowering or the higher you don't need to push some apartments high to get underneath it but that's commitment when saw dad McCain when he being is he actually caught the bar with bent arm so that's a difference right there that's something that's gonna hurt Chad as he gets up and continues on his heavier weight 265 that's Albert Dominique LaRouche behind him Jordan Troy and was the lead man on the ladder now as Chad McKay at 335 pounds [Music]  [Music] again let's see how deep chat can come out underneath desert nothing they have too much of a problem on the on the clean part especially that fronts why it's so strong out of the whole solid but here's where he really needs to take a deep split and go down as quick as you possibly can that right there you tried to push himself down instead of really shooting himself down to them underneath them okay we'll get three 35.1 just an Allen with a successful lip that he will await the next bar is his to back of Chad McKay  [Music]  for Chadwick aid and he's at a gas  [Music] Marcus hendren area as again fifth place out of the the craziest region that we have five people coming out of the region all five of those people were in the top ten last year coming out of the game just barely making it here but is doing just amazing so far this games he's having a great showing albear Jonica ruse on the left the 275 on the right Justin Allen at 325 pounds and Scott panchik right behind him at 315 Hendrik no hopple 35 yeah that was that was an easy lift that was a warm-up lift right there now last year in the games he was able to pull up 355 pounds in the clean didn't necessarily have the best form but just horse the weight up it does that that farmer that farm boy strength Justin Allen again  Wow well again nothing up there that's that they split power clean  just cannot stabilize an old boat addict with this on that's been to his elbows stabilized over again justin is so strong you can see what he can do I mean he basically tried to push all that up all by himself really didn't have any fun with that at all didn't get underneath the bar on his clean didn't split the right way it's clean though split his legs sideways and just didn't get underneath that bar that bar quick at all the man who has back-to-back victories Josh bridges who moved from 11th to 50 good lift for Bruce [Music]  being key to the bar there Scott panting 325 power clean magic  [Applause] and ruin no problem at 295 and again I think these are just a couple warm-up sets for him he knows when you can clean jerk maybe a little bit different what's he writing it up to but again how much warming up were they able to do back at the bullpen before they came out here it's also a little different to come out into this gigantic stadium and lift in front of you know 20,000 people the man who currently sits in fourth place overall Ben Smith he will start at 285 pounds Ben Smith even though he's been he's one of the younger athletes when he's known for is his snatching his clean and jerks he's room he if you look at him he doesn't seem like he'd be such a power horse but he is so strong and his form is so impeccable  and this right here is the games that he was hoping he had laughs here he's really making a run back at that podium Ben Smith just 63 points back of overall leader jason khalipa Scott panchik is currently the lead man on the ladder in Spanish now making a run at 335 pounds on the fair Dominica ruse at 295 Dominic is Jordan Troy at to 85 to 95  [Music] Angie cannot get that to his shoulders [Music] now Troy has one more chance to 285  [Music] seventy-five feet while judge bridges at 2:55 but he is still alive remember if you don't hit your opening weight you are out of the competition man she's making another run at 335 Scott panchik actually got himself a coach an actual boxer you know what all that technique is really helping him out he looks really good that was impressive again that speed underneath the bar and landing and catching solid it's exactly what everyone wants to be doing with their jerky  George Troian one more attempt to 285 pounds just collapse is underneath the bar again it's about keeping tight keeping all those all those joints tight this is a new PR for Scott panchik Wow what they power clean again and he hits it that jerk was solid the fact he's able to power P right now is a presence so that just means he's going to be able to get up those higher weights and then squat clean later at 345 pounds in the ER after doing all of this plus every event pretty incredible from Scott panchik trying to get the crowd fired up and behind him as he is setting up for his first attempt at 345 pounds on the right is Marcus hander and ended at 3:15 and Fargas hammer gets that lift now panting at 345 pounds for a new personal best [Music]  can't quite get that weight stabilizing stand it up again he needs to commit to that squat if he's going to go the squat underneath like that he has to commit pull himself down quickly and land in a solid tight position he can't okay you can't just kind of go half a nap on that you have to commit to it just can't quite standing up pant you guys a successful lift at 3:35  in 345 point one but he still won't stay alive without passing exiting the ladder and here comes the two-time defending prosecuted champion rich Froning he currently sits in second place overall and he is starting at 285 pounds now rich listed a PR of 370 pounds and what's gonna wonder why he started off so light and I think the only thing we can kind of speculate I think he wants to warm up into those lifts so really no reason for him to go heavier than he needs to why put that extra strain under so lift a couple extra piece of lighter weight there's no one perspective it's in fact speculated it but we'll see how he goes with this solid jerk quickly getting underneath that bar catching it with locked arm nice tight midline now bark is heavier it is your lead on the field Paragon standing up 315 pounds  and he is unable to get it so I'll bear dominique beluche on his second attempt still not able to get 315 pounds as there is you lead athlete Marcus header getting set to move up for the 335 pounds are behind him currently standing on the 305 lat Ben Smith behind Smith's Garret Fisher behind Fisher rich Froning  they have 80 seconds to complete that second transistor [Applause]  Marcus entrance setting up for 335 pounds  into that ladder is 375 pounds no one who got past 355 so right there Johnson bridges d5 look at his knees basically naked right now he came back from a catastrophic knee injury no nice leaves it all now that's why I witness what we didn't see him last year but he's pressing that way looking great here the crazy thing about that he didn't split that that was a squat jerk and that's not normally what you're gonna see you're gonna see a splinter Fargas and root at 3:35 just can't quite get that overhead Ben Smith had a successful listen that lifted 315 fissures good as it's groaning behind him so Marcus Henry that we can't get this weight overhead will leave the ladder [Applause] [Music] one more go now Marcus Andrew at 335 he goes back to the chalk bucket [Applause] [Music]  still some time left needs to hit this lip to stay alive on the ladder Wow again almost the power clean on that and now your overall leader Jason Khalifa is on the ladder and Khalifa has already cleared 285 pounds and he will move up to the 295 pounds are so he knows exactly where rich froning's records are on this so he has to do in every can to stay close to it doesn't want Brits to get too many points as he starts creeping his way up to the leaderboard Josh bridges currently in fifth place on the left at 305 solid lifts even without any sleeves or knee protection at all now watch his jerk bridges can't quite hold it underneath that but he won't get far slam for the Queen not bad Smith on the right at 325 now Ben Smith you know what I think that's pretty smart of him as he comes up against a little bounce he's looking for a rebound into that jerk I don't know if that would really work in like a USWA steady but here is all of it as long as you get that bar overhead that's a good lift that was smart that was a pretty pretty lift Josh bridges five he's already cleaned and now he needs to complete it with a clean and then the subsequent dirt to stay alive rich is coming in at fifth place the Benny's chasing on the bridges just can't quite stand that up so Britt is looking like he's going to leave the ladder the final score of three oh five point one  you know what that's that's not bad at all Josh did really well on that last then you needed that because you know the big boys are gonna push a lot of weight here it's still not too shabby for him this event pretty much damage control for Josh bridges Ben Smith in front behind him Garrett Fisher bridges just can't get 305 but does a good job on that ladder even in fifth place overall remember we have an event tonight that could be right in his wheelhouse inside the tennis stadium yep chance for him to get a third win of the competition on the left rich Froning at 3:15 on the right Ben Smith 335 rich Froning no problem at all but again let's watch Ben Smith Brad when he comes out of the wall going from his clean initially get me gets right into a jerk he gets a little bounce on the bar goes right into it here in Fisher just hit 325 [Music] where you would see most people getting to split on his hands and readjusting they're up there in his grip he goes right into the jerk after that Lucas Parker liking that lift is his crowd and spin now moving up to the 345 how far behind him is Derek Fisher mine Fisher is groaning that finally your overall leader jason khalipa watch this talk about efficiency I mean strong I don't even have any time to even say anything about any movement the bass and that's on the replay  335 pounds now Garrett Fisher the man who came in third place just 28 points out of the top spot he's a rookie I mean he's the new kid on every lock no not at all he's so he's so poised in this position right now again training partners in he had the people that he on a regular basis get to work out with his I mean nobody gets that opportunity yeah you want to get talking but he want to have I get thrown and there's a fire he's out there was some of the biggest names in the CrossFit Games got Ben Smith he got thrown e behind you got Felipa there's brownie and 325  behind him and jay-z Khalifa at 3:15 Fischer on the left of your screen behind Ben Smith at 3:35 he can get that overhead so now Ben Schmitt and 345 pounds this is 25 pounds over his listed PR right now so he's already PR himself today the whole first time he's stopped in between the clean of the jerk  can't quite get underneath it but partial credit for Ben Smith 345 point one still a super strength of the plan yeah it was at I'm here for Ben Smith  Garret Fisher he's going to exit the ladder the Ben Smith can't complete this slip he will exit he's already putting on the Hat Solar Sykes kids day it's done I think he's gonna think it's calling in a day so now the top two men still out on the ladder rich Froning and jason khalipa groping all he needs to do here is just stay one ahead of Kalifa and he's going to cut into that lead even more and get it down to single digits jason has a little bit of an advantage on this because he actually gets to see how rich does on each one of these lips he gets his few baubles or if there's any struggling rich doesn't get to see that with Jason though unless he beats into the hip 335 is good for bloating and al-khalifa and 325 and a good lift for jason khalipa two different techniques there yeah you know I just it wasn't that Jason doesn't have the prettiest form in both think but he's so strong and he's been working on these single box again it was a nice split he really needs to have a much more powerful and explosive dip-drive out of the hole  it's so strong so strong  again not a very dramatic split he needs to get underneath that weight a little bit more go a little bit deeper with this split the cats that wait now throw Network move up to the 345 pounds bar jason khalipa is right behind him he doesn't have to worry about just staying ahead of jason khalipa and taking another bite at the Khalifa's lead that is just 11 points we're coming into this 8 and 12 sport events the clean-and-jerk ladder the second of three events that will hold today Daniel Petro looking on as the overall leaders  pounds now it's Felipe at 3:35 front of the freaking crazy thing about rich Froning he doesn't have any sort of crazy setup he's on Lucas Parker's long-drawn-out rapini father Mitchell grabs it and goes Wow that's Felipa trying to match up yard he slipped off the bar soap roading now a really good spot to take over the lead for jason khalipa if khalipa cannot get this lift now depending how far rich needs to go he can really make up all his points right now picking it up past Lucas Parker that is going to be deadly to Jason these men are already torched if Brody finishes one a head to cleave it would just be five points difference in kalibo would hang on to lose now 335 Khalifa's photo looks off  [Applause]  again there's not the dip Drive in that dip that we're looking for after there's no speed underneath the bar just trying to use those big shoulders and press up our heads not gonna work with this heavy of a wave the jason khalipa did get the clean so far some credit three thirty five point one for him and just one man will remain on the ladder unless khalipa didn't make another run but he does not have enough time to set up for another attempt so rich Froning moving up to 355 pounds two men at pleadin neither jerk did though that was Lucas Parker and Asia Barroso now rich Froning Oh a little characteristic right there rich I think he did kind of jumped into a little bit too fast sometimes that means it didn't slow it down just a little bit but he just didn't get that far high enough up on his chest if Brody doesn't complete a queen here  he will only for this one ahead a Khalifa believer will surrender first a champ trying to get out not doing so rich Froning will cut into Jason Khalifa's lead it's going to be down to single digits will await the official scoring but it looks like jz Khalida will Silvermane it first place overall the two men who have stood up with this weight or on the right groaning is on your left he just can't hand it up be cheered on by Lucas Parker and Asia Bartow groaning still with some time he's gonna make another attempt he's the first guy to take four attempts in one wait that's a lot in 80 seconds not going to happen for Froning so 345 boy huge burning will be its final score and those are the two men who got 355 on their shoulders and they will tie for first place and the wind in event eight the clean-and-jerk ladder the second of three events today the third will be tonight in the tennis stadium and it's a repeat from the crossfit games of 2007 a 1000 meter row followed by five rounds 25 pull-ups at seven shoulder to overhead at 135 but first the clean-and-jerk ladder at the books Asia Porto 350 5.1 Lucas Parker is second and then rich Froning finishing in [Music] third place rich froning this is ahead of jason khalipa no so strong we so used to seeing him do everything that he wants to do it's all characteristic to see evidence those at 3:00 at the 355 but strong lips before that real impressive the tie for first was between these two Asia part Oh Lucas Parker look at the height difference there we have one of the shorter athletes of five seven Lucas Parker - one of the tallest athletes at the age of Bartow it's six five so when they'd say which is it better to be taller short in Olympic lifting I don't know these guys just answered the question it doesn't matter just do your thing  [Music] Lucas Parker finally getting a victory here he was way back in the standings to start this event Lucas Parker came in 37th overall and he was a man as a veteran who has continued to move up the standing of the past two years he's been at the games but he is on track for his worst finish but aja Bartow and Lucas Parker helping their causes with a victory and look at rich Froning who finishes way ahead of jason khalipa that right there is that's gonna be detrimental to Jason I mean even though we had a lot of people that tied in seventh place as long as rich keeps moving he's gonna start eating up that lead and that's exactly what he's doing and he very well could have done it in this event we're gonna wait for the official results to update the tie for first here it is the Texas behemoth and the bearded Canadian I mean it's fun to watch agilent's he's just so tall because he's so big he moved the other things moving slow but you can't beat the screaming or the beard of Lucas Parker that's mad half tuck behind him at 3:35 both of them making a lot of noise on those lists and look at this rich waited to come back he is now in the first place by six points over jason khalipa Josh bridges dropping to seventh but still more events to go here the barbells are going to be put away at the scene him and we're gonna move into the tennis stadium stay with us live coverage from the 2013 Reebok CrossFit Games continues [Applause]", "BCuwDhmiOFQ": "This is 30 days working out like Chris Hemsworth. So about two months ago I got very sick while traveling overseas I fell into a felt like the worst shape of my life when I fully recovered I vowed I would never take my health for granted I around this time I noticed that Chris Hemsworth my celebrity crush was about to release a fitness app called centr Hemsworth is an international movie star absolutely shredded workout monster and all-around a legendary real-life superhero his fitness app gives you access to his personal team of industry professionals who help him get into superhero shape the goal of this video is simple I'm going to be doing the workouts meal prep and meditation from the center app combined with the heavy weight training program that Chris did to see if I can get a body like Thor so for the next 30 days I'm going to workout and diet like Chris Hemsworth just gonna do a little 360 here so you can see what we're starting with definitely bring in the gut a little bit back a little bit more definition here yeah this is the starting point before we jump into this here the rules with any meaningful goal there needs to be a deadline number two no processed sugar it actually pains me to do this number three no alcohol and finally zero cheat meals stick to the diet 100% with that today is day number one I just downloaded the app now the main page here it's your daily planner and that's where it breaks down your workouts your meals and even your meditation the first workout of today is a maximum effort box and cardio challenge oh yeah I I grew up swimming and wrong so my hand-eye coordination isn't the best but that's why we're doing this get out of the comfort zone get some muscles while the expert trainers from Chris's team aren't here in this room with me they are on the app and the workouts are coming directly from his trainers so all this challenge is gonna come down to self discipline first workout has done it a lot harder than I thought I'm dripping in sweat from that now we have to wait work out the second portion of this training program is going to be mainly weightlifting I found this workout from researching on the internet what Chris did to get all ripped up for the Avengers films for Thor so the weightlifting portion is gonna be mainly compound movements with pretty heavy weight and it's broken down by body parts so today is chest day so we're doing some flat bench it's two workouts per day cardio or a functional fitness workout from the app in the morning then weights in the second session the weight training is pure bodybuilding workouts it's just time under tension to failure and of day number one my chest is already sore and my shoulders from the boxing my tired scale one to ten probably like a 9.5 I mean you can kind of see bags under the eyes and that no sleep day number two tomorrow end of week number one biggest challenge so far has been the just the workouts I'm doing workouts that I've never even heard of before and I'm soaring places that I didn't even know really existed all my body like at the hip right here is sore the inner thighs the food has been very tough seven eggs spinach typical breakfast we got some peas some broccoli some lentils and of course our best friend the chicken breast now for this challenge I'm cooking all of my own meals the meals are consisting of lots of veggies lots of good carbohydrates lots of proteins I'm consuming a calorie surplus about 4,500 calories per day based on my body weight and how you to put on muscle I'm not talking to bad calories I'm not talking a white chocolate I'm talking I'm talking to lean proteins good fats this is a typical meal but at the end of the first week I am giving absolutely crushed by the workouts although I'm starting to see a little bit of definition in my arms but I'm just grinding away putting in the work towards that end goal so it's day 15 I am at the midway point of this 30-day challenge and I feel amazing like the first week it was I feel sore I can't move this week it's like wow I've actually have some some muscle definition coming in the changes have been pretty ridiculous I'm actually very shocked my strength is up I've been recording the weights as I'm going it's amazing the increases week by week it's such a short amount of time honestly the easiest part of this has been the 5:00 a.m. wake up's 5:15 in the morning and when you have a solid reason why all your other actions like waking up at 5:00 in the morning Monday through Friday they become pretty simple they become justified it it's doing something day in and day out over and over again on those days when no one's watching when everyone's asleep warm in their beds workouts are still very hard daily discomfort that's what this is the hardest part is still the diet I am eating so much food constantly eating everyone says it but until you actually are doing it I is the hardest thing the diet will make or break a transformation or fitness goal something that I didn't expect was how much I would be relying on the meditation portion of this app start by making yourself very comfortable I have fallen asleep to that the past three nights in a row the meditation aspect especially after a long day I mean I have no complaints I am actually very blown away by how this has gone so far I'll see you in 15 days for the final reveal this is 30 days working out like Chris Hemsworth I mean as you can see like I have I have a six-pack now looking at the pictures from the star of this I don't even feel like the same person all around they feel strong I feel healthy I feel fast I feel fit that's how I would describe I feel very fit it is possible to get in shape by yourself after just 30 days I'm pretty close to being in the best shape of my life I'm able to power through these workouts compared to at the beginning of this challenge where I was sucking wind barely able to complete these workout circuits and now I'm pushing myself as far as I can go wanting more wanting more of a challenge and Chris if you are watching this I want to say a massive thank you for making this app and sharing just a little bit of what makes you successful comment down below if you're interested in seeing a 60 day follow-up video and with that I'll see you in the next video", "IaBg1XzDnSU": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]  [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  oh my god okay I'm exhausted I'm not as good a shape as I thought I was thank God I didn't put the heels on I thought okay it's 4:30 I'm not changing to heels I'm gonna wear the tennis shoes for y'all I hope you don't mind right okay I'm seriously winded oh  so I have a question for you what's your next chapter I'm dead serious what is the next chapter of your life I don't care how young you are how old you are I want to turn the tables back on you I want you to think about where you've been I want you to think about why are you here there is a new chapter starting in your life in your business in your relationships and it's gonna start right now so what is it you know I've been thinking about this a lot because I'm in the middle of starting a new chapter I I've been thinking I don't know how many of you know me or know my story but I'm gonna tell you a little bit about it the last chapter of my life my professional life started about six years ago so six years ago I gave this TED talk this TEDx talk and you know by the way this was the first time I had ever given a speech so this is if you want to see what it looks like for somebody to have a 21 minute long panic attack this is a great speech to watch and you know what was I talking about well you know I was asked to come and talk about how I had changed my career so many times because I had been the kind of person that really could never figure out what the heck I should do with my life I had gone to law school because I couldn't figure out what to do I practiced criminal defense for a long time then I went into corporate litigation then I went into the dot-com scene then I got into the entrepreneurial scene that I got into the coaching scene then I into the media business and I was a syndicated talk show host on the radio for a while and then I worked for CNN and I never thought I would be a speaker never in a million years so I was giving this talk and it was to talk more about how you change and at the end I let a little secret slip you see I had discovered something at a terrible time in my life how many of you know what the five-second rule is not the one with the food on the floor you know where you drop it okay great thank you for raising your hands if you'll if you'll just give me a couple minutes I'm gonna I'm gonna bring everybody else into the party that didn't raise their hand so in 2008 my husband's restaurant business started going under and it took our house our entire life savings and almost our marriage with it and thankfully it didn't take the marriage but it took all the money and at the time I was also unemployed and and I was facing an issue where I just felt like about myself excuse the word but I did have you ever felt that way yeah the alarm would go off in the morning and all I could think about her all the things that were wrong with my life you ever wake up and you feel that sense of dread you got a job you hate going to you got a body that you don't like you just don't feel that good well that was me every single morning and I was also doing a lot making a lot of decisions that were pretty bad I was drinking a lot I was not that nice to my husband and I was really really struggling because I was really scared see I was doing a lot of things that caused me pain because I was in a lot of pain well what ended up happening is one night I I I was watching a commercial and I saw this rocket ship launching and I thought oh my god that's the answer that's it right there tomorrow morning when the alarm goes off because I was hitting the snooze button over and over and over again tomorrow morning when that alarm goes off I am going to rock it out of that bed like a rocket ship I'm gonna move so fast that I cannot talk myself out of getting up now it might have been the four manhattan's I had had that night that gave me that dumb idea but you know whatever I'm gonna take the inspiration where it comes so the next morning the alarm goes off and I'll never forget this you guys it was a Tuesday it was February we had lost the kids college savings there was a lien on her house Chris was sleeping on the couch I was unemployed I felt like the world's worst parent I felt like them just no confidence no idea how he's gonna dig myself out of this hole the alarm goes off and and it was weird it was like time suspended immediately as I laid there in bed I started thinking I started thinking about all the things that were wrong I started thinking about the dread that I felt I started thinking about off another terrible day I just don't have the energy for this and then I did something I had never done before I could feel the doubt closed in as I was lying there thinking I went 5 4 3 2 1 and I stood up and I was like what the hell just happened 5 4 3 2 1 that's a dumbest thing I've ever heard the next morning the alarm goes off I didn't feel like getting up still had all the same problems I went 5 4 3 2 1 I stood up now that I'm almost 50 when the alarm goes off at 2:00 Thor wouldn't the body alarm goes off and I have to go the bathroom I don't lay there and think about it 5 4 3 2 1 I get up and go lying there it's very hard to go back to sleep isn't it so a funny thing happened as I started to use this stupid rule okay as I started to use this rule a minute count backwards 5 4 3 2 1 if I know I should do something my whole life started to change you see what I'm about to prove to you today is that your entire life is happening in five-second windows that the secret to greater confidence the secret to beating self-doubt the secret to building that legacy to being hungry but less was talking about five-second windows 5 second decisions  I made myself a promise as I started to beat the habit of hitting the snooze button I said to myself look if I find myself in a situation where I know what I should do but I don't feel like doing it I'm gonna use this stupid rule so I went 5 4 3 2 1 and get up and I'd walk into the kitchen and I'd see Chris and we still had all these financial problems that I'd go want to strangle you because it's easier to point the finger isn't it at other people you ever notice when you're pointing the finger at other people and blaming and shaming and complaining there's always three pointing right back at you isn't there I think it's the universe or God's Way of saying hey the power is in you but when you don't feel confident you don't feel that the power is in you do you you feel full of doubt so slowly but surely I started making five second decisions I would see the booze and I knew I shouldn't have and I go 5 4 3 2 1 and I turn away and see the phone and knew I needed to make a phone call to get a job and I'd go 5 4 3 2 1 and everything started to change now in full disclosure I was never gonna tell anybody about this ever cuz it sounds so stupid oh you guys want to change your life no problem just count to five done okay mic drop I'm out that's it here's the other thing I had no idea why it worked I honestly thought like I was a witch I had figured out a spell I understood like how to create magic in my head and here's the other thing this was classified this was my stuff why would I want you to have it this was working for me I suddenly went from depressed drinking in bed in debt fighting with my husband to getting up getting in shape getting sober for a while  getting a job getting a radio show making that radio show syndicate making more money than I ever thought was possible how one five-second decision at a time so I never intended to tell anybody because it was working for me it was working for Chris and then I get and I do this talk and I'm having a panic attack and I totally forget where I am and at the very end I'm like oh by the way there's this thing called the five-second rule Wow so 2011 was when that chapter of my life started I walked off that stage they put that thing on line and it's almost 11 million views strong at this point yes now the five-second rule for those of you that are wondering is this it's super simple the moment you begin to hesitate count 5 4 3 2 1 do not do it out loud you will scare people you sound insane 5 4 3 2 1 ok here I'm ready to go don't count up you can keep going you're gonna count backwards 5 4 3 2 1 and then you got a move and you've got to do this so that your mind doesn't stop you and in a minute I'm gonna explain you I'm gonna explain some of the science but I want to tell you kind of some of the backstory so you know a funny thing happened as that talk started to spread people from around the world started to write and we've heard from more than a quarter of a million people in 90 countries now what do you suppose they write about they write about that stupid five-second rule but the things that they write about her crazy profound so you know this gentleman started using it and he's on pace to double his business in 18 months more importantly he's so present with his kids going 5 4 3 2 1 and waking up in the moment that he's like dad of the year we see people using the rule in order to find the courage to reach out to people we see people using it in a selling situation because you know thinking about making the call won't make the call happen thinking about making sales funny that doesn't grow your business does it makes you smart doesn't make you rich easy rule to teach to people you're gonna become addicted to it because it's so stupid and it works you're gonna be surprised it works it's free it's unbelievable we know if people around the world that are also quitting terrible habits and we're to talk a little bit about habits today we also see people that are becoming more productive we know of at least 21 people that have stopped themselves from committing suicide because no matter what I don't care how amazing your life is or how low it gets your inner wisdom is always with you always and the key to getting what you want and we're going to talk about the next chapter of your life that starts today is having the clarity to tune into that wisdom having the courage to listen to it and having the confidence to actually take action now if you wanted the license plate it's gone and I need to say do not use this to get a tattoo and if you decide that you're going to I am NOT responsible yes this keeps happening so that's kind of my story okay it started in 2011 and and it created this incredible speaking career and I wrote this book that that is gone and exploded in terms of reaching and spreading the idea and take the five-second rule start using it it's free it works walk out of here and try it but that brings me back to you because I've kind of had this feeling lately that a new chapter is starting do you feel that way I think so because I think that's why you're here there is a new chapter starting and I had something really weird happen to me the other day so the new chapter for me is is all about doing more work where I can connect with people doing less work where I'm on a stage and I don't get to talk to people in terms of the exchange you walk out of here I may never see you again I hope not I hope not but doing more work like creating courses and creating more content online so I can stay connected to you so last week I did this course at creativeLIVE where I taught my first course seven hours long live with them it's terrified absolutely terrifying and I had this sense I said the night before I said as we were there rehearsing before we're about to do this course I feel like this is the beginning of a new chapter I really do and I'm one of those kind of weird people that I believe in signs you see I think that it's a sign that you're sitting here right now so that night right before the class I'm kind of freaking out I say to my business partner can you pick somewhere that we can go so we can work and she says sure and I said just pick a hotel somewhere so we can go get some work done and so we happened in the car have no idea where we're going and we pull and I realize oh my god holy cow this is the hotel that I stayed in the night before that TEDx talk and there is the building where I gave that talk I had come full circle check this out [Music]  we are at the st. Regis Hotel in San Francisco and I'm freaking out because when i walked in i realized that in 2011 which is six years ago i stayed in this hotel and gave the TED talk that TEDx talk that's gone viral that launched my career that helped me spread the five-second rule I gave that TED talk across the street from here we walked into this hotel randomly and tomorrow I am teaching a course on the science of confidence with creative life and this is the beginning of the next phase of my career being the content creator having a company that creates courses and moving into the realm of influencer and out of the realm of corporate speaker and I feel so freaked out because I look for signs in life and this is a sign that I've come full circle I am completing this six year chapter of my career and I'm back to the place where it started to launch the next one cool right now that was about me but here's this what's your next chapter see I would do my job if I got you all so in action that you were on stage next year right that's right because your doubts are creating mountains the reason why I'm here is I'm going to show you how to move them we're gonna cover a couple things here the title of the talk was break the habit of self-doubt and rock confidence so what we're gonna talk about is confidence what is it because a lot of us don't understand it I know I didn't understand it I had not the real confidence I had the fake kind you know they're really bossy annoying in kind where it was really driven by insecurity what we want to talk about is real confidence the other thing we're to talk about is the habit of self-doubt the habit of self-doubt so believe it or not self-doubt is a habit it's a behavior a thinking pattern that you repeat over and over and then it becomes automated and when I can get you to understand that anxiety worry procrastination self-doubt they are all habits then I can show you using science how you can break them and then everything changes and it all comes back to these five second decisions if you had more confidence how would your business and life change for the better I'm gonna tell you how mine had when I finally learned what confidence is and what it isn't number one I know how to say no how many of you have a hard time saying no you have clients who can't stand you have people that work for you that drain you the ability to align your goals with values and actions fearless negotiator fearless greater self control by the way let me stop there for a second because I believe that in today's world this is the number one skill for you self control and we're gonna give you tools today there to give it to you you're gonna make a lot more money and you're gonna be a happier human being absolutely and I'm gonna show you how to do it we can talk about change all you want but I'm the kind of person that's about real advice for real people and that's gonna require some real action so as I'm talking I want you to notice what are the physical sensations the feelings that come up in your body when I ask you how would your life change if you had more confidence and you have an answer do you feel yourself shrinking do you feel yourself talking yourself out of raising your hand because if I can get you to start to isolate that pattern and that habit simply and how you respond to whether or not you're gonna answer this question if I can break that right there so that you learn to try I almost fell off a minute okay there's a thing you learn to try thank you but it's like sir crowd-surf right now you got me okay then you can bring that anywhere I'm into experiential learning because you know I got this Lexia I'm a DV it's really hard for me to read and retain so if I feel it if I have to do it then it sticks so talk about the myths and the truths about confidence okay number one confidence is a personality trait total baloney total baloney lots of extroverted people that are really bossing and annoying like I used to be although I might still be a little annoying but really insecure really insecure there's a lot of introverted folks that feel uncomfortable putting themselves out there but they're they really believe in what they're saying so confidence is not a personality trait confidence is fixed that's not true you could be the most confident person in the world and the person that you love leaves you that's gonna rock confidence you could be a really great business person and then make a really bad decision and blow it all that's gonna rock you number three the confidence starts with belief this is where I go against so many other people I actually believe that this is not true I think that thinking positive thoughts will certainly make you feel better in the moment but it's not going to create change that you want that you can be a negative frustrated depressed anxiety ridden son of a gun and you can still take action and that taking action is key you see here's the truth about confidence first of all it's not a skill it's a trait and that's good news I'm excuse me it's not a trait oh it's a skill it's not a trait see dyslexia and full display I was not lying about that confidence is a skill it's not a trait confidence is situational so there are areas of your life where you are confident and then there are areas of your life where you have a ton of doubt and here's the most important one confidence begins with action now this is not something that I made up and in a second I'm going to show you the science I want you to write this quote down if you have a problem that can be solved with action you don't have a problem  so a lot of us talk about the problems that we have but they're actually not problems we're stuck in one of the traps of self-doubt and that's what we're gonna be talking about in just a second but first I want to show you how you build confidence and let's let's look at the research because there's really really strong research on this if you want more information on this just google the confidence competency loop the confidence competency loop let me show you what this is so basically if you try something either you're gonna succeed or he's going to survive now what happens if you survive it like you really blow it but you survived it well you learned something and then when you learn something what are you doing you're building skills and when you're building skills at something what are you gaining competency all competency means is that by learning something over and over and over again you have to do less thinking about it so you don't have time to get anxious just like me and the bed I had time to lay there so I was thinking about all my problems the more you do something the more that you try the more you build skill and competency and that is where confidence comes so I want you to walk out of here not only with the 5 4 3 2 1 catch yourself when you feel yourself shrinking catch yourself when you feel yourself editing yourself or silencing yourself I also want you to walk out of here with a brand new definition of confidence which I'm going to give to you in a second because check this out all of us are gonna feel failure let me show you what happens when you are afraid of failing when you're when you're fearing it first of all you're gonna start thinking aren't you oh I don't know if I want to give a speech I might be really bad at it and then I don't know what I want to talk about and I'm not really sure am I writing am I not ready should I wear the tennis shoes should I wear the heels should I not know this should I do this and then of course as you think you're gonna start to doubt yourself and this becomes this loop this is what researchers call a habit loop we're gonna get more into this this is a chunk of behavior that gets encoded in this part of your brain you see you don't you're not a doubter you have a habit of doing it the same is true by the way when you feel nervous you start overthinking the same is true when you start feeling insecure the same is true when you feel like the fake the same is true when you start to get overwhelmed the same is true when you start to fear rejection all of those things normal it's normal to be afraid of being rejected it sucks it's normal to feel nervous these feelings are normal acting nervous is a choice there's only one way to break a habit loop you have to insert a different behavior pretty neat huh see we spend way too much time with the red arrows I got to be fearless I can't never I can't ever worry I you know I it's terrible to feel like a fake no it's not it's normal in fact you're going to when you first relaunch your eco adventure company you're gonna feel like a fake that is normal acting like one is a choice so the only way to break the habit of self-doubt and thinking is to take action and what action are you gonna take 5 4 3 2 1 and that if you do it over and over what's a new habit in place this is how you build confidence 1 5 second decision at a time let me show you a little bit more science so right here is your brain and the red part right there that's the basal ganglia that's where all your habit loops get encoded everything that you do that you don't think about worrying let me give you another example when you put on your pants do you put your right or your left leg in first you're thinking about it aren't you you don't when you pull your jeans on it's a pattern of behavior that is right here here's the other problem this is also where worry is this is where anxiety is this is where depression is this is where self-doubt is it's all right here this is where procrastination is what happens when you go 5 4 3 2 1 is you activate the prefrontal cortex what you know is the part of the brain that you need for strategic thinking for acting with courage for changing so the truth is in five seconds you can change anything and that changes everything and I want you to understand that to feel more confident about the things that you want to do in your next chapter it begins with being willing to try so if confidence is the decision to try because I also like the idea of you not thinking that the big topics like confidence are about how you feel I want to make them action based because you can't control how you feel at times but you can always choose how you act so if confidence is the decision to try here's the definition of self-doubt it's the decision not to see one of the things that I've come to realize is that when you talk about self-doubt it's such a big term that you tend to think that it's just nothing that you can control but what if you started to consider that self-doubt is actually a decision it's gonna give you a lot of power now remember I told you that your doubts create mountains and your actions move them so let me show you the four traps of self-doubt this is really incredible stuff so the four traps of self-doubt because I just said confidence is about an action self-doubt is a decision not to try and there are four ways for actions that we all engage in that are you deciding not to try here they are hesitating hiding hypercritical and helplessness so I'm gonna unpack these for you and I want you to be thinking for a minute I want you to think about that next chapter and as I roll these out I want you to think about are you stuck in this and by the way I can relate to every single one of these so when I think about the next chapter of getting into throwing events and and creating more and more courses and doing bigger and bigger things I can see myself and every single one of these okay so this is normal stuff and when you start to break it apart now you've got the power to change it so hesitation what does this look like first of all it's triggered by answer t so if you feel uncertain about the changes that you want to make you're gonna fall into this trap you're gonna start hesitating you're gonna find yourself waiting you're gonna start overthinking you're gonna want your work to be perfect who is struggling with hesitation right now okay come on up here Kelly Jo hop up can you climb out there yeah get up here let's go Oh God this way you visualize she visually we give her the round of applause please  is this the mic where's the mic oh here's the mic round of applause please just like yes thank you okay okay you're gonna pee your pants this would be amazing it's normally it's me doing that on stage okay hi so what is the next chapter that you want in your life like what is it that you're working on I was this right now to be here what do you mean I wanted at this conference to stand on this stage and then because I have stage fright it terrifies the out of me right now my voice is quivering now interesting what's happening in your body my voice is shaking what else I feel like my chest is gonna cave in what else I'm really hot are you sweating it no but my head hurt and now I don't the clammy hands yeah tightness in the throat very much how many of you kind of feel that for her yes those are your miracles right now you can feel all of that stuff and you can take action this is exactly what I'm talking about so what is it that you really want to do that you're hesitating which would you wait do you ever think which one are you doing uncertainty yeah uncertainty overthinking so what do you want to create what's the next chapter for you I want to give a voice to kids that have been sexually abused and let them let them know that they can talk about it Wow  now how are you hesitating how are you stuck in this trap what are the things that you're doing tell on yourself hmm hmm well I didn't know that wasn't answer till just now but uh I honestly have no idea right now right now I can hardly see I'm so excited that's okay okay so come back to me so what are the things that you do that stop you from moving forward I get scared that I'm not gonna be able to provide for my kids okay what do you currently do I work in sales okay and so you basically tell yourself a story you're over thinking that if I do this then like it's one or the other no I mean like I kick ass in sales great and you do that wonderfully like okay it's just who I am this right here standing here and feeling like my story is important it's not easy because you're a survivor - yes so am I  it starts with the willingness to try do you see this but actually hearing what was in here and being brave enough five four three two one it starts with that otherwise you get trapped in hesitating you get trapped in thinking well I'm so good in sales I can't even possibly start that but I got so much going on I couldn't possibly find the time Who am I to do that I don't even know but I'd have stage fright right yep so the thing that I want you to understand what is one thing let's leverage the progress principle do you guys know the progress principle this is fantastic research from the Harvard Business School that just came out where there was a really fastidious professor that studied thousands and thousands and thousands of people and their daily work she made him keep journals and then she crunched all the data it's on the journal to figure out what makes somebody have a great day at work what makes somebody come home and feel like they've gotten a lot done what makes them feel productive it was really simple super simple did they make progress on one thing that mattered to them today that's it so this is your one thing that matters to you and so what I want you to do leaving here and for all of you that fall into this category hesitating I did this with the event thing the event side of my business that I want to do been doing this for years overthinking this thing coming up with reasons over thinking over thinking if this is you I want you to leverage the progress principle I want you every morning to write down one thing that mattered like that that you can do just one thing today forward is forward I don't care how small it is and then five four three two one find five minutes to just inch that ball down the field because what happens is when you start to see yourself taking action on something that's important to you like giving a voice to survivors of sexual abuse whether it's just researching or taking the online course or just buying a book or just having a conversation or just why chinga video if you do that every single day what happens is you start to see yourself becoming the kind of person that's doing it this is the secret to everything everything I cannot stress this enough and I cannot thank you enough for your bravery okay of course yeah I better take this okay there we go good job okay here's another one hiding hiding hiding is triggered by fear hiding is triggered by fear if you're hiding you know if you're hiding cuz you avoid people right a lot of people in Direct Selling do this right you know who you want to call but you're not gonna call him nope or you're in a meeting and you're silent or you see somebody want to meet and you're silent you're being a chicken I was a big chicken about money for a while I hid a lot in this category procrastinating all right who's next who sees himself art Julie oh hold on you're great Julie come up at you're in the pink hair you're next okay come on Julie get up here give her a round of applause she's doing the work for all of us Wow okay she's not hiding anymore okay yes hi are you we hold this and I crush on you right you do cool so what is your next chapter so I want to open up a national chain of nutrition companies like a nutrition say you can feel these things and you can keep moving okay see she's doing the work for you for all of us this is what it looks like to try the feelings are normal letting them stop you that's a choice you guys want to hear my heart we can no be your radiance so I am a nutritionist and have a small office and I've been hiding and helping people but I want to take it larger like a big Jenny Craig type of thing but more natural like helping people figure out their issues and support and accountability do you see hiding as a choice you see that hiding is a choice yes okay and what are you afraid of why are you hiding I'm scared I'm scared what are you scared I guess I'm scared of failure yeah okay you're the failure and I'm I'm afraid my life is gonna change and I'll be so busy that I won't be able to go on vacation or hang out with my kids or yeah who can relate to that yeah you know what's so interesting about that is that when you're afraid of failure and you don't take action you kind of feel like a failure don't you mmm-hmm cuz your dream wants you a little bit yeah so the thing that you're most afraid of you've already got cuz you're you're really you're really struggling underneath this big dream that you have so in terms of hiding so if you're somebody that hides the key is is literally literally baby steps the other thing that I'm gonna tell you about the hiding self-doubt trap is that you're always gonna be terrified it's always gonna feel like a big deal and so expect it to okay expect it to so the other thing I want you to do is because the other thing that people do that hide is you here how big it is did you hear national chain now that is the dream but what could the next chapter be that's not so scary local so let's start with I want you leaving here and the next chapter of your life is actually launching the first prototype does that make sense now what is something that you can do tomorrow that would force you out of your shell and to not hide to inch forward one action toward a local find a location or research do some sort of research on building yes this is exactly right you don't know you're building competency you don't know how do you figure it out you push yourself to try and it doesn't matter what you try you got to look at buildings you got to look at other concepts you've got to read a book on the business you got to talk to people in the business this is what's so exciting about the next chapter you're gonna figure it out got it okay good give her a round of applause I love you all right let me give you the other one and then we'll bring you up I'll bring you up you can come up while I explain this okay so the next one hyper critical so this is when you lawyer things to death this is when you argue against yourself and this is usually triggered by past failures so if you're somebody that got burnt in a relationship and you're busy arguing I'm not doing online dating I'm never dating again if you've got burnt and business and you are worried about starting again you argue against yourself so there are things that are opportunities and yet you're the one that's so critical and if this isn't you it might be somebody in your life where you see the greatness in them and they're like yeah I don't know and and you always focus on the reasons why you can't like you can't even see the possibility you fixate on what could go wrong your stress has an edge to it so hiding is quiet and avoiding hesitating is very busy this has an edge okay come on up here give her a round of applause  hi how are you nice to meet you come on over here let's go in the middle so everybody can see you okay so what is it that you would like to change what's your next chapter my next chapter is actually moving forward I've taken a huge leap and I've left my full-time job without really if any kind of a financial plan in place like my family does not have health insurance right now um and I'm in direct sales and also building businesses I'm not exactly sure where it's going right now but it has been in the making for 20 years like literally I took my profession that took me off to the side let me ask you what is it that is what are you doing to get in your own way where is the type of self-doubt whether it's hiding hesitating hypercritical it's hesitating and hypercritical okay and I'm staying too busy to focus on continuing to make that so what is the one thing that you need to be doing so for those of you that are arguing against yourself you're hyper critical you're negative I guarantee you you know the thing that you need to be doing it might be cold calls it might be getting out there more in talking about your business this one we see a lot in people trying to build a direct selling business that you argue against yourself instead of getting into action so let's tell one on yourself what is the one thing that you need to be doing that you constantly avoid or talk yourself out of I'm not getting out there and recruiting and building my team because I'm afraid I'm I'm afraid that I haven't provided enough for my family and the people that I already have and so I just tell myself I I really don't deserve to have more because I'm not taking care of what I currently have that must be paralyzing yeah okay so you've got two choices two choices and you're gonna make a decision right now you're either gonna go get a job so that you don't have that excuse anymore that's option a or you're going to every time you catch yours you're gonna make a little plan in the morning of the things you need to do and you know exactly what they are and when you catch yourself shrinking hiding complaining you're gonna go five four three two one because in five seconds flat self-doubt procrastination can derail you or you can step in and push yourself forward door number a find a job and therefore we remove the excuse order number B give yourself a timeline you've got two months to get this done and every day you are going to push yourself what's your choice five four three two one let's go every day make a choice move forward great I want you to do this for two months if after two months you have not made this happen you need to get a job so that you are providing the insurance for your family but I want to give you a two-month runway to absolutely crush it you got it good okay thanks excellent all right final one the final one is helplessness and I realized I want I need to have a man come up here triggered by insecurity or low self-worth you're what set you're ready he's ready he's hopeless so get up here okay he's hungry oh he's hungry okay so helplessness by the way if you actively play the big victim if you know the solution if you know the solution if you say nothing ever goes my way if you've got all the excuses in the book this is this trap these are all actions by the way hey he's hungry okay good I'm great actually this is pretty awesome right now awesome yes five four three two one I just finished listening to the book awesome you're the one yes um two weeks so what is it that you want to change what are you working on what's the next chapter Sterns today the nice chapter in my life right now is to create an altitude of vision to help people heal their spirits while building their body Wow yes so does that mean I don't mean to be rude but is that like personal training no what does it mean okay it's it's it's a personal experience personal experience yes I lost 55 pounds six years ago outstanding and now I'm helping others do the same okay so I want to I'm part of a business a part of a partnership and I want to take that to a more deeper level okay so now let me quantify that me so here's another mistake that we all make so I get the vision cuz you can feel as he's talking the passion right but I don't hear any specifics so if you find yourself in the Dreaming space and you can't get anything from this level to this level is that like from here to here the problem is we're not talking specifics so either you're not talking like I make a hundred grand right now in my business and I want to get to seven figures or I make seventeen dollars and I want to get to 1,700 this month so if you're in that space if people don't quite get where you're talking about or you don't know what to do next you're not specific enough got it so quickly where is your business now and what does it look like in the next chapter specifically is it a money bridge is it a what is it it's it's a mental branch to me I just feel like right now I'm at the beginning stage it's funny that I'm here right now cuz yesterday I was with my lady who was at the house and I created a plan already great I wrote everything down on a piece of paper then I put it to the side outside watching Netflix oh of course right watch the Netflix okay the plan your business is on Netflix okay but again that is driven by the habit of self-doubt right you get confronted by the plan so we choose to go over here you hide right you can now catch yourself five four three two one here's the thing what does it look like if the business is launched is there a location no okay how many clients do you need to have paying you before this will be launched how many clients paying you at least six a week six clients a week paying you what $50 an hour $50 an hour by when are we doing that October 2nd October 2nd I would have given you a dollar if you said October 6 cuz that's my birthday but there we go okay October 6 there we go you got a dollar I'll set it okay so six clients a week paying $50 yes an hour by October 6 yes do you hear the difference you guys we have just defined what it means for him to relate to this as the business is launched it is now out of up here and now that we have defined the dream it's become a plan not a dream amen got it yes ma'am okay good go do it awesome thank you you're welcome again god bless you  you", "-WKmM4kkL0g": "of the cm ex3d then wrist watch your goal for new things

these Because they are part of it Disguised money Hypocritical teacher False assets I know the game of the rich My rich dad taught me You know because you are a banker Banker is a rich player It's different from what they taught you in school in this world How does the school teach you money? The answer is: nothing This is neither an error Not by accident I know, most people also know Ways to keep the middle class working hard Is never to teach them what the rich know So if you read \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" published in 1997 A book on how rich people teach their children about money The poor and the middle class did nothing Poverty is hurt I mean, I don't like this And I don't like that our academic system is so corrupt We know the banking system is corrupt We know political corruption But academia is equally corrupt I think banking and politics are the same thing But this is where we send the kids We believe they will do the right thing for children however They are not taught so basic Just like when you asked your father when you were a kid Ask your teacher When do you tell or teach us about money? Then they just Say nothing I will never tell you what do you know? Share it What is financial education? It is not Get a job, work hard or save money And invest in a diversified portfolio of investment finance Stocks, funds or ATF The financial industry contains two things: debt and taxes Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard in 1971 This turned the dollar into debt However, we still tell children to learn and get jobs Work hard, save money and get out of debt Who is telling them to do this? This is simply ridiculous The first line of the book says Saving money will make you rich Actually, it never will, you know We are all taught to be children Why do you save money? Why do you work for it If they can be printed Faster than you work for it Why do you keep it when it is printed? The rich never work for money You don't touch those things This is a very delicate right, isn't it? They won't say I will train you to be a worker bee for the rest of your life But they somehow teach you where to go This is why you came here What else? What do they want to do? What did you do for them in the first few months? What is he trying to get from you? Because he teaches you how to get money Let's try to say if you are ready to succeed in life You need to find the best teacher And a good teacher always comes from inside, not from outside But at school you do n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Is your mentor true or false This is the source of hypocritical teachers I said: I want you to teach me money Why should I teach you? But if I teach you, you need to work for me for free Then I said: Why is it free? My dad, my poor dad got angry, he said If I pay you, you will think like an employee Your brain will change If you learn to never work for money You will become rich This is a right, once you give someone a salary Their brains will shut down Then the promise of pensions One job guarantee This is the disguised salary After you stop working Give this man a fish, eat it for a day, and teach him how to fish Can eat for a lifetime Most poor people are confused Assets and liabilities They think their house is an asset and a liability Yes Assets are nouns, like a house Cash is liquid, is a verb So to understand whether it is assets or liabilities Like a noun plus a verb If cash flows out of your pocket It is debt If cash goes into your pocket, money flows It is an asset I own 7000 properties for rent They are all assets and have cash inflows every month Many people have big houses on the hill But cash out Then they are going bankrupt It's like a frame of mind Another thing the poor don't understand is For most people, the most important expense is taxes Yes, we haven't even seen it, isn't it weird? You look around You look at your salary and say they are a bit wrong But you didn't realize The government has put a huge hand in your pocket And you can't do anything to minimize it This is what makes the rich and the poor very different The rich do not work for money, the first cost is taxes You see, there are 3 kinds of income here. Profit, portfolio, passive income So profit is earned income, if I get a job, this is my income If I am a doctor or programmer, that is my income Because i work for it If I buy an apple for $ 10, I sell for $ 20 That's, uh ... Portfolio income, capital gains But passive income, that is, cash flow But never taxed That's why these guys are screaming in the United States now Too many taxes and good luck Because most complainers do n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know There are actually 3 types of income In any case, the rich do not have any jobs They have assets So the average is smaller than the poor guys there You know send kids to school and they won't learn this You see, few people buy me Make $ 1 million but pay zero taxes When my rich dad taught me to play Monopoly That's how it changes, the difference between 4 green houses and a red hotel Or the origin of McDonald's? McDonald's is real estate business They sell hamburgers and then they buy real estate So they don't pay taxes You know this guy Bezos, he has $ 16 billion How much tax did he pay for this $ 16 billion? zero However all this is legal and anyone can do it Most people lack education So you have to learn how to use debt as money You can never say i can't afford it You see, because the bank will give you money So these banks, after the 2008 financial crisis The bank gave me $ 300 million tax free When I asked ordinary people, I said, can you? Why not choose debt? They ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get a loan Because they score This Fico score, they only have those there Just too bad The school teacher will never tell you these Because they don't know My poor dad never knew this You don't know if something is an asset or a liability Until you can say it in cash flow So the house, is it an asset or a liability? If you are taking money from a bag This is a liability If you put money into your pocket, this is the asset The U.S. government wants us to provide housing Provide work, and ask us to borrow money Because this is how to create money through debt Like a huge tax benefit Everyone can do the same thing If they all have financial education to do it If people understand tax policies, we will become more prosperous But can poverty also be genetically inherited? This is because of a certain way of thinking And an attitude It's very simple when people ask me how can I stop all this? I just, never say, I ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford it Ask yourself, what should I do? Why i have so much money Because I never said, I can't do it, I just do it, what should I do? Then I just do it! I made a lot of mistakes But this is how I learn, how can I do it? But the poor, like my poor dad Always say i can't afford Do you think I did it with money? I'm a school teacher, I can't do it! I chose to give up My rich dad never used words like this So whenever I meet the poor I use words like \"I can\\'t\" Many times These people will say, I ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford it, I ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it I can't go to college The rich are evil now I choose not to participate This is one thing people can change today It's a conversation in their head Stop saying the word \"can\\'t\" So, what should I do? Especially when I ca n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford it, how can I afford it? Because it made them start to think of it as an investment For a better future Yes, like when I borrowed $ 300 million I can't do it when I just want to ask When I was rejected many times, I think you know Whenever I show my finances to the bank, they leave Sorry please take a look Do me a favor, why do you reject me he told me This is how the numbers are here So if I fix those numbers Can I see you again? So it's called rejection My wife also rejected me for 6 months It's just about personal will, it's mental ability So i said If they can do it, I can do it too But what should I do? I think this is what you once said Speech becomes a limb Intelligence and experience will increase through your mistakes Up and down Or let you learn something Real estate is real estate But what I learned made me rich, not money He taught me that money is only used to make money You know i think we all Everyone has a trough of life But if they get the information A new life will begin If they do n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the information, they will continue to fall I get richer because I don't need any money I can use them to make money But how did I get there, I made so many mistakes People are afraid to make mistakes Everything is afraid of failure Good, good, very good Many people can feel this sound", "QJnfGBP0qRA": "", "d0yGdNEWdn0": "Translator: Ahmed AbouZaid Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla Those present behind, do you hear me clearly? Well, excellent. Have you ever been preoccupied with a question? For a long time until it becomes part of your thinking? Maybe even part of you as a person? Well, I had a question on my mind for many years How can we accelerate the learning process? It is really an interesting question Because if you can learn faster, It will take less time in school. And if you learn really quickly You may not need to go to school at all. Now, when I was young, the school was ok but ... I often noticed that the school was a barrier to the education process I had this question in my mind: How do we learn faster? And it started when I was very, very young, When I was eleven years old, I wrote a letter to researchers in the Soviet Union, asking them about Hypnopaedia, That is, learning while sleeping, You bring a tape recorder, and place it beside your bed Then you turn it on at night While you sleep, You are supposed to learn from this. Good idea, but unfortunately it does not work! However, learning during sleep opened the doors for researchers in other areas We had a great discovery about The education that started with the first question. From there, I became passionate about psychology And I participated in psychology in many different ways For the rest of my life up to this point. In 1981, she went to China I decided that I would be at the level of Native Chinese speakers within two years Now, you have to understand in 1981, everyone thought The Chinese are really very difficult And that the Western person may study for 10 years or more He is not even close to being good at it. I also thought of a different idea And that was: taking all the conclusions From psychology research until that time And apply them to the learning process Which was really cool, as I became fluent in Mandarin Chinese within 6 months It took a little longer to reach the level of the native speakers But I looked around and saw all of these from different countries Suffering terribly with the Chinese, I saw Chinese people terribly suffering to learn English and other languages, So a question was as follows: How to help ordinary adults To learn a new language quickly, easily, and efficiently? Now this is a really important question in today's world We have enormous challenges with the environment We have enormous challenges with social disintegration, With wars, all the things that happen And if we can't communicate, We will have difficulty solving these problems. So we need to be able to speak each other's languages, This is very, very important. The question then is: How can we do that? Well, it's really easy. Look around and find people who are already doing it, Find cases that actually work with them Then the principles can be defined and applied. It's called modeling, and I'm starting to look at language learning And he has worked as a model for language learning between 15 and 20 years now. My conclusion and my remarks from that Any adult can learn a second language fluently within 6 months. Now when I say that, most people think I'm crazy, and that is not possible. So, let me remind everyone of the history of human progress It is all about expanding our borders. In 1950, everyone thought it was impossible to run a mile in four minutes, And then, Roger Banster did that in 1956 From there it became shorter and shorter. 100 years ago, everyone believed that heavy things could not fly. However, she can and we all know that. How heavy things can fly? We reorganized the materials using principles we learned From observing nature, birds are in this state. And today we went even further ... We went further, so the car could fly. You can buy one of these cars for a few hundred thousand dollars. Now in this world we have cars that can fly. There are different ways of flying that we learned from squirrels, So all you need to do is copy what the flying squirrel does. Create a suit called a wing suit and here you go, you can fly like a squirrel. Now most people, many people, and I will not tell all people But many people think they cannot draw. However there are some basic principles, five principles that you can apply To learn to draw, and can actually learn to draw in five days. So, if you draw this way, you can learn these principles in five days And applying them and after five days you can draw something like this. Now I know this is true because that was my first drawing Five days after applying these principles, that was what I could do. And I looked at this and then reached: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh cool! So that is how I look when I focus intensively My mind is exploding. \" So, anyone can learn to draw in five days In the same way, in the same logic, Anyone can learn a second language in six months. How? There are five principles and seven verbs There may be more but definitely this essential. And before I go into them I just want to talk about two myths, I want to refute two myths. First, you need talent. Let me tell you about Zoe. Zoe came from Australia, to the Netherlands, and she was trying to learn Dutch, She suffered so terribly ... She suffered so much Finally people said: \"You are completely useless,\" You're not talented, give up, you're a waste of time. She was very disappointed. Then I discovered those five principles, I moved to Brazil and applied them And during 6 months she was fluent in Portuguese, Thus, talent does not matter. People also believe that immersion in a new country is a way to learn the language. But look in Hong Kong, look at all these Westerners Who had been there for 10 years, and they didn't speak a single Chinese word. Look at all of these Chinese who live in America, Britain, Australia and Canada They were between 10 and 20 years old and never spoke English. Indulging in itself is of no use. Why? Because the drowned can't learn to swim! When you don't speak a language, you are like a child. And if you put yourself in the middle of the context Where all adults talk about things above your level, you will not learn. So, what are the five principles that need attention? The first: the four words, Attention, meaning, relationship, memory, And the connection between them is very important. Especially when you are talking about learning. Come with me on a trip through a forest. She walks through the woods And you see something like this ... little marks on a tree, Maybe you care, maybe not. You walk another 50 meters and see this ... You have to be careful. After another 50 meters, if you don't show interest, you see this ... And at this point, you will pay attention. And I knew that ... important, It is relevant because it means that, All relevant, i.e. information related to your survival Are the things you will pay attention to So you will remember it. If it is related to your personal goals, Then you will pay attention to it. If relevant, you will be notified. So, the first rule, the first principle for learning a language Focus on your language content. Which leads us to the tools. We master the tools with them and we learn the tools faster When it is relevant to us. So let me share my story. The keyboard is a tool. Writing Chinese in a certain way there are ways for that. This is the tool. I had a colleague several years ago. She was going to night school; Tuesday night, Thursday night, Two hours at a time, practice at home, She spent nine months, not learning how to write Chinese. One night we got in trouble. We have 48 hours to deliver a training manual in Chinese. And I got to work, I can assure you In 48 hours, she was able to learn to write Chinese Because it was related to it, it was meaningful and important, She was using some tool to create value. So the second principle for learning a language is to use that language As a tool for communication from the first day Just as the child does. When I first arrived in China, I didn't speak a single Chinese word, And in my second week, I decided to take the train. I spent eight hours sitting in the food cart I am talking to a guard on the train, For some reason he has shown an interest in me, We spoke all night in Chinese He used to draw pictures and make movements with his hands And facial expressions slowly I understood more and more. But the wonderful thing was, two weeks later, When people were speaking Chinese around me, You understand some of this I did not make any effort to learn that. What happened is that I got sucked that night on the train, Which leads us to the third principle. When you first understand the message, Then you acquire the language without knowing it. And this is really documented now, This is called cognitive input. There is 20 to 30 years of research on this, Stephen Krachen, pioneer in this field, And publish all kinds of different studies And this is just one of them. Purple bars show scores on different language tests. The people in purple are the ones who learned the rules and formal study, People in green are the ones who learned about cognitive inputs. So perception works. Perception is the key Learning a language is not about accumulating a lot of knowledge. In many and many cases it comes to physiological (organic) training. A woman I know from Taeyeon did well in English while at school. I got privilege in all stages, Going through college, I got a concession, I went to the United States She found that she couldn't understand what people were saying. And people started asking her: \"Are you deaf?\" It was! Deaf in English. Because we have filters in our brain that filter The sounds used to Sounds are filtered from languages \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039that we do not know. And if you can't hear it, you can't understand it, If you cannot understand it, you will not learn it. So you should be able to hear these sounds. There are ways to do this, but they are physiological exercises. Speech uses muscles. You have 43 muscles in your face, You have to organize them in a way It enables you to make sounds that others can understand. If you do any new sports for several days, And you know how your body feels? hurt? If your face hurts, you do it the right way. The last principle is the case. Self-membership status. If you are sad, angry, worried, or upset, you will not learn! is over. If you are happy, relaxed, and in an alpha state of mind, and curiously, You will learn really fast, Specifically, you need to be tolerant of unclear. If you are one of the people who need to understand 100 percent Every word they hear, you will feel weary, Because you will always be very upset, because you are not perfect. If you are understanding that you know some people, and you are not familiar with others, Just pay attention to what you already understand. You will be fine, relaxed, and you will learn quickly. So, based on these five principles, what are the seven actions you should do? Number one: listen a lot. I call him dipping the brain. Put yourself in context Where you hear tons, tons and tons of a language It does not matter if you understand it or not. You listen to rhythms, to patterns that repeat, You listen to the things that stand out. (Chinese) Bao Naoseh (Arabic) So, just dip your mind in this. The second verb is to know the meaning first, Even before knowing the words. Try it: \"Well how do you do that? I don\\'t know the words!\" Well, you understand the meaning of these different situations. Human communication is body language in many ways, much of body language. From body language you can understand a lot of communication, Thus, you understand, you are gained through cognitive input. And you can use patterns that you already know. If you speak Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese and go to Vietnam, You will understand 60 percent of what they say to you in the daily conversation, Because Vietnamese is 30 percent Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese. Third verb: start mixing. Perhaps you have never thought about it But if you know 10 verbs, 10 nouns, and 10 adjectives, You can say 1000 different things. Language is a creative process. What do young children do? Well, \"me,\" \"pigeon,\" \"now.\" Well, this is how they communicate. So start mixing, create, and have fun with it, You don't have to be perfect, the important thing is that it works. And when you do that, you focus on the crux of the matter. what does that mean? Well, any language is a highly repetitive content. In English 1000 words cover 85 percent From anything you will say in daily communication. 3000 words give you 98 percent From anything you will say in the daily conversation. If you get 3000 words, you speak the language. The rest are additional improvements. And when you start with a new language, Start with your toolbox. Week number one, In your new language, you say things like: \"How do you say that?\" \"I do not understand\" What do you mean by that? In all of your target languages You use it as a tool, make it useful to you, It is relevant to learn other things about language. By the second week, you should say things like: \"I\", \"this\", \"you\", \"that\", \"give\", \"you know\", \"hot\" Simple pronouns, simple nouns, simple verbs, Simple qualities, communicating like a small child. By the third or fourth week, you start with \"pasting words\". Despite, but, and thus, these are the strapping tools That links language, and allows you to make more complex meanings. At that point you are speaking. And when you do that, you have to get a language father. If you look at how children and parents interact, You will understand what this means. When a child talks, he uses simple words, simple structures. Sometimes it looks very strange, sometimes with strange pronunciation, Other people outside the family do not understand it. But the parents understand. Thus the child has a safe environment, and he obtains confidence. Parents talk to the child using body language And with simple language, they know that the child understands. So you have a safe cognitive input environment, We know this will work; otherwise, none of you will speak his native language. So I get a language father, He is a person who takes care of you personally Who will contact you mainly naturally, But he is interested in helping you understand the message. There are four rules for a parent of a language. The couple is not good at this! OK? But the four rules are, First of them, they will work hard to understand what you mean Even if you were wrong. Second, they will not correct your mistakes. Third, they will tell you what they understand what you say So that you can respond appropriately and understand their notes Then they will use words you know. The sixth thing you have to do is copy the face. You have to make the muscles work properly, So you can make sounds in a way that people can understand you. There are a few things you can do. One is to hear the feeling, to feel the sound Which means that you have a cycle of reactions happening in your face, But ideally if you can look at the speaker in his native language And notice how they use their faces, Let your unconscious mind understand the rules, Then, then, you will be able to use it. And if you can't look at a native speaker, you can use things like ... (Female voice) Singing, song, king, stubborn, suspended. (Chris Lonsdale) And the last idea here, the last act you need to do Something I call \"direct contact\". What does this mean? Well, most people learn a second language Somehow they take the words of their mother tongue and the new language and move between them Time and time again in their minds to try and remember these words. This is completely ineffective. What you need to do is realize that Everything you know is a picture in your mind, it is feelings, If you talk about fire, you can smell smoke, You can hear the crackling, you can see the flame, So what you do, is you go inside these visualizations and all that memory And you exit another path. So I call it \"the same box, with a different path.\" You exit this path and build it over time, Become more skilled at connecting new sounds With these pictures that you already have, in your inner mind. As time passes you become better naturally in this process, Where he spoke unconsciously. So, there are five principles you need to work on, and seven verbs, If you do any of them, you will get better. And remember that these things are in your hands as a learner. Do them all, and you will be fluent in the second language within six months. thank you (clap)", "S7NKxadiZxo": "Today my name is Jenny Darren. Nice to meet you Jenny.

You know why cuz you We're just like a couple the tops running across the meadow You make me feel so young Make me songs to the Sun Kieran Make me feel so young feels so", "sFlQC8_uPMg": "", "akcc6DphLIg": "So, uh, what's your name and what affiliate are you here with? Chris Spealler of CrossFit Park City. What's your inspiration for being here today? Um. Just enjoy using my body. Enjoy fitness and the gifts and abilities given. In 2007, I think it wasn't necessarily an event it was just like the atmosphere. Yeah, Spealler! Go! Go! Go! Yeah! I think it was the BBQ at the end of day one that was probably the most memorable. Anything you could say to anybody to motivate them to come next year? Um. It's just fun. Great sense of community. Fun people. And, uh, good times. Yeah. KHALIPA: At that point it was, it was a, just a totally different time in the sport. That was on a ranch with ... you know, you got to pick what workout you wanted to do at what time of day. It was totally different. I remember it like it's yesterday. And then boom it came to me and I had to go because Spealler was already on you know number nine out of 30. And you just hear the announcers, \"Oh Josh Everett is on this number ... this person\\'s on this number ...\" and I was thinking to myself, OK, I caught up! I caught up! And I just kept going. And going, and going. And then boom. I won. I remember after I won the event I went to In-N-Out Burger and I was just sitting there I won $1,800 bucks. I was just sitting at In-N-Out Burger like, OK, I had some gas money and some change for sure. THORISDOTTIR: The first thing that comes to mind when I think about the Games 2009 is muscle-ups. The support and help that I got to try to get a muscle-up was ridiculous. Even from girls that were fighting for the spot on the podium. They were still trying to give me some tips. I think it was at that moment that I actually kind of fell in love with CrossFit. FRONING: I hate losing. And I, I have said a few times I don't know if I like winning more than I hate losing um but I absolutely despise losing. In anything. It seems like when I have struggles they're epic struggles. Going into the final event in, in the lead um, by complete surprise COMMENTER: He's in trouble. He has tried that three or four times. FRONING: Going to jump up on a rope. Didn't think that would be a problem. And, uh, get about halfway up and realizing it's not going to happen. COMMENTER: Oh, look at Rich Froning. He decides that ... Oh! He just rallied the forces rallied the body to climb that damned rope without using any legs. LEBLANC-BAZINET: In 2011 final workout of the Games I'm like I really want to like get into that top 5. I just really wanted it. And, uh, started the workout and my rower is not working. COMMENTER: Oh man. There's something wrong with her rower. Oh that's going to hurt. It was surreal and it was like so hurtful at this point because it's everything you put in and it's not something you can control. So it's really like just something else outside that you have no control over it and you're like ... it really crushed me. It just so much preparation for that. So much hard work and to have something like that happen that is completely out of your control. FOUCHER: I think that one of my absolute favorite events was Camp Pendleton. Um. Just because of the camaraderie out there. I remember several times during that workout like, having other people help me keep going. Um. Like, one of the strongest memories I have that I'll always take with me is doing most of that run with Christy Phillips (Adkins). And her coming up behind me with a pack of people And being like, OK guys, we're going to run for 30 seconds. Ready, go! And they would all run, and they kind of picked me up along the way. It was just ... it was so awesome. I don't think I would have done that without someone next to me the whole time. BRIGGS: One of the ultimate goals of being a CrossFitter is to make it to the Games. And then to have made it three times. And then to have actually won it. Is the ultimate prize. All of a sudden it was over. The weekend was over and then I stood on the podium with everybody screaming with the Union Jack. It's like, did it really happen? Did I dream that? Sometimes sometimes I don't believe it, but then but no it did, it happened. COMMENTER: Samantha Briggs is the Fittest Woman on Earth. BRIGGS: So my aim now is to get back there next year. And hopefully make it back onto the podium. Whether that's in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. I would just like to be back on the podium. CASTRO: You can't have any flaws if you want to be at that top level in CrossFit. If you want to be one of the best in the world if you want to compete with Rich Froning you have to be solid everywhere. MCKERNAN: It's no longer for funsies. It's no longer a recreational, something I do on the side. It's no longer three on one off. It's all day every day 24 hours a day. Every decision they make. WOODLAND: It's a full time job to train and get in to the CrossFit Games. And Rich Froning is a big reason for that because the only way you'll catch him is if you dedicate your life to that sole purpose. Being the best at anything there's a lot of sacrifice and I'm not going to go compete and compete for 10th or 11th or 30th. That's not fun for me. So if I can't go at 100% and try to win the Games every year then, what's the point? If I have to travel, if I have to you know, spend spend time doing something that I need to do or you know, I would want to do family wise and stuff like that I can't completely enjoy it. You know, it's just time for me to spend some time on those things that I have been neglecting. for the past few years. And actually enjoy them. It's not to say that I don't enjoy doing those things. But there's just always that ... in my head is what should I be doing? We're going at 28 and I don't quite know what we're doing. It's either going to be thruster, squat clean deadlift, or a combination of all three. SHERWOOD: Jason Khalipa guy is cut from a different cloth. He's a unique individual on, on, on many levels. I ate a lot at night. Too much at night. Last night, dude, I hit this Whole Foods popcorn. Fuck. It had chocolate on it. I could not stop. I could not stop. I feel like a crack addict. I was just sitting there ... You meet him at first and you want to just think that he's some Saint Bernard that you've given too much sugar to. KHALIPA: You have to remember that when I got into this there was no money, no fame. No competition, really. And so I got into it because I just want to train, throwdown with my buddies. And now everybody wants to train to get to the CrossFit Games. But the reality of the situation is very few people make it there. So they need to take a step back and be like, why am I doing this? And the answer should be they're doing it for themselves. They're doing it because they want to be in better shape than 99% of the population. And they want to have a good time doing it. And if they're not having a good time, they're in their dungeon by themselves with headphones on just hating life every day they're not going to get very far in CrossFit. They might get to the Games one year but I guarantee they won't be there consistently. Because it just takes a toll on your body. Gotta enjoy the experience. This is a whole ride. And uh you gotta relish in it and enjoy it. It's hard because I think I think that every year I'm pushing it's just that in my head I'm like it keeps getting more mature every year so I just feel like every year I'm pushing more. You know? But this year, yeah. You can ask Dave. I'm kind of a mental case here. CAMERAMAN: What? Nothing is given everything is earned, Ian. Good, better, best never let it rest. Til your good is better and your better is your best. CAMERAMAN: Is that true? I have no idea what he just said. Hashtag Dave Lipson. Just because I won the Games last year doesn't mean that I can win it again this year. People are coming back stronger, faster. There's new people coming into the sport who are 10 years younger than me who are already a hell of a lot stronger and faster than me. So I need to evolve as an athlete this is something that I can incorporate into my training which is helping with my strength. But it's not hindering uh, my gymnastics or my uh, running or anything like that. I have no butt cheeks. I need to evolve as an athlete. Whether I'm evolving in the right way ... or not. We'll only find out when the Games is here. One week before the 2014 Open. If you put heavy weight on your back and you go up and down with it, you're going to get stronger. It doesn't really matter how much weight that is. Uh. Or how many set or how many reps you do. Just gotta move the bar. You know what I'm saying? Grooving.  Grooving. Just grooving, bro. Here's the reality. The reality of the situation is, is that you get what you put in in life and hard work you know generally leads towards success. And I'm working hard on everything I have going in my life. Whether it be in the gym in the business or for my family everyday all day I'm sitting there asking myself the question, what can I do better as a X? As a father, as a husband ... as a, as a business owner as a, as a, you know as an athlete. And uh every day I'm striving to get better, and better, and better at that. And I think when it comes to the time where you know lots of things are slipping that's when I have to re-assess. Right now things are going good. Uh. I'm dedicated. I'm dedicated to winning the CrossFit Games. I'm dedicated to I'm dedicated to being a good father, a good businessman. And whenever that time comes something has got to give. And it surely can't be the business because that supports our life. And it surely can't be my family. So. There's only one more thing left. But hopefully that day won't come. I could always keep a good balance. And balance in life is really important. Balance and hard work. You know, a lot of people they think CrossFit Games athletes only workout for a living truth of the matter is very few CrossFit Games athletes make a full-time living just off the CrossFit Games. You know. Myself, for example, I have a full-time job. I'm running a, you know, a big company that employs 40 people. There's a lot of other CrossFit Games athletes that have to work. Garret goes to school. And uh you know It's just not the truth. People sit there like, Oh I could do that if I had all day to train. The reality of the situation is, a lot of these guys don't. They're trying to run gyms. They're trying to support their families, support themselves. And so I think people have the wrong impression about CrossFit Games athletes. Very few make a full-time living. Very, very few. Off the Games. A lot of them made a lot of sacrifices in their life. And I think people need to respect that. Anybody that makes it to the CrossFit Games has made a lot of sacrifices in their life. When everybody else is sitting there on the couch playing video games or when everybody else is doing X, Y, Z, the Games athletes those guys are training. Those guys are pushing to get better at something. And uh I'm just honored to be a part of that group. when we all get to the Games, right. Because it just shows, you know if you're sitting on the bus with some dude that dude worked his ass off to get there. It didn't just happen. Or it didn't just happen because he didn't have a day job. It happened because he put in a lot of work to get there. Feel me? You know what I'm saying? CAMERAMAN: What's happening? I'm going to get drugs tested. Nice. So I have to take it with me. That's your pee? It's the new flavor. It's the new flavor? It's the new flavor Progenex. Briggs. Briggs (laughs). SHERWOOD: Ok, let's say, I'm not a steroid expert but let's say it allows you to put on muscle easier, um maybe lets you recover faster so you can workout harder more often but it doesn't freaking increase your pain tolerance which the critical part of doing well in CrossFit is your ability to just suffer. FRONING: Yeah. You can take all the steroids you want. If you don't have it between the ears you know, that's a wonderful deadlift you have and by the way you're 60th at regionals. FRONING: That's like, there are several people that I'm sure are fitter than I am physically but mental, when you get to that point it's like there's a tradeoff there. It's part of the ... you know it's not one of the 10 General Physical Skills mental toughness but it should be. LEBLANC-BAZINET: I think that's one of the reasons why you see the same girls over and over again going to the Games is that, like, if you want to beat me or in my region me and Michele you don't just have to be like good and manage all the skills the weight and all that you need to be like willing to die. Like, you need to leave it all there cause like we're going to do it. You know? We're like we've done it she did it for three times I did it four times but like like, we're going to go in that really dark place and if we need to go there in every single workout to secure a spot to the Games we'll do it. So it's like, not only you need to be I guess as good as we are now you need to be willing to go there with us. WOODLAND: The way to explain the Open to people is that it's the first step on a three step process to find the fittest on Earth. MCKERNAN: So far in the Open historically all we've seen is one-on-one match ups. Tonight five champions three men two women one funky heat. The first time that we paired male and female athletes in head-to-head competition in that type of scenario. Right ... I can't tell ... Are you messing No, I agree with you. My booty shorts booty shorts are ready. BRIGGS: They're always scary because you don't know what Dave's going to throw at you. So you stand there and people always say, Oh you knew in advance. You really don't. We do a general warm up. We stand there. And as he announces it we go out and do it. CASTRO: The clock, save you it will not. You will do 168 reps or you will quit in the process of trying. 14.5 is for time. BRIGGS: And then 3, 2, 1, go! You give it everything you've got. CASTRO: 3, 2, 1, go! COMMENTER: 14.5 underway for the champ-packed Kezar Pavillion. Five champions: Graham Holmberg Annie Thorisdottir Rich Froning Samantha Briggs and Jason Khalipa. MCKERNAN: But as soon as they drop the flag you hear Sean Woodland says it in his call it looks like Sam Briggs got shot out of a cannon. FRONING: Sam goes out like a bat out of hell. Didn't even think about it. I was like, well she's going to kill us on this workout not even worth it you know, just let her go. BRIGGS: Nobody had really seen anything of Annie. We didn't know how she was going to uh, perform. So I wanted to try and get out ahead. It could have blown up in my face. COMMENTER: Sam Briggs now onto the 15 thrusters. Rich Froning still in second. Jason Khalipa slight lead over Graham Holmberg for third and then it's Annie Thorisdottir in fifth place right now. BRIGGS: When you're in so much pain and your lungs are ready to burst you kind of, uh, ... does it matter if I beat Rich? No. COMMENTER: The two defending champions nearly rep-for-rep here on that set of 9. FRONING: So once I started to get a little closer, I was like alright now I'm going to try to beat Sam. COMMENTER: Rich Froning has been steady throughout. Three more bar-facing burpees for him and he will be done. Briggs is on the barbell. She will beat Annie Thorisdottir handily in this workout. But it's Rich Froning who else? The champ, another victory. Unbelievable. FLOOR ANNOUNCER: And when you saw Rich Froning creep on that lead what was going through your head? BRIGGS: I'll let him. Sam Briggs almost took down the champ in head-to-head competition with Rich Froning. She was absolutely incredible. The Open in the past two years gave us our CrossFit Games champion. Last year Rich won the Open he won the Games. The year before Rich won the Open he won the Games. Last year Sam won the Open she won the Games. WOODLAND: Rich Froning the overall leader he wins the Open again. Eighteen total points for him. Sam Briggs sits atop the overall leaderboard at the end of the 2014 Open. It's her second straight Open championship. She beats Camille Leblanc-Bazinet who finishes second for the second straight year. Last year Briggs beat Bazinet by 27 points. This year she beats her by 127 points. LEBLANC-BAZINET: It's cool to be second just for the fact that it's great to know that you're still in the race. You know? But at the same time I stay very realistic that I know that there's a lot of work that needs to be done. BRIGGS: There are going to be 50 of us there. And any one of those can take it. Not just Annie, not just Julie, not just me. It's all about who who is ... made their weaknesses their strength. Who can go out there and make every single workout in their wheelhouse. My name is Lindsey Valenzuela. I'm 27 years old. I live in Moorpark, California. And I've been to the CrossFit Games three years. It was probably the coolest moment of my life being up there on the podium. And proving to myself and to others but mostly to myself that I could get there and that I belong near the top. I knew last year going into regionals I wanted to win. Um. This regionals I want to win even more. I want to prove to myself that it wasn't a fluke. And I can win more than just one year. You know, the conversation all year long was about three women in particular. And it was about Annie Thorisdottir, Julie Foucher, and Sam Briggs. And those were the three women that everybody was excited about. I mean, we were basically betting on the fact that that would be the podium in one format or another. She wants to be a doctor. And she wants to be the Fittest Woman on Earth. FOUCHER: Yes, I've pretty much given myself this year and next year and then after that I have to be in school and training ... like training for being a doctor full-time. To marry those two things together is one of the craziest goals I've ever heard. When you take into account what other people are doing for, uh, for a living or for their jobs. Um, I'll have to start doing my clinicals um where it's just ... I mean even now it's not really possible to keep up that kind of schedule and still stay competitive in CrossFit. Just because you have to make it almost like your full-time job if you want to stay at that level. So so yeah, I'm pretty much giving myself two years. And then I remember that the other shocking thing is Annie Thorisdottir was way in the back. She really wasn't even a contender in that event. And that, that raised some red flags. That maybe she wasn't all the way back. And maybe she was still nursing that injury. THORISDOTTIR: I obviously do not like losing and I really lost. I didn't even beat the guys! Um, it was ... Yeah, I don't like losing I know I need to work on something. And I'm going to be ready. I'll be ready. I'm pretty ... I'm pretty fired up right now to just train hard. MARQUEZ: She won back-to-back titles and it kind of seemed like she was just on this, like, path. Going up to where nothing was going to stop her. And then a pretty serious injury knocked her off the rails. I just PRed by back squat. I'm super excited. And I decided I didn't need to rest and I didn't need to warm-up my deadlift or anything like that because my squat warmed up my deadlift. Threw my technique out the window and I just tore up the bar. And I could feel just from that very first pull I felt something move in my back. My doctor said I would never be 100% again. But the fact was I didn't want to get 100% again. I want to get better than I was before. I wanted to get 150%. What are your self doubts? That I'm not good enough. That other girls are better. Um. But I think that every competitor goes through that and if they say they don't they're lying. How hard is it to keep training on days when you just don't feel your best? Um. Hard. It's more mentally hard than physically hard. I think this happens, and I've seen this happen to almost every other CrossFit Games athlete. Is there comes a point where you have to just stop and ask yourself why you're doing this. Especially as it becomes so much more demanding. And all along the way, um, I guess, you know, you just keep going because you can. And then eventually you have to stop and ask yourself why am I doing this and why do I want to keep going? But you just do it because you don't have a choice. So you don't have a choice? Yeah, can't not do it. And I just hit that point where I was like I don't know if I want to do this anymore. Like, I don't know if it's worth it because I'm just ... I was sort of at my last straw. If your CrossFit career ended now, would you be happy? Yeah. Knock on wood. I think that I've shown people I'm a good athlete. But most importantly I showed people what it means to never give up. And I've led by a good example. I've always said if I can leave this sport being a good example rather than being a good athlete I'd be happy. Winning is cool and awesome and satisfying, but if I was winning and people didn't respect me I wouldn't be happy. So for me there's a lot of a lot of reasons why I'm training to be the fittest on Earth. And why I want to be the fittest on Earth. I think for one I've seen myself progress over the years. And I see how I am capable. And I know that I am capable of being the fittest on Earth. And I think that and why I am kind of giving myself this year and next year to pursue that goal is because I want to see if it's possible. And I don't, I don't ever want to have any regrets. Can you delete that? SHERWOOD: Who do you think are going to be the three people going from SoCal this year? Why? Why ask these questions? I hate these questions. I don't even want to answer it. SHERWOOD: Age? 30. Height? 5-5 on a tall day. Sometimes I can be a mix between a Camille and a lion. So I am a Camillion. Roar. Right now I'm getting my shins warmed up. Looks really weird. Your shins warmed up? Yeah. So just like stretching out my shins. Do you ever just walk around like that, like in the street? No. Slow down! Jesus! I am a cookie monster. Chocolate chip cookies and milk at night almost every night. Almost every night. I saw those The cookie jar. Yes. There's a cookie ... there's a cookie jar in my house, yes. And if it's empty it will get refilled soon. SHERWOOD: Would you commit a crime if you knew you could get away with it? No. What's the fastest you've ever driven in a car? Uh, 105 miles per hour. That's a crime. Yes, ma'am. I don't know what's wrong. Point the camera lower. Jesus christ. So this is a pretty serious session here. Tensions are high. She's already ready to go and I'm like resting still. They're still red and sore. I only just had the operation. Might want to get some sort of a cream on there. I mean my brother and Jason do a lot more than what I usually do. So, do you have 'What is Garret Doing?' on your ... No, I do not have what is Garret doing. I am better than Garret. We shouldn't say that ... don't say that on camera. No, he'll get mad. He will. Since Jason Khalipa has put up that little stupid \\'What is Rich Doing?\" thing. It's like that's not a good motivator. Like, I don't think about what Rich is doing. And like whatever Rich is doing is fine, that's what motivates Rich. And that's what gets Rich to where he is and that's awesome. And I think what Rich has done is phenomenal. I'll never take that away from Rich. but for me if I focus on what Rich is doing like, it doesn't allow me to be the best that I am. You know it doesn't ... it allows me to I don't want to say that I use, like, let me try to rephrase this correctly I guess um I guess the best way I can put it are you a golfer? At all? Ok. Do you follow golf at all? No? I'm guessing probably not then. So, obviously Tiger Woods was there for a while. He was the ... he was kind of like the Rich Froning of golf. He is, like, the guy who is basically beating everyone  and everyone was kind of going for second. To Tiger Woods. And then there were a couple of guys behind him. And this was back in 04, 05, probably 06 when Tiger was at his like peak. And uh there were two guys, Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els, and Phil Mickelson or and Ernie Els, is like I wake up every morning and I want to know what Tiger's doing. I think about him. What is Tiger doing today? How can I be making myself more like him? To get to, you know, where he's at. And Phil Mickelson kind of laughed at it when he said that. He's like ... he's like that's pretty terrible. He's like I wake up and I enjoy my morning with my kids and have coffee. He's like ... and so that has always, like, really resonated with me as to where I can't have those external focus on a guy like Rich. To see what Rich is doing. Because if I consume myself with what Rich is doing I'm always going to think I'm not doing enough. And so and the moral of the story was Phil Mickelson went on to beat Tiger Woods at a couple ... he beat him in the masters he beat him in the championship. And Ernie Els fell off the face of the Earth. Like, no kidding, like after that year like three years later you never heard of Ernie Els again. Like, he has done nothing since then. And so that has been the biggest eye opener for me. So whenever Jason made that \"What is Rich Froning Doing?\" I just chuckled at it. I'm like, perfect. I'm like, Rich owns you now. Like, you are only striving to be as good as Rich. You'll never be better than him. You know, the nights where it's like I mean let's say on a Friday I put in a triple session Friday night rolls around. It's like, well, I can't stay out until midnight. I can't stay out until 1. I can't do those things. You got to sleep because you're going to get up on Saturday and at 10 o'clock you're going to go out and workout again. And you're going to go and get the rest and and you just have to make the sacrifice. Oh yeah, people ask me all the time what's my secret. Especially for like pull-ups or, uh, you know those movements that are more my, uh, my trademark or my strength. And I have all those drills. And I give them those drills, and the truth is I'm not scared of anyone beating me because I know that most of them are not willing to put in the work that I put in. So. I tell them, do 10 million of them and do all the drills that I gave you every day and next thing you know no one does it. So. Like, I give them my magic pill. They're just not willing to put the same work in. So. That's where, uh, ... And then you'll get that new girl who's willing to put the work in. She'll be there. She'll be there. So. I think that's the magic pill. (Inaudible) on the podium comes and goes so fast. And like if that's what you're doing it for those external motives like with like we've been talking about all day you're not going to get there. That's not motive enough. Like if you aren't enjoying what you're doing day in and day out to get you there. The journey there. You know, you might as well quit. Because that's 99% of it. You know? The standing on the podium or getting to the Games is the 1%. You know? It's just it's such a short period of time. It's a flash and it's gone. Yeah you get a few memories out of it. But gosh, the other memories are the hours that you spent in the gym with whoever you're training with. Or your coach, or by yourself with you and just the barbell. It's like if you're not enjoying that, man, you're probably not going to get ... Yeah, it's a lot of work for very little reward. And so I think that's the secret. It's enjoy what you're doing. I actually talked about this with people at my work. You know they're like, Dan, you look super tired. You don't look like the 6th fittest man in the world. And my response was I'm not doing this just for fitness. I'm not, I'm not the case where it's like hey I just want to get in good shape. I'm competing in a professional sport to win. Sometimes it's just miserable. Especially those days where you're tired or you get emotional. I think it's like there are those days where your demons your inside demons come out. And, uh, you have no support, you have nothing to like no one to make you feel good about yourself or whatever those are kind of the days where you need to, like, I guess get better mentally. Or just kick that little demon off and keep going. So those days are very miserable but I think those are some of the best training sessions you can have. So. It's like, same if someday you feel like on paper you did suck like sometimes that's the best day and that's the best training you could have. If you had a dog what would you name your dog? I really like Baxter. Baxter? Yeah. Like from Anchorman? Yeah. Three, two, ... we're going that way There are only three spots per region to get to the Games. There are now so many other athletes coming up who are good who are focusing wholly on the regionals to qualify for the Games. So you can't take anything for granted. You need to make sure that you are in top shape. Top form. For Regionals. As any slip up will mean that your trip to Carson is cancelled this year. And I for one do not want that to happen. What's today? Today is Friday. Today is the first day of regionals. For breakfast after the competition. I did have some for dessert last night. If you're going to mess up anywhere it's going to be on the snatch and then you only get like one attempt at the handstand walk. So. They're the biggest they have the biggest risk factor associated with them. CrossFit problems. CrossFit problems. #CrossFitProblems COMMENTATOR: Hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back to CrossFit HQ's coverage of the 2014 Reebok CrossFit Games European Regional. There's an old saying, are you hurt or are you injured? And we're about to find out which one it is. I didn't see Annie do one repetition in her warm-up, so it'll be interesting to see what she can pull off here. And she was legitimately ... I could see in Annie Thorisdottir's eyes that she was legitimately afraid before she took the floor for the snatch event. That she wasn't going to be able to hit anything. Sam Briggs misses 145. Annie Thorisdottir, successful lift at 150. And there's that smile that we've come to know from Annie Thorisdottir. Sam Briggs for 1-6-5. And a good lift for Sam Briggs. Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir is actually leading the pack. She's now at 70 feet. 80 feet. BRIGGS: I was hoping to get one full length. That was my aim. When I came down I looked I was like, ah that's not too bad! But then when I saw the placing then I was like, ah, OK. COMMENTATOR: And there's Sam Briggs who is out of the handstand walk early on. Not a good thing for Sam Briggs. BRIGGS: Suddenly more stressful than I planned. Yeah, fine. Handstand walk was a little bit shit, but I ... yeah ... I just ... I ... didn't warm the handstand up, purposely because I didn't want to mess with the snatch. The defending champ meanwhile currently sits in 9th place after three events. For some people that would be cause for concern. You say no worries whatsoever. I am not worried about Sam Briggs qualifying again at all. It was kind of a big shock. Everyone is staring at the leaderboard like oh man how is she going to bounce back from that? But secretly in the back of your mind thinking she's going to come back. She's the champ. She's going to come back. I have to win the rest. There is no second place. I have to win the rest. Sam Briggs across the line in 10 minutes 17 seconds unofficially. Tanja Davidsdottir in the all white chasing just behind her. Sam Briggs showing no fear maintaining the lead. Annie Thorisdottir close behind, and if you're a CrossFit Games fan this is what you came for. At under 4 minutes Sam Briggs is getting the crowd into it as she advances her chess piece and gets into her 10th and final round. She is going to annihilate the event record. Sam Briggs is an absolute cyborg. 10th and final rope climb for Sam Briggs! And the crowd here at the Ballerup Arena has erupted as Sam Briggs says you can't get rid of me that easily. Unofficially 4 minutes and 30 seconds. Davidsdottir is having a complete meltdown in lane number 7. Right now it probably feels like her world is coming apart. The final heat of women literally comes down to this last event. Currently Sam's in 4th 2 points behind 3rd and 4 points behind 2nd. You never heard that expression? Dogs were in the poo. The shit. So I'm shaking like a shitting dog. Only one workout left. And I need to not fuck up. In my heart of hearts Sam Briggs is doing to pull off the impossible. Not a Sam Briggs workout. I'm going to try and think I am Talayna Fortunato. Anybody got some socks that I can stuff my bra with? Yeah, I feel like I'm getting fitter because my heart rate is staying elevated the entire weekend. COMMENTATOR: It's all about Sam Briggs. Who is threatening to accomplish the impossible. Just two points out of the podium. The current event record under 2 minutes. 1 minute and 55 by Pip Malone. Sam Briggs needs to not just do well here she needs to do very well and she needs some help. Coming off the bar there were already three people doing overhead squats so I had no choice but to go straight into it. COMMENTATOR: Sam Briggs puts the bar down. In lane number 4. And Briggs is struggling so on the 5th rep she puts the bar down. And at that point the air pretty much came out of the room. Everybody realized it was reality. And she wasn't going to go to the CrossFit Games. As soon as I dropped the bar the realization set in that I wasn't going to the Games. And that for me was probably one of the hardest moments of my CrossFit career. Having to pick up that bar and finish the reps knowing that it didn't make any difference. That I wasn't going to the Games. That bar felt more like 400 pounds. Not 135. Ah, I was a little bit upset obviously. Uh, messing up twice on the overhead squats. But I was aiming for a 2:30 that would have still put me in 7th against those little beasts. So, it wouldn't have affected the scoreboard at all. 4th coming back from 26th not a bad effort for the weekend. And the fact of the matter is that in any given workout in any given region you show a weakness and, and you rest on nothing. You can't rest on your laurels. She was out of the CrossFit Games for essentially one mistake. Hello everyone, Sean Woodland and Pat Sherwood recapping the third and final day of competition at the Southern California region and probably the biggest story of the weekend coming out of this region on the women's side of things Lindsey Valenzuela winds up in 4th place. She will not be going back to the CrossFit Games. Valerie Voboril finishing first Becca Voigt, and then Games rookie Lauren Fisher the first time she is going to Carson, California. But for the second straight week we have a woman who stood on the podium at the 2013 Reebok CrossFit Games who is not going back. VALENZUELA: I think a champion has to go through a little bit of a hard time and I think God has a plan for me. And, uh, I might not know what it is right now and I might not know what it is next week but I'll figure it out. MCKERNAN: She didn't have a finish worse than 8th place. The entire weekend! All top 10 finishes! And that used to be the statistic you would read off when you said here's what makes a CrossFit Games champion. Everything inside the top 8? Oh yeah you're good to go. Because that's consistency across the board. But the fact of the matter is that the tide has risen so high that anything, any slip up and you're losing that space. VALENZUELA: That moment of like oh shit I'm not going to the Games and uh feeling like I let my fans down. Um. Feeling like I let my coach down. My husband down. And my family down. It was shitty. I'm sorry, Dusty. It's OK. You know it's ... we don't go out there and just put on a performance. It's not just a performance. It is a year of our life accumulating into one weekend to make it to the CrossFit Games. BRIGGS: I was feeling great. I was feeling stronger and fitter than I did the year before. And I wasn't going to be given the chance to prove it. I went and enjoyed some drinks with my friends and the next morning I tried to shake the hangover off. And went straight back into training. VALENZUELA: I've learned both sides. That I want it even more now but it's OK to lose. Because losing, it doesn't define me. I can still be who I am, and still inspire people. My Games journey for that year was over so it was time to reassess and get ready for the Games next year. SHERWOOD: She's such an incredible, ridiculous human being athlete and she wasn't good enough to go. Should she have gotten an invite? No, she shouldn't have. LeBron James will miss a three pointer with two seconds left and their whole season will be over and they lost the championships. And he was the MVP of the season, he's the greatest basketball player in the world and he misses a three point shot with one second left. That was Sam Briggs' three point shot with one second left. She had a couple opportunities. And, um, that's the reality. At the end of the day it's still a sport. There's still rules. There's still parameters. There's still a scorecard. There's still points you have to valuable points you have to get at every stage. And she didn't grab those valuable points there climbed back, had a chance at the end and missed it. You have to work so hard for this. What do you mean? I just mean that you have to work so hard for this. Like you have to push so hard every day. Just like really try to achieve that goal. To make it to the Games? Or just to like just to be the best? Or what do you mean? Just to be the best you can be. Just, uh, you have to be really have to be relentless with yourself. There's no stopping. And it's never good enough. When you're at the red line that's when you start kind of doubting yourself. Like, am I going to be able to do this? Can I maintain this? What are the other girls doing? You know, any negative talk. That's when I come back to you're OK you can do this like, you're fine. You're doing it for you. Not for anyone else. Come here, Jake. Last year at the CrossFit Games I did not have fun. Until Sunday. I was miserable. I ... it was ... I don't know. You know, just the fight of it. I did actually enjoy having to battle back. But I just didn't enjoy it. It was just one of those things that I was kind of like I really honestly thought that last year was going to be my last one and I was going to walk away. And, uh, you know I kind of told Hilary that was going to be my last one. We were joking around and there was one afternoon she called me. She was like, what are you doing? I'm at the track. She's like, why are you at the track you hate running? I was like, ah. I need to get better at it. She was like, why do you need to get better at it? You're not done are you? I'm like, nah I'm going to do one more. So. Might as well do one more. I'm not good at anything else, so. Pretty good at working out. WOODLAND: Everyone has either been told, you know, you're too short, you're too tall, you're too big, you're too small you're not strong enough everyone has felt like that at some point in their lives. And when you look at Chris Spealler out there on the floor he shouldn't be there. After six consecutive Games appearances Chris Spealler failed to qualify by one spot in 2013. MARQUEZ: Him not qualifying in 2013 felt like it just wasn't finished yet. It left a bad taste in your mouth and it just didn't seem right. MCKERNAN: Spealler has always been that guy that call him an underdog, call him the David to the Goliath of the CrossFit Games but he's the guy that pulls off the absolute impossible. COMMENTATOR: Chris Spealler goes unbroken on 64 pull-ups look at Chris Spealler! Gray shorts, black knee sleeves, no shirt. This is going to be his 7th trip to the Games! Chris Spealler steps on the finish mat at 1 minute 57 seconds. Securing his trip to go to Carson, California. CASTRO: We were at the first Games together. And eight years later we're going to be at the Games together again. And we've watched eachother grow. He has watched the sport grow. I've watched him grow. As an athlete as a human as a friend. How sweet is it to be going back to the Games? I mean, you're one of the few men who could say you've been this many times. Uh, it's special. Yeah. This is going to be the for real last hurrah. So it was a it feels really good to make it. Who do you think is going to win the CrossFit Games? Uh, you. Ah, I like that. Good job, buddy. Thank you. And just in conversation with Ben and with Sarah it's ... yeah this is it. This needs to be it. And um For various reasons, you know? It's everything from taking care of my body to um it's no longer a sport for somebody 35 5\\' 5\" 150 lb. on a good day. Um. And uh it's I don't want to miss the next two to three years of my kids being out of school in efforts to make it just one or two more times. And be broken when I'm 45. It's just not it's not worth it anymore. He's chasing Graham Holmberg with a time of 1:42. With only 1 rep left he can definitely accomplish that. There it is, can he get it? 1:39 unofficial for Mathew Fraser! With a great chance at a podium spot in Carson, California. To be consistent. Just even keel across everything. I came in last year strong as hell but not an ounce of cardio also. I made sure to correct that. I was 2003, 2005, 2007 school-age national champion. 2009 junior national champion. 2009 junior world team member. I was a resident athlete at the Olympic training center for two years. Resident athlete at the Olympic education center for two years. And then I started CrossFit. Yeah, so, when I first came home it was nice. I was back in Vermont so there's lots of Ben and Jerry's around. And when I first got home it was a pint of Ben and Jerry's every day. And after a couple months of that it started catching up with me. And so I was like, OK I either give up Ben and Jerry's or start working out again. And I didn't want to give up my Ben and Jerry's. Is it too dangerous of a sport? No. No, it's not too dangerous of a sport. I think people need to realize that now CrossFit as a sport is very, very different from CrossFit as a training methodology. There's been a split. There's ... whether people say it or not or admit it um, I still believe that our needs don't vary by kind but they vary by degree. I think that's a very accurate statement. Um, but there has been a split where now the demands on athletes going to the Games and even to regionals at the top tier, athletes in the top 10 or so, um, there is a very different demand on those guys and girls than on anybody else. And it's no different than any other sport. I don't know where the hell that came from. I mean you have CrossFitters now doing strength cycles or Olympic weightlifting cycles for months at a time. I did that for 10 years. Nothing but an Olympic weightlifting cycle for 10 years. So I came into CrossFit with a 500 pound squat, a 300 pound snatch, a 375 pound clean and jerk. So, I mean, I came into it with this huge advantage of knowing the movements. And so, I mean, that was clearly a huge advantage for me. That's why I've been able to compete at the level I have been so quickly. CASTRO: We're not saying CrossFit is everything because people say that a lot about us now. That we're trying to just say that anything you do is CrossFit. You've got to look at the macro picture. And not just the micro picture. Looking at the micro, what's he doing right now? Oh, he's Olympic weightlifting. He's not CrossFitting. Again, step back and see what else is in the programming. FRONING: The people on the outside looking in to CrossFit think that when they see CrossFit it is only CrossFit metcons. That's what they see that's what they think. You know, the 21-15-9. Or the five rounds of whatever. They don't see I mean, they don't understand it. And so they think, he's not doing CrossFit if he's doing intervals. You're an idiot. That's what CrossFit is. CrossFit is you want to be as strong as you possibly can without it affecting flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, ... any of the other things you know, being too strong affects. But you don't want to have too good of a VO2 max that it affects your other strength numbers or you're losing weight or whatever. People get too caught up in in just CrossFit. Metcons. That they think that's what CrossFit is. That, you know, that's all we do. They're idiots. SPEALLER: And it's no different than any other sport. Um. You know, skiing. I'm not going to go out and skii recreationally the same way I would if I were trying to make the Olympic team. You know, it's a different world. And that's happened in CrossFit and I think people need to start to look at that. And kind of accept that. And start to figure out hey, where do I lie? What are my goals? How am I being realistic? And then just resting and what that is. FRONING: Anyone who has ever been the best at anything or the best in the world at anything knows it takes sacrifice. And hard work. And, you know, there's always it's always in the back of my mind that I'm not doing enough. If I'm competing as an individual there's ... you know and I'm ... I'm not going to be able to be fully involved with my family because I'm always thinking about you know, am I doing enough? You know, I'm falling behind. I'm going to miss things. Somethings going to suffer. Whether it's competing or me being a dad or a husband. And uh ... Being a dad and a husband I think is more important and I don't I don't think that's what needs to, uh, take the back burner. LEBLANC-BAZINET: So I'm ... I'm full-time at school right now. And um I'm really busy. I'm very stressed out. And I have a lot of work to do. So before going to the Games um I just wanted to retrieve myself a little. To like uh well, train at altitude with friends and uh really retrieve myself in somewhere like this. Where it's like beautiful and peaceful. And I have like 5 classes. So it's not ... Wait, you're taking five classes? Yeah, I'm taking five classes. For the summer? Yeah. Oh my god! Yeah! Camille communicating with her classmates via Skype. So it's really hard this summer. Really, really hard. I've a couple ... a couple meltdowns. But I don't know. Meltdowns? Like emotional meltdowns? Yeah, emotional meltdowns like like ... just that's enough. Cami is, uh, pushing a sled in Matt and Cherie's yard. Because she just found out that there's a sled push in the Games. So she's a lunatic. And she ran out to grab the sled. You can do it, Cam. I know. I'm just going to figure out. You got to get real low. There you got it. It's too slippery. Fuck! It's like not fucking moving. I'm getting frustrated. You can do it. Aaaaaa! Damn it. You got to get lower, missy. Mental fortitude. All about mental fortitude right now. Get your feet moving. Keep those feet moving in little choppy steps. Little choppy Cami steps. I can't I'm slipping. God damn it. Auunngh. Ah! Fuck! Aaaa! I don't want to do it anymore. You can finish, Cam. You can do it. You're almost past the part where you started cruising. Try starting it slow. See if that helps. Dave, I tried everything. OK? Like See if you can wish it forward. I tried to! What do you think I'm doing? I'm fucking stupid? Like I don't try to do the same thing every time. You can move that sled. Aaagh! Fuck. Nothing will break you at the Games. Aaaa! I am not doing this a third time. Why not? Yeah ... that, that was enough. That was enough mental training. Why not?! How much more do you want me to flip out? I want you to do it without breaking. Mentally. The cursing, the frustration ... Yeah, that was me trying to fucking push the sled. This is a good example of all married couples working out in CrossFit. And I find it humorous because I'm not the married couple right now. I want you to try to do it without getting frustrated. Well then don't talk the whole time I do it. I won't say anything. I'll be completely silent. The fact that it's hard isn't bad. The fact that it's hard is actually good. Because then she can practice staying in her game. But when you start getting affected by I'm only moving the sled six inches ... or it's not moving ... or my feet are slipping ... those are all like it's circular thinking. And it doesn't help accomplish your task. Ah. Fuck. Aaah. Fuck. Hey! That was way better than the second one, Cami. Yeah, it was weird. I didn't even push that hard. I just pushed over the sled. I think that was it. You said over the sled. Yes. She was like here that time instead of here. My feet were like Over the sled so you're like just walk kind of like ... Yeah, it was like easy. I would have seriously stayed here all night. Good. Like, seriously. That's what we would expect from you. Alright, here we go. 10 feet. Here you go, Cam. I was almost there. That was awesome. That was by far your longest bout. Yeah. I heard a saying once that when you lose your ability to get angry you lose your passion. Oh yeah You know? Oh yeah, I totally agree with that. I always say that the day I stop caring I'm going to stop doing it. What's the catalyst to make it easier for you as opposed to harder? I don't know. Maybe imagine that that exact scenario that we just saw there was at the CrossFit Games. Yeah. And not the 6th try but the 1st try. Then what? Then what do you do different? I think I stay much calmer. Yeah, I just stay much calmer. And just figure it out. I think I can win. But I'm being, um, very aware of the amount of pain that I need to go through to do it. Um, which I think is different than just uh saying I can win. It's like pixie dust in the sky. Um. Like I'm like really trying to get my head into it. To be like ready at the Games to like like get really hurt. Really, really hurt. Because no one is going to give up. So I know that if I go as hard as I can and I do my best and not only my best but I go in that really dark place in every single workout. I should be in a good place. I think every guy there wants to win it. Every one wants to be the best. That's why we compete. Is to prove that we are the best. LEBLANC-BAZINET: Who did their homework? Or who, like, tried to study last minute for the test? LACHANCE: I've never swam in the ocean before. CAMERAMAN: Oh really? Yeah, I'm going to learn today. Today's a great day to learn. Yeah, exactly. It's just like a pool. We're learning how to swim. CAMERAMAN: You're reading an article on how to swim? Yeah. An animated video. An animated video of how to swim on your side. I haven't found the playlist yet, but I was thinking of listening to \"Let It Go.\" From Frozen. Hello everybody, and welcome to the opening event of the 2014 Reebok CrossFit Games. Do you swim in the ocean all the time? No, never. Never been in it once. I'm a little scared. It's dark and scary out in the ocean. CAMERAMAN: Are you saying the opposite of what you're actually saying? Maybe. I feel very attractive with this. I feel like I have a condom on my head. Yeah, my ears hurt like crazy. I'm sitting there like yeah this thing's tight. You guys got Magnum size? Some people have built in floatation devices. Those waves were huge that day. And I had got, like, crushed by multiple waves. I didn't think the salt water would have that type of an effect on me. But your nose is running, you're drooling, you're laying there in the sand doing burpees, and there's snot coming down my face and I'm trying to you're trying to spit and clear your nose. BRIDGES: And I heard there was a shark sighting about a mile south while we were in the water. That's pretty cool. Especially since it's Shark Week. I've been watching Shark Week all week. Rich and I are always side by side in the beach event. It doesn't matter whether we go in the water at the same time we come out of the water at the same time, we finish the reps at the same time ... Always next to Dan. He was breathing on his left, I breathe on my right. And literally every time we would lock eyes. Every single time. So the whole time, every breath I take it's like \"Oh.\" We\\'re just staring at each other. THORISDOTTIR: I was like, I'm out of the ocean! She survived! LIPSON: (SINGING) Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead. Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead. See? I had to do it with my hand. How did the first event go? Um, really well. I'm, um, ... I ... I don't think .... people can even understand how hard I have worked on my swimming this year. Thousands of years alone in the pool no one looking at me, just like getting after it. And, uh, it's just so exciting to, uh, do an event and see all of your hard work pay off. OLSEN: I was back stroking around the pier I heard Joanne say, \"Go, Noah!\" and I looked up and as I was back stroking I gave her a little kiss. Nice! Awww. She caught it. BRIDGES: You see him on his swim? He's a fucking cheetah. He's a water cheetah. He's a fish out there. I'm glad he didn't get eaten by a shark. You know, 'cause he's a fish. And sharks eat fish. GRUNDLER: It's going to be a straight, old-school bro session with these guys throwing down some big weights. For a heavy lift it's one of my favorites. It requires skill, not just raw strength. WOODLAND: Rich Froning at 365. Uh oh, uh oh, Bill. FRASER: Like a reporter asked us, hey Tommy how much are you looking to hit? He said 400. He said, Mat, how much are you looking to hit? I said, one more pound than him. I think he hit 376 and ... 377. WOODLAND: Now Mat Fraser, 377. Trying to beat Tommy Hackenbruck. And he will do it! He's your new leader by a pound! Camille Leblanc-Bazinet trying to lock up second place overall in this event. Everything was shaking. It was like, oh my god! Just stop shaking! And she will get it! She beats Amanda Goodman by one pound. Kara Webb says, why not? I'll go for 250 pounds. On the women's side it's Kara Webb of Australia who sits atop the leaderboard. LEBLANC-BAZINET: The hardest one was the Triple 3. Because I've never pushed that hard in my whole life. Like I've never puked in a workout in my life, and I really thought I was going to faint and puke in this one. That was terrible. It was long and it was hot. BAILEY: Borderline one of the hardest workouts we've had to do at the Games. Especially if you put out on it. You can cruise through that workout and just kind of get it done. But if you go hard, it's pretty miserable. You're hurting for a long time. I lost some feeling in my feet during it. I think because I tied my shoes too tight. And so even on the double-unders I couldn't really feel my feet. And then I started the run. And I think my brother was in there like, Come on, Lauren! Like, run! I was like, I can't feel my feet right now! And I was like, this sucks right now. MCKERNAN: Men and women start filtering across the finish line. Well, where's Rich? Where's Rich? Where's Rich? WOODLAND: We are halfway through the 3-mile run and now Rich Froning starting to walk. Taking a break there. Rich walking during the Games was fantastic. It was awesome. And the dude's walking. Rich Froning is walking on the back side of the run event. I love Rich to death, but uh, if you're the fittest man in the world you can't walk in a run, brother. You gotta just keep moving. Just keep moving. Yeah. BAILEY: It's just there's so much saliva in my mouth. If I try to swallow it I'm going to lose the chance to breath. And I have to breathe or I can't lift up the weight. So. The option gets removed for it to go down the esophagus. It has to come out. It was good. It was real good. I mean, by good I mean ... long and hard. That's what she said. Not to me. Look how small I look in this tub, Ian. (High pitch voice:) Hi, Dad! It's my rubber ducky. Tommy told me one positive. You have an excuse for a small weiner now. Girls, listen up. Best toast ever, Ian. He's just happy I put sun tan lotion on him this morning. You put sun tan lotion on him this morning? Oh yeah. It's the reason I became a coach. It was because I hoped that someday I could put sun tan lotion on Chris Spealler's back. WEBB: I'm not going to lie, I don't love running. And um little runs, yeah. Long runs not so much. Um, but I really work my ass off, and um like I honestly, 100%, from the bottom of my heart that's all I want to do. I want to know that whatever I walk away with at the end of this weekend it was 100% Kara in whatever I could do. And I nearly killed myself trying, so I'm really really happy with that. That was the most painful workout I have ever done. I mean it's so fast and so short, but my quads ... I could barely walk off the field. It felt like I was still pushing the sled probably for 3-4 minutes after I was actually done. My legs hurt so bad. It was unbelievable. It was so painful. Like, everyone our butts hurt so bad for like You think that after pushing the sled the pain would go away in like five minutes like literally your butt hurt for 20 minutes. It was terrible. In competition, in training, that was the most painful ... that was the most pain my legs have ever felt in my life. It was terrible. And I'm laying there and some lady comes over and just starts rubbing ice on my chest. I'm like, what is going on? Like I don't even want to open my eyes, and I can't even tell \"You need the doctor? You need the paramedic?\" I'm like, no go away. Just leave me alone. You like this one? It's good for you, OK? That one's gone. Let's focus on the next one. Should I eat something, or like, take a protein shake? Yeah, take a protein shake. We don't have a lot of time. Because they're going to start calling heats pretty quick. What time do I go at? I can go find out. Yeah, she wants to do well. She's bummed. But, uh, ups and downs, she's going to have them. So, she's going to come back and attack this one. That was going to be the one that I was going to like, bump down a lot on. In my head I was getting ready. All you have to do is ... It's all about just staying consistent. Staying in that ... It's not about the leaderboard. It's about doing this one event really well. That's all you've got to focus on. So let's not talk about, is it good for you? Is it not? Because that does not even matter. Right? Everyone talks about, like, where's the good ones for me? It's always about how much effort you can give to each one. So it's the same deal with this one. Yeah, get out of the sun. Alright. A lot of athletes look to see, is this one good for me? Is this one not good for me? When's the CrossFit coming up? This isn't CrossFit. And it's not about that at all. This is all CrossFit. And it doesn't matter if it's good for you or not. It's what's presented to you. What happened ... what I could have done different ... and then they want to talk about, like, where they are on the leaderboard. Those are two things that don't matter anymore. I'm in 13th place. Which sucks because I wanted this event to get me up to the final heat. Just thought I would be in the final heat. But, it's OK. Um. Yeah. It's OK. Obviously I would like to be higher. Noah Ohlsen, a rookie, is in the top position. But he's being chased by some very experienced athletes in 2008 Games champion Jason Khalipa and two-time team champion Tommy Hackenbruck. Well the test of fitness to this point has been just that extremely varied. We've seen it all. And it's led to an international leaderboard. On top of that, Kara Webb, an Aussie who has traditionally done very well at the Games. Behind her an old favorite competing since 2010 Camille Leblanc-Bazinet. FRONING: James had went out before me and he said go faster than you think you should. It's short. You'll be fine. Just go. And so, that's what I did. WOODLAND: The crowd coming to its feet as the three-time defending champion Rich Froning moves to the barbell. GRUNDLER: He's actually attacking this workout. And the champ is back! Rich Froning demolishing the time to beat. 4:16.63. And Camille Leblanc-Bazinet will do pull-ups all day long. Camille being one of the few, if one of the only, athletes going unbroken on the 21-15-9. That's it, Cam! One, Cami, go! WOODLAND: One more muscle-ups is done, two more muscle-ups is done ... Camille Leblanc-Bazinet will win with 21-15-9 Complex. Yeah, Cami! Wooo! Camille Leblanc-Bazinet still in second but she's closing the gap on Kara Webb. Bridges now taking over third place. Ohlsen the rookie drops to second. And it's the 2008 CrossFit Games champion Jason Khalipa you overall leader. SPEALLER: As much as I wanted to, I don't think I'll realize how special it is to be here and with these people and in this element and in the community like this until I'm gone from it. And I think it's easy to be like, oh my gosh, I've got three huge days ahead of me ... and for me I'm kind of thinking like holy crap day one is already done and I've only got 2 more of these left. And I'm done. Are you like pissed right now, or? Yeah I'm, I'm not happy. You know, I'm not happy with how I performed on that first event, uh. You can have one bomb. Like 22nd or something for me in the overhead squat. It was a good overhead squat for me, but that's pretty low, in terms of points. And then to follow up with another one the following morning that sucked. So, I knew what I kind of wanted to average in terms of place-wise to get myself a shot at the podium and winning. And I'm way off, to say the least. So. That's upsetting. But, you know, you just gotta forget it. That's all done. Focus on what's next, and go as hard as I can at it. Um, another whirlwind of surprises. I think I said this to you earlier, but it's kind of funny how expectations always change throughout the competition. And I, uh, came into today in 3rd place. I did well this morning on the Triple 3. Bumped me up to 1st place. Which was unexpected. Um. Sorta shifted expectations again there. Didn't know how well I would do on the Sled Sprint. Ended up holding my spot. Broke the curse of the leader pants. And then, uh, didn't do as well as I wanted to on the final workout. So then I dropped down to 2nd on the end of Friday. And it's funny cause when I saw that that Khalipa had jumped me I got pissed. And uh it's so weird because coming in to the CrossFit Games I would be stoked to see myself in 2nd place. But having tasted 1st and dropping down to 2nd really kind of fueled me. Um. I want to come back and take it back. I never really realized how much a hundred points helps. Yeah, 100 points is big. Usually I'm like, yeah I'll be up there towards the top. And then I'm like wait 100 points helps ... I mean I've had three crappy finishes. A hundred points is, uh, a lot. I'm going to start trying to take 1st from now on. What am I doing? Now I've figured it out. Now that he's figured it out, and starts winning these events ... What?! I really, I swear like, the way that stadium is shaped there's a lot of energy that like pools in that one little area. It's just crazy. And it you can feel it inside of you as soon as you go to start. It's amazing. So yeah, it's cool. Yeah, so when I first started CrossFit I think I was 19. And I joined a gym because I was just doing the normal 18-, 19-year-old stuff. You know. And I just didn't have any direction. I didn't know I didn't know who I was or what I wanted to do you know, at that age being a female you have insecurities. All that kind of stuff. And um I needed some kind of direction. And my mom told me to go and exercise. And so I did. And then I met Brian. He learned about CrossFit. We started CrossFit. And then all of a sudden I had this sense of achievement every single day. I finished work, and I would go to the gym. And I would progress, and I would do a different movement, and that sense of achievement has just developed more and more. But that's what it's always been. And then it became a social thing with people likeminded. We have a healthy group of people. And um, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. And, and that's the most important thing. Have you been looking where you're at in the standings? Or are you not even paying attention? I know where I'm at, but it doesn't mean anything until Sunday. I mean, you want to be in number one. But it doesn't mean you're going to let off. It doesn't mean you're going to get comfortable. Every event is a new event and you've got to be focused. I want to spend time with the ... I want to enjoy this, you know? Because it's never guaranteed to happen again. So. I need to always remind myself of that. Every day. We basically got to the afternoon of Saturday and I was like Kara Webb won the CrossFit Games. I mean there was very little that she could do to screw this up. Of course anybody could be annihilated but the capacity she showed between the Wednesday event and the Friday and Saturday day was unthinkable. Throughout the weekend you felt like oh man this this could happen. Kara Webb could win. You're all wearing the exact same thing. Rachel Martinez doing the workout a second time? She's in every heat?! Rachel Martinez in Lane 12 ... and Rachel Martinez in Lane 6 ... See? That's how far we go. That's how far we go. Sorry. Nice. So nice. I can't see. He was looking for something over in the bushes. I don't know what he was looking for. It was in his pants. I don't know. Were you peeing? I was definitely peeing. Pretty much wide open. And I'm a little nervous. You just pissed like right there? Right there. Did you just piss too? A little bit, yeah. A little pre-workout jitters. MCKERNAN: Thanks, Sean. It's a unique event. We've seen ladders before but in increments where you were forced to rest. Now the men are racing through and this final weight of 310 lb. that's the average weight of an NFL lineman It's huge. This isn't just Mongo pulls the bar off the ground. You have to have technique. You have to be solid. This event tests it all. That was possibly one of the coolest things I've ever done. The Speed Clean Ladder was awesome. I could feel my heart all the way up my neck. And in every finger I could feel my heart pumping blood. And the enthusiasm when Spealler stood up 275. And when Cody Anderson stood up 310. And Chris Spealler yet again you know, he makes history. I feel like I could run through a wall right now. It was so amped. I think that's when it set in that this is the Games. WOODLAND: Josh Bridges off the wall first. Ben Stoneberg was right behind him. And then a mad dash to that first sled pull. That last leg I wasn't even watching my sled. I was just watching where Rich's sled was at. I was just like I've got to pull as hard as I can. And to beat him by that like one or two seconds. The rush afterwards was just like ... I couldn't even contain it. It was so much fun. That was probably one of the coolest moments of the Games. Fuck yeah! What's funny is I don't even remember screaming that. I kind of blacked out. I don't remember I don't remember saying that. WOODLAND: Still got a long way to go. But Rich Froning sits atop the leaderboard just 7 points ahead of Mat Fraser. Josh Bridges will sit in 3rd. He's just 12 points back. Noah Ohlsen, the rookie, sits in 4th. Kara Webb stays in 2nd place but her 9-point deficit just turned into a 75-point deficit. Annie Thorisdottir creeping closer. She sits in third. And look at Michele Letendre. She sits in 4th place. Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. No, you're fine. You have no idea how much I wanted to yell out, \"Mashed potato!\" Yeah, that was exactly what it looked like. I got it, Dan. Mashed potato, what? Knees in! Bro, you're so mushy! That was exactly what I felt like. That went according to game plan. Which doesn't usually happen. It was very well done. I managed to do the 10 deficit unbroken. So I got my, my edge there. How does that one feel? That one feels good. It's good to end on such a positive note. But can't get caught up with it. We have another full day tomorrow. Got to get back to work. She has bugs flying around her head. You never know what can happen. So, uh, gonna stay, uh, laser-focused and attack tomorrow like it's the first day. And, uh, there's no score. Like everyone's at zero. But, uh, really excited. Um, I'm bummed, man. Yesterday, everybody ... I was bummed I went from 1st to 2nd. And everybody was like, where did you start the day? And I started in 3rd and moved up to 2nd. So you had that to look forward to. Where did I start the day today? In 3rd. Where did I end up? In 4th. So. Moving down is never fun. Um. Like Dusty said we have 3 or 4 more events tomorrow and I'm damned sure I'm going to do my best to get up on the podium. It's not like they were going to let you just roll into the top three, right? These guys came out for blood tonight. WOODLAND: Meanwhile Kara Webb like you thought is having trouble. She has yet to complete her second 50-foot handstand walk. Kara Webb sat in 2nd place coming into this event. She's going to plummet down the leaderboard. She looks like she's in pain right now. Kara is out. She's not competing in the final. What happened? Her shoulder. She had an issue before. Or like felt it before the Games. And then it was fine. But, apparently something happened. MARQUEZ: The workout literally brought her to tears on the field, and it was heartbreaking. It was as heartbreaking a turn as I've seen in CrossFit when it comes to competition. I'm so sorry. You'll be fine. They're really dark. So you were in second place? Yep. And what happened in that event? Um. I, uh, I had a, um, a bit of a nerve upset when I got here to the States. Um. You know, I don't know exactly what it was. It was inflamed. And at one stage I couldn't I couldn't move, I couldn't get out of bed, about a week before the Games. So I had a week off. I did everything I could in that time to give myself a fighting chance to compete. And, uh, I've been able to hold on with the treatment I've had until this stage. And then, I guess, it just took the wear and tear of the weekend and the handstand walk. My left arm has just gone numb. I've just got pins and needles and I can't ... the meds just recommended that for, like Brian said, for the longevity of the sport for me and for my health that it's not wise to go on. So, um, yeah. It breaks my heart, but I'll be back. At the moment I've just got a broken heart. Similar to 2011, the athletes are placed in seclusion to keep the final event unknown to them. OHLSEN: This actually sounds really cheesy and I probably shouldn't tell anyone this, but somebody happened to give me Rich's book the day before I left Yeah. And I was reading it on the plane. Just little pieces here and there. And I was reading a section where Rich was talking about being secluded down here and having no idea what was going on out there. Like you can hear the roar of the crowd but you don't know ... You have no clue what you're about to face. It's cool to read about it and then live it. I was listening to her talk about kids and time with Vin and not having to tell her I have to workout all the time. Because every morning it has been, \"Don\\'t go, Mommy.\" Is that what she says to you? Yeah, so. We'll be looking forward to not having multiple responsibilities. Just having summer break and one responsibility. Just being Momma. Personally, thank you for all your hard work. I appreciate it. Thank you. Absolutely. Yeah, you're welcome. Camille Leblanc-Bazinet is one of the most recognizable faces in our sport. But she has never stood on the podium at the CrossFit Games. Now she finds herself poised to be crowned the Fittest Woman on Earth. In Lane 4, the leader Camille Leblanc-Bazinet! Mat Fraser, the rookie, who's trying to play the role of spoiler. He has a chance of chasing down Rich Froning. The three-time CrossFit Games champion. FRASER: As soon as Double Grace was announced like Rich and I kind of looked at each other like like we knew that, alright, this was a race between us. Jason was right ahead of me so I had to do some work. So I was like, well, I'm this close. I'm almost done. It's the last time I'm going to be in this stadium. I might as well push through and try to win another event. And that's what happened. Leblanc-Bazinet started her Games journey in 2010. She has never stepped onto the podium. That will change. Camille Leblanc-Bazinet with one rep to go. Oh yeah, last year with the last rope climb. Without a doubt. I, um, I don't know. I hit that wall. And I found myself somewhere that I guess I never found myself before. I underestimated the workout which was a complete mistake on my part. And it got me good. And it got me good. I was literally thinking, get me the hell out of here. Like, get me out of the floor. Like I don't know what to do anymore. This is just not working. But that moment was also one of the moments that made me win this year. So I think that all of those moments where you're like, this was the worst thing, I wish it never happened. That's not true. I think everything that happened to me I did wish it happened. Because now it made me just so much stronger. And so much better. Especially knowing that you know, your rower can break. I lost four toenail in the triathlon with the ... the next year. So like I got into that sort of pain. I feel like at the Games this year I was like, if you want to beat me you're going to come with me to that really, really, really dark place. And just be willing to stay there with me. Like, that's where I'm going. So I think you need to understand that that's what you need to do to win. Camille Leblanc-Bazinet with one rep to go! And she is the Fittest Woman on Earth! In 2014, Rich Froning is the fittest man in history! FRONING: You have to be a little crazy to be the best in the world in anything. And there's got to be some sacrifices made. And, um, I'm not willing to make those sacrifices anymore. Just a sense of like just ... just relief. I was just glad it was over, to be honest. SPEALLER: I mean, I got to do something seven times, that most people will dream of doing once. So. I can't be disappointed for that. Chris Spealler! Julie Foucher will finish third and return to the podium for the first time since 2012. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm just happy. Like, I think that's how happy I would feel if I won. Just because I felt like I gave it everything I had. I made it back on the podium, so I'm really, really happy. Is it all worth it? All the stuff you had to do ... Oh yeah. This is the one day of the year where you feel like, OK, everything was really worth it. But it's bittersweet, I have to say. This makes me really want it. You know? Maybe next year is going to be a good year for me. I was so, so happy that I ended on the podium with the people I did. During the awards ceremony it was like a surreal moment of like Jason Khalipa here, Rich Froning there. I'm like, damn, these are the guys I've seen on posters and watched YouTube videos of. These are them. Like, they're right here. And I'm in the mix with them. So what's to say with one more year of training that I can't be number one. It's another year of training. So much can happen in one year. Who knows? Who knows what's going to happen next year. What are you thinking about? I don't know how this just happened. You worked so hard for this. And it ... you know it's ... It's almost hard to believe it can happen just because how hard you worked for it. So when it happened you play the scenario so many times in your head. That it becoming truth doesn't even seem real. It seems like it's still the scenario you play in your head. But it's not. I think I was more crying because I was like tired and really proud of myself that I made it come to life. More than like the title or anything. It was more crying about the journey than the result. CASTRO: 2015 is going to be exciting. 2015 is going to be, um, it's going to be our best work yet. Until 2016. I'm looking at the camera. Can I take this? Real quick. Hey, dude. OK, just like on TV. Did you ever see that Key & Peele where they did the state of inner-city wizarding? I'm ... Pardon Miss Jackson. Principal at Vince Quartel High School. It's mind numbing to think that she can balance those two things when I have trouble feeding my two kids and letting my dog out to take a piss. In the same day. Sorry. It must have like ... Sam Briggs not making it must have been like ... like if you watched the movie Predator. OK when like Arnold has the best team in the world. People who he probably thinks could never get hurt. They're bullet-proof, they're indestructible. And one by one they start going away. And these people you're like ... These are the best in the world and they're not good enough to defeat this creature. This is a terrifying situation, right? I want you to feel comfortable with this interview. Like North Korea. This will never see the light of day!", "_VB39Jo8mAQ": "Translator: Araminta Dutta Reviewer: Queenie Lee I recently completed an unsanctioned, unsupervised psychological experiment on my children, (Laughter) the premise of which was $10,000 in cash on the kitchen table and a sign next to it that said 'Don't touch the money yet!', and before I dive into it, you should know that we are a game-playing family. We play ball games, board games, dice games, card games, all sorts of games, but the games that my children love to play most are games like Monopoly, and when they play Monopoly, they play marathon games of Monopoly that last hours and hours over days of play. Each of my kids has a unique strategy and personality when they play Monopoly. My daughter, who is 11, she is always the dog. She plays entirely for Chance and Community Chest cards; (Laughter) you can say that she uses the 'luck' strategy. My 9-year-old son is always the car - a very strategic player. He buys all of the Railroads and all of the Utilities and then proceeds to put houses and hotels on the most expensive properties - very savvy. And then his younger brother, who is seven, he buys everything that he lands on with no exception, which is fitting because he is the wheelbarrow. Now, before I tell you how my experiment unfolded, I have to share an observation that led me to the creation of it. One Monopoly marathon, Saturday morning, I was playing with my kids and noticed that they were all playing just outside of the rules of the game. So they were doing things like buying each other out of jail and lending each other money to buy properties, and I found myself going, 'Guys, this is not how this game is played!' to which they'd say, 'Dad, it's fine! We just want her on the board with us', or, 'He can pay me back at the end of the game, when he's flush with cash', and I'm thinking again, 'What am I teaching these kids?' So, I started watching how they were playing - listening to their banter, getting a feel for how they were making decisions - and I had this thought: 'What if they're playing this way because the money isn't real?' It's a concept I've been reading a lot about, lately, 'Financial abstraction', the notion that when money becomes more and more of an idea, less tangible and therefore more abstract, it changes the way we interact with it on a regular basis, and there's anecdotal evidence of abstraction everywhere around us. All you have to do is listen carefully to people who say, 'I loaned my child or grandchild the phone, and a month later, all these errant in-app charges showed up on my bill.' In 2014, Apple reimbursed customers for in-app purchases that were unapproved, mostly by children, to the tune of $32.5 million. This is in a US FTC settlement. In the documentation, it said it was just too easy for kids to make an in-app purchase. The Imagineers at Disney were charged with making the parks 'frictionless' - is what they called it - so they invested a billion dollars in a MagicBand. It's a wearable device that functions as your room key, your park ticket, and your ID and wallet when you're on park property. So if your child wants a set of ears and a dessert in the Magic Kingdom, 'bibbidi-bobbidi-boo' - (Laughter) your vacation just cost a whole lot more, magically. Magically. Lastly, I had a conversation with some teenagers who told me that $100,000 a year really wasn't that much money. I said, 'Really? Why do you think that?' They said, 'Well, we both have $500,000 in our ATM machines on Grand Theft Auto', (Laughter) which is a very popular and somewhat sketchy video game. So as I'm playing with my kids and I'm watching them play, listening to them talk, I thought, 'What if the money were real on the table? Would they play differently?' And so I calculated quickly on the box, 'How much would it take in capital, in currency, to play a physical game of Monopoly with my kids so that they actually tangibly got to feel the money in their hands?' And I estimated, for four or five players, it's about $10,000. So one Friday, I stopped at the bank, I got all the denominations of bills on a Monopoly board with the exception of a $500 bill - hard to get - and on Sunday, I rounded the family up for a high-stakes game of Monopoly, (Laughter) where the winner takes all. All of $20, by the way. All of $20. You have never seen kids' eyes light up the way mine did when I handed each of them $1,500 in starter capital, and you have never seen anyone's eyes light up like my wife's when I took it back on Monday. (Laughter) All of it. Our marathon game only lasted two and a half hours - far shorter and more strategic than most of the games they normally play. True to my hypothesis, two of my three kids actually played differently; my daughter still played the 'luck' card. She was the first one bankrupted, (Laughter) and she happily retired to the living room to read a book. My youngest son, the wheelbarrow, did not buy everything he landed on; instead, he carefully calculated how many rolls away he was from one of his brother's properties and how much he would owe his brother if he landed on said property, and made his decisions based on that. In effect, having real money on the table and a cash prize at the end made him more conservative. And my middle son - very strategic - still bought all of the Railroads, still bought all of the Utilities, but did not buy Boardwalk and Park Place or Mayfair and Park Lane, but instead, he put hotels immediately on Oriental and Baltic Avenue, or Coventry and Leicester Square on the UK version. When I asked him why, in his own words, he said, 'Dad, they're just more affordable properties.' (Laughter) At which point, I cried a tear of pride. (Laughter) So he got it! In the end, my son finished with 28 properties, more cash than he'd ever seen and held in his entire life, and he now knows the meaning of the phrase 'making it rain'. (Laughter) Look how happy he is, (Laughter) and how annoyed his brother and sister are. In the confines of my experiment, there is an idea worth spreading, and it is this: I believe kids today are being raised in a world where money is no longer real; it's actually an illusion, but it has very real consequences. Peter Drucker, famed leadership guru, said banking and finance industries today are less about money and more about information, and yet young people today don't get that information; they don't get the experiences of money, early on. Three researchers from the Centre for Creative Leadership, in a study done two decades ago that's been replicated many, many times, they interviewed over 200 executives in a report called 'Key events in executives' lives'. In this report, they found that of the 200 top-level executives who were the top of their game, all of them had similar characteristics. One of them was that early on in their career, they had been thrust into a leadership role that required them to make decisions that had serious consequences. They also had a mentor in place that helped them appreciate the lessons they were supposed to learn from those experiences. The study created a leadership framework that said, in essence, that someone with potential, if given the opportunity to engage in strategically relevant experiences and given the ability to learn the lessons from those experiences, would have a higher likelihood of success in their career in a leadership capacity. Now if you took that study framework and my $10,000 experiment and looked at it through the kaleidoscope, you would get a statement like this: if kids are given financially-relevant experiences in their life and someone is there to help them learn the lessons from those experiences, they have a higher likelihood of achieving financial success later in life, and in my humble opinion, they need to have them early, and they need to have them often. We under this not-so-subtle societal shift in the way that we pay each other, today. It's estimated there are trillions of dollars circling the globe in our global economy every single day, yet only four percent of that money is actually in coin or currency. The rest is all digital, data packets, ones and zeroes, and today's digital-native youth - they don't see people paying with cash or cheques. In fact, if ever you're in a line, and someone in front pulls out their chequebook to pay, you are liable to say to yourself, 'Really, a chequebook? This is going to take forever.' You're laughing because it's true. The currency of today is digital. Many of these kids equate spending with credit and debit cards, with Google Wallet and Paypal and Zap. All of these are what they equate spending to, and by the way, I am not pooh-poohing the technological advancements in payment technology today - far from it. I think tokenisation and randomisation and biometrics are the wave of the future. The first time that I used Apple Pay, it was like showing the caveman fire. It was amazing. But what snapped me back to reality was hearing my son behind me say, 'I sure wish I had a phone so I could buy stuff.' (Laughter) You see, money, to a young person, is somewhat abstract, anyway, and when we further the abstraction by waving a MagicBand or putting our phone over a sensor and giving the thumbprint, all it does is further the abstraction. It's a recipe for financial disaster later in life to the uneducated because, to a young person, they see money as limitless because they have no concept of the backend until it comes around to bite them in the back end. I've seen this firsthand in my work with university students - young people who borrow and spend untold amounts of money, having no concept or understanding of the increase in payments, the decrease in lifestyle, and the challenges they'll face later on. In the UK and the US, student debt is ballooning problem. In the US, we're at $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, second only to mortgage debt in the US. One in three students is delinquent. One in five is in default. It's a huge problem, and the reason that this is concerning for all of us as a global economy is this: Dun & Bradstreet found that people spend 12 to 18 percent more when using credit cards over cash. They have yet to do a study how much more we'll spend with a MagicBand or a phone, but I can imagine it would be 15 to 20 percent, or 18 to 25 percent, and all you need to do is read the headlines in the newspapers and magazines across the world today. Places like The Guardian, The Washington Post, Fortune, Forbes - these are the headlines we're seeing: 'New consumer debt reaching a seven-year high' in the UK, 'Consumer debt hitting an all-time high' in the US, 'Choking on credit card debt', 'The credit card debt crisis: the next economic domino'. It's what happens when people overspend and get in over their head with money. Unfortunately, The Money Charity says that in the UK right now, one person every five minutes and three seconds is either declared insolvent or bankrupt. To put this into perspective, since I started speaking today, two people in this country have declared bankruptcy. In the UK, Demos.org says that Americans aged 25 to 34 have the second highest rate of bankruptcy. 25-year-olds. Everyone's question should be, 'Why? Why is this happening?', and in my simplistic view, it is this: because the money they're spending isn't real - it's an abstraction. So to stem this tide with the next generation, we have to bring them up to understand that they are living in a world where they have to make very real money decisions, in a world money is largely an illusion but has very, very real consequences. Because I want your children and mine to be super successful financially, consider any of the following: If you are going to spend money on children, give them a set amount of money and let them spend it. Let them tangibly feel the money go through their hands. Let them succeed or fail with minor consequences so that later in life, when they're making the major decisions, they understand there are major consequences that go along. For older kids, it's this: set a budgeted amount for school clothes, supplies and what-have-you, give them that amount, and when they are done spending it, it's done. And here's the key; they get to spend it with your subtle guidance, your subtle mentorship, your subtle supervision, and whether you call it an allowance, you call it commission for chores or you call it a weekly stipend, every single child, from the age of five on up, needs to be given some tangible amount of money on a weekly basis so that they understand how to function in a cashless society someday. Better to teach the young the habit of saving when they have a little bit of money to save than try to teach savings when they have no money because they're in over their head. I met an American named Jos\u00c3\u00a9. He was a 20-year-old student at an American university. He was the child of two Cuban-born parents. At the age of 15, his parents told him, 'Jos\u00c3\u00a9, we will give you food, we will give you shelter and we will give you $50 a month, but the rest is up to you.' I asked him, 'What was that like?' He said, 'Clothing, toiletries, school supplies, entertainment, gas - it was all on me. I resented my parents for a year. But you know what? I realised it was the single best thing they could have ever done for me.' When I met Jos\u00c3\u00a9 at 20, he was on a full-ride scholarship at the university he attended. He had $20,000 saved in a savings account from working part-time in high school, and this kid exuded financial prowess and unmistakable leadership potential. At the heart of my message today is this: it does not take a $10,000 board game and it doesn't take cutting kids off financially to make a difference. The first step is, honestly, quite easy. It's about educating the next generation to make decisions in a world where money is largely an illusion but has very, very real consequences, and the reason it's so important for all of us, as a global society, to do this is this next generation coming up will inherit the global economy that we are handing to them, and we will precariously place it on their shoulders. We owe it to them to set them up for financial success. Thank you. (Applause) Thanks. (Applause)", "pni_kDv9BsU": "good morning I recognize what we're gonna talk about this morning is a little bit different than what you guys usually think about as you're doing your daily jobs and things like that but you know Lizzie and Shireen both mentioned a little a minute ago that everybody lies right I mean you all probably been lied to in the past maybe even told a lie or two in the past do I have anybody in the room is gonna tell me they never lie no one okay that's good at least I don't see anyone with the lights on would it surprise you if I told you actually let's do a little experiment first I want you to find someone in the room and I want you to point at them I know it's rude but I want you to point at them and as you're pointing I'm going to point at you who are you Aaron I'm gonna point at Aaron so find someone in the room point at them and then look around to see who is staring at you who's pointing at you okay so then I'm gonna hold your hand up and with this being five and this being zero I want you to end up like everybody to do this for just a moment with this being this big zero this being five tell me how many times you think that person has lied in the last 24 hours okay now look around the room and just just look around the room and see what people are doing and saying okay look around the room okay you put your hands down you can put your hands down let me start by saying you guys are really really polite group because I saw a lot of these I saw a couple of these few of these I didn't have any flashers though normally I do this trainee I got people with both hands flashing they take their shoes off that they could talk about how many times they think people had lied all right would it surprise you if I told you that a person lies an average of ten times a day okay now I know some of you sitting there going no no that's not true I don't like 10 times a day but think about it for just a moment when I talk about lying 10 times a day I'm talking about things like somebody asking how you're doing and you have a splitting headache and you say fine because you don't want to get into it all right so when I talk about lies I'm talking about a complete range from those little white lies that we tell either not to hurt someone's feelings or to keep a conversation from going in a direction we don't want it to go in to those really big bold-faced lies where I didn't do it okay why is this important to you guys why is knowing what a lie looks like to you is important to you whether you're hiring employees you know whether you got a screening process going whether you have an investigation because someone's been stealing from your company and you need to put yourself in an investigative mindset now any of those things that you touch as executives and retail or folks that are involved in retail it's important if you're a buyer and you're going out looking to see if you're getting the best deal on the things that you're looking to buy do you want to know if that's persons telling you the truth or do you want to know if you have a little bit more wiggle room so the purpose of teaching you about lying today and I'm not going to tell you everything about it because we don't have all day but I'm going to touch on the things that are most important to you and I hope that you'll find that they do have something to do with what you guys do on a day to day basis okay if I forget to say this and I usually do I want to say it before I leave when you finish this 45 minutes with me you're gonna be dangerous you're gonna know just enough to be dangerous all right so don't take this home and use it on your significant others not gonna lead you where you want to go children however use it all the time on kids all right I have a 16 year old son if his lips are moving he's lying all right so just setting you up with that so let's get into this just a little bit about me I think they told you it's all over the place actually I am former CIA I still do a lot of work with them but the point is is it's in the CIA that I learned what it looks like when people are lying I have a master's in forensic psychology and education I spent over 20 years with the agency developed a screening program with inside the agency and we actually take this program this to spy the live program all over the world and teach people about lying all over the world so people say to me well Susan if you're teaching everybody what lying looks like can't they use that against you all right if I learn to lie if Aaron learns to lie and I'm interviewing her for a job and she's lying will I see it if she knows how to beat me the good thing is there's so many different things about lying that you can't hide them all so Aaron may be able to lie to me with a couple of sentences but sooner or later I'm gonna figure out she's lying and then I'm gonna go try to find out what the truth is okay so enough about me let's get into this the way I want to start this is I want to show you a brief video all right and I want you to tell me whether Jamie this young lady right here at the end of this video is lying to me or not all right so all and you came into the room today with some gut that tells you whether someone's being truthful or not right we all think we know what deception looks like we all think we know what truth looks like so with that gut that you guys have it tells you whether somebody's truthful or not I want you to judge Jamie we ready to go okay my first question for you TV is what involvement did you have in the companies recently just started bars run for County activities oh nine Oh  these are under direct mr. Glenn to backdate any contracts no of course not  prior to the recent audit that uncovered these accounting irregularities did you have any knowledge that mr. Glenn was back dating contracts no I mean in fact if I had knowledge about that then I would speak up and say something  is there any reason that a forensic computer review would uncover any communication with mr. Glyn regarding this matter no of course I don't have any communication with him regarding this at all  at any time the mr. Glenn ever reveal or discusses efforts to manipulate the company's accountings with you know if he had then I would have told someone fired him gotten something something would have happened if I knew anything  Jimmy why should we believe that you're not I've always had a very good reputation with the company I have no enemies in the company you know when you know i I've always done my best and I believe that I have a very good reputation with that and people trust me and I I would never do something like that especially for something that I've worked so hard at  what do you think should happen to the singing manager who directed this should learn to backdate this contract he should be fired and go to jail and there should be serious consequences  would you be willing to certify in writing that you had nothing to do with these accounting irregularities yes of course I'll sign it right now okay so this was a situation where there's an investigation going on in a company because the accountant had been cooking the books and when we went in to do the investigation we asked him why he was cooking the books they were getting ready to go into a sell the company they were looking to raise the value of the company but he said he did it specifically because he was told to we asked him who told him and he didn't want to tell us so we investigated we interviewed a whole bunch of people Jamie being one of them now I heard a couple of people say she was lying right off the top right and maybe she was and maybe she wasn't but as that interview went on were there times when you caught yourself going no I think she's being truthful and other times when used to nap that's a lie right how do we know whether she's being truthful or not what are we looking for in there let me ask you this question even if Jamie was being truthful did she have a reason to be nervous absolutely right so how do we know whether her nervousness or whether her behavior is a result of nervousness or whether it's a result of not being truthful how do we know that that's what we want to learn right if you have somebody sitting in front of you for a job interview or you're you're talking to someone in a company all your employees in a company because there's been a major theft or there's even been a little theft do those folks have a reason to be nervous absolutely they want to make sure you're getting it right they want to make sure they're coming across in the way they they should come across so how do we know the difference let's take a look at a few things there are six keys to knowing whether someone's being truthful or not or where someone's being deceptive we're gonna look at all of these individually we've got analyzed versus speculate okay what do I mean by that can I look at anybody in this room and say they're there lying to me just by looking at them just by the way they're sitting all right manage your bias every single one of us in this room has a bias we may know what that bias is but we may not know all right just happens week it comes across people recognize it but we don't see it we want to recognize evasiveness what does that look like when someone's trying to evade telling me the truth or it may telling me a deception we want to be aware of aggression aggression is one of the major keys for people being deceptive we're all gonna also gonna look at convey versus convince what do I mean by convey versus convincing and finally we're gonna look at some of those nonverbal cues any of you folks who used to watch lie to me that's what you saw with a nonverbal that's what you saw with the nonverbal so we're gonna look at some of those alright so let's get started oops what the wrong way when I talk about analyze versus analysing versus speculation what I want to look at is how a person is reacting to things okay so I need I need to find somebody who's sitting like I want them to actually you see the gentleman in the back right there who's got his arms resting okay if he were crossing his arms right here like this okay how do we view this behavior how we always been told this behavior is closed standoffish and stuff like that right and a lot of people assume that closed behavior means that they're trying to trying to manipulate me alright they're trying to come across as being truthful alright I'm just gonna hold myself right here so that nobody knows that I'm lying well you know what maybe he's standing that way because he's cold maybe he's standing that way because it's comfortable for him alright that just may be a habit form I don't want to turn around and say look close posture equals deception because if I do that I'm getting myself in trouble so a lot of us look at global behavior all right we look at weather they shift all the time we look at weather weather they you know do some of the stuff that Jamie did when she scratched her nose all those sort of things we give way too much weight to global behavior we want to do away with that that is speculation I don't want to speculate why why that gentleman in the back is sitting there with his arm across like that alright what what I want to do in other words is I want to identify that the behaviors that I see in here are a direct result of my question so if I ask Aaron Aaron did you did you take the missing merchandise alright and and and she's sitting like that that's that's bad that would if I look at that as a global evaluation that's bad I don't want to give her that alright I want it I want to see the behaviors and hear the behaviors as a result of the question I ask and it'll make sense in a minute I want to identify the stimulus the stimulus in this case whether it's an investigation whether it's a screening interview whether you're talking to someone that you want to employ in your organization the stimulus is going to be the question that I ask all right during any interview during any communication people are going to move I want that movement to come when I ask the question okay not when they're just sitting here having a conversation and never make again more sense in a minute I want to focus on the behaviors that are directly as I said we associate it with the response do you say and do something as a response of my question okay one of those deceptive behaviors and I'm going to rely on what we call timing and clusters and this is really the big deal the timing of clusters thing so for example when I ask a question I want that person to show me a deceptive behavior within the first five seconds after I ask that question if they don't show me a deceptive behavior of the list that I'm going to show you in a minute and within five seconds they're not lying to me they're not lying to me okay I need to see you're here one of those behaviors in the first five seconds if I see the first behavior in the first five seconds I don't have to see another behavior for two or three or five or ten seconds all right but I do have to see that first one in the first five seconds now not trying to be catty here but I've seen CEOs that can live for 15 minutes on one question okay there's a behavior I'm going to show you that allows you to see that how that happens but what I want to make sure is that the first be happens in the first five seconds so this is what it looks like you're all bright people you know what five seconds is okay my other my other thing I want to pay attention to are clusters and this is what makes a difference in our deceptive behaviors versus other people's deceptive categories and techniques I want to see more than one deceptive behavior within that first five-second right within that answer so I've got these which are verbals ends that are non verbals I want to see at least two or more behaviors for that to be a deceptive answer does that make sense so by c1 I might not like it I'm going to pay attention to it but I really want two or more so if I'm saying that my first behavior has to be within the first five seconds right and I need two or more deceptive indicators do I have a deceptive answer here I do right now you notice that I've got one that that happens before I actually finish the question that question stimulus I'm asking you a question and I get a nonverbal deceptive behavior I'm gonna count that even though it's not within my first five seconds why do you think up someone might give me a nonverbal or a verbal deceptive behavior before I finish the question exactly they're starting to frame their answer and guess what they think faster than I talk all right they say that the average person talks 120 to 150 words a minute the brain goes much faster than that okay some some behavior let's say it goes at least 10 times faster some be able to say you can't measure because we don't think in words we think in concepts all right so if somebody gives me a verbal response or a nonverbal response before I finished my question it's simply because their brain is going faster than my mouth is all right and then I've got that outlier there that nonverbal that lies outside of that first five seconds am I going to count that what I am right Aaron I'm gonna count why am I gonna count it exactly because I had one that happened within the first five seconds right so any behaviors that I keep singing that fall outside that first five seconds before I ask another question is gonna be part of my cluster so if I've got one I've got seven here right that tells me I've got a liar that tells me I've got a person who's not being candid and by the way we never call him a liar we just say they're not being candid okay so I'm not I've got somebody who's not being candid with me what if I had just two inside that first five seconds would that be a truthful answer would that be a deceptive answer it would be deceptive right now is that lie right there a bigger lie than the person who only shows me two deceptive behaviors we have no way of knowing right we have no way of knowing that that two deceptive behaviors could be my son telling me it isn't at homework I'm sorry that one could be my son telling me he doesn't have homework all right the person who shows me two deceptive indicators might be a really really bad person but it comes down to how much someone's buying into the lie how important is it for me to convince you I'm being truthful and at the end of the day when people are doing this kind of stuff what they're trying to do is manipulate us okay manipulate us to believe them all right manipulation is a big thing but that's what they're doing they're doing and saying things to manipulate our thoughts about them okay so timing in clusters that's our most important thing timing in clusters we want to manage your bias all right now it says up here that I want to ignore truthful behavior why do you think I want to ignore truthful behavior any thoughts  good okay right we're inherently good is everybody inherently good I mean she's right she's absolutely right you know look we were all raised to be good people well at least 90% of us in the room were raised to be good people I can't speak for everybody right but we were taught lying was wrong right and your parents tell you lying was not a good thing to do all right did your parents ever say to you look if you lie you're gonna be in twice as for trouble that you would have been if you had just told me the truth and done something wrong right so we know lying is wrong at least that's that's what we've been taught that lying is wrong deceptive people can give us truthful answers so if you ask a question of a person that they're comfortable answering they can answer that truthfully okay any discussion that you have any interview any any again anything that you're doing you're your buyer you're talking to folks and you want to get to the truth is this your lowest price and people are doing things to convince you that that's the lowest price let's start with that okay they are going to do things they're going to say things to convince you that that's the lowest price you are having a conversation with them you're trying to determine is it the lowest price what else can I get just lots of questions that you have you're taking notes you're thinking follow-up questions it is like getting a drink of water out of a firehose there's too much going on if I tell you forget about looking for truthful behavior because you will see it on some questions forget about looking at truthful behavior then that cuts your job half in half right now you're getting a drink of water out of a garden hose as opposed to out of a firehose all right it makes things a lot easier but truthful people or deceptive people who give you truthful answers make it look like they're good folks they're cooperative folks they're gonna give you everything that you need to get all right in reality what they're doing is convincing you that they're being truthful because you saw one good answer not several good answers okay for this a moment let's go back to Jamie what did Jamie do that made you think she was deceptive what'd she do somebody said somebody said she was lying right out of the box what does she do  okay she can't she touched her face her feet were tapping what else she was blinking on too quick to answer all the questions okay conversely what did she do that you liked did all of you think she was guilty good what did she do that you liked okay okay that's good and were you the one that yelled out she's lying okay no no no I knew it came from that direction but but that's good right so it was one of these Scituate of these situations where you were yes yes no yes no that is every conversation that you will have with people sounds good sounds bad sounds good sounds bad how do we split between the two did I see it hand up over there yes  yeah I didn't decorate the room I just did the interview but no you're absolutely right and that's when I talk about people manipulating our perception manipulating us to believe them that's exactly what I'm talking about because there were some questions that she answered pretty pretty nicely right there are some questions that she didn't what we what we do in a lot of situations is we ask people for example we do an investigation inside the organization you know one of our questions will be what do you do here and most of the people will just give you a job just hi a job title alright but the people that we know are already setting out to manage our perception will give us this long Job Description okay that goes way beyond what we're asking for so they gave us so much information and the purpose of that is again to convince us that they're good people well what happens when I hear if I if I'm a novice and I hear a truthful answer I start to think that's a good person it's a self-fulfilling prophecy okay I start to believe they're good I start to believe that they want to they want to cooperate and when I talk about the halo effect that's what I'm talking about so if I'm not looking for deceptive behavior and looking for truthful behavior instead I'm gonna find truthful behavior and it's gonna convince me early on that that person is good and then I'm gonna miss the bad I like the fact that you guys brought up a couple things that's gonna be here later I like the fact that you saw the feet moving I like the fact you saw the nose thing scratching your nose but which is right is she truthful or is she deceptive what makes us right alright so we're gonna talk that we're gonna get more into that alright I want to recognize evasiveness have you ever asked someone a question and they've talked for 10 minutes and then you realize they never answered the question you asked okay right I mean it it happens all the time if you ask somebody if you ask somebody is that your best price and they go through all these things tell you all these reasons why that's their best price but they haven't said no okay they've not given you the answer that you've asked for if you're if you're interviewing somebody for a job and you ask them if they've ever had problems with a with a provider or problems at a job and they give you all these great reasons for why they're a good employee but they never answer whether or not they had any problems in a job but we don't hear it because we're not thinking we're not listening for whether they answer the question or not we're just listening for whether answer so we need to make sure that they're actually giving us the information we're asking for the other thing is what we call failure to deny the most important thing to the honest person is giving you that answer denying if they didn't do something that's the most important thing the truth is their biggest ally so they're gonna want to deny something if they haven't done it okay they're gonna want to deny anything that is going to make them look better if they haven't done it so that's we need to listen for people to deny stuff then we have what we call exclusionary qualifiers now by exclusionary qualifiers I mean things like saying for the most part fundamentally not really not really exclusionary qualifiers beg for a follow up question all right absolutely beg for a follow up question now poor Aaron sat here right in front of me so I'm gonna be picking on her for the whole presentation but let's say okay I've met Aaron let's say I met Aaron last night and I really want to make a good impression with you guys so I go to Aaron this morning and I say hey Aaron look do you think what I'm wearing is okay for today now I realize I realize the conflict here because I'm sitting in front of a whole bunch of retail people okay some of you who sell clothes so I realize I'm putting myself right in the mix here but let's say the Aaron Darren do you see anything wrong with what I'm wearing and her response is not really  think about this for a moment not really okay so you know if I'm in my optimistic mood which doesn't happen very often but I'm in an optimistic mood and I hear not really I think oh I'm okay right what I'm wearing is okay but if I don't hear it from an Austin output optimistic standpoint I hear it from a negative one I go oh really so my next question to Aaron is gonna be what that's my next question to Aaron okay well Aaron if there's if there's something you had to pick that you don't like about it what would it be you don't have to answer that I just want to see if you would know but you hear what I'm saying if somebody says not really it's begging a follow-up so my fault it's got to come because if I don't ask that follow-up I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get it all right I'm not gonna hear it I'm not gonna hear what the real answer is so if somebody says to you well fundamentally this is the way we do things or for the most part this is the things that we that this is the way we do things they're cutting something out we want to know what it is that they're cutting out so you have to ask that follow-up question well okay that's what you do basically but what did you do in this situation okay so that's exclusionary qualifiers I have used one of these before all right aggression attacking the questioner let's say you've had a theft and you're interviewing all of your employees all right and and you ask them did you did you have anything to do with this did you remove any of this information right and make just come back at you and say you guys always think it's me you know it's just because the way I was born or how I dressed or whatever if you always think it's me and they question they attack you you know how and you don't even in this store you don't even know what goes on people walk in and out all the time that's big all right when I talk about different behaviors there's some behaviors that way more than others aggression is one of those okay if you have somebody who jumps down your throat because you ask them a question I don't even care if it's your kid you know yet you say to your kid what did you do last night and they're like why are you always asking me this you don't trust me why don't you trust me okay what ever ever done all right you got a problem you got a problem all right attacking a third party all right it's the same sort of thing you know it locates the stores fog the store doesn't have very good security all right it's it's it's you know we have we don't have what we need in here you know you guys never bring the right stuff in of course that's gonna disappear because we can't sell it all right they're attacking the third party right again it's a big deal any time you're talking about aggression any sort of attack it's big demonstrating an inappropriate level of concern opposite ends of the spectrum you ask them a question you ask him like an important question and they're like oh please you know oh here we go again those sort of things or they just get angry they go from 0 to 124 for really no reason you just ask a question that's it let me give you a small example of that and you know in aggression can be words I mean concern can be words or it can be it can be what they do on their face any of you guys in here remember Scott Peterson great that killed us was convicted of killing his wife and unborn child Laci okay eventually he was convicted but before when he was sitting in jail there was an interview that they had with Diane Sawyer and leading up to it and Diane said but Scott here's the question everybody in America wants to know did you kill your wife now probably most of us would sit there and if we hadn't killed our spouses would try to figure out the right or would know the right things to say what Scott Peterson did and said was he smiled first thing he did was he smiled he goes I love my wife no no I wouldn't I wouldn't have kept I wouldn't kill lazy but he smiled how weird is that you made the hair on the back of my neck stand up somebody's just asked you if you killed your wife and unborn child and you're smiling okay so anyway in an appropriate level of concern now here's where I want to get into what you guys are talking about a minute ago this can this could convince versus convey if I ask what's your name Tiffany because I'm really tired of picking on poor Aaron even if I ask Tiffany Tiffany did you take the merchandise okay what are the two answers that Tiffany can give me that would let me know whether or not she took the merchandise what are the two appropriate answers that would convey information yes or no yes or no but what if I say Tiffany did you take the missing merchandise and she runs into this hole look I'm a good employee I've been loyal to this company for so long I've never done anything that would give you any reason to think I'm less than than a stellar employee what is she doing here is she conveying information is she trying to convince me of something she's trying to convince me of something right she's trying to convince me she's a good employee that nobody should ever have any question about okay that is what you're going to hear most of the time a convincing statement is the the strongest arrow that any person's going to have in their quiver okay saying I'm a good person I'm a good worker all of those sort of things when you talk about trying to try to manage someone's perception let me think about it think about it for just a moment because maybe Tiffany is a good person maybe Tiffany is a stellar employee maybe she had a bad day she took something and now she doesn't know what to do so when somebody's trying to convince me of something going back to minute ago when I said people can talk they can they can answer a question for ten minutes but never answer the question I asked they can talk all day when I said I've seen CEOs alive for twenty five minutes on a single question that's what I'm talking about they'll start talking about how healthy their company is how great their sales are how wonderful their employee and their management team are what they're doing is trying to convince me not convey information to me okay convincing statements are so strong let me give you another example from history you guys all remember our last name Susan the woman who put her children in the back of the car or in the car and their car seats and Susan Smith thank you how can you forget Smith okay Susan Smith she put her kids in the car seat you know push the car into the like way into the cops and said that somebody had carjacked her car right we were doing a training session for some for some law enforcement in Indiana and these gentlemen happened to be in the class they're from Union South Carolina they happen to be in the class and they came up and they said Hayden we now know how students Smith initially beat us when she came into the police station she ran into the station she's crying she's hysterical somehow I got to hijack my car my kids are in the car citizen did you have anything to do with it Susan Smith's answer was I love my children I would never harm my children why would I hurt my children what did you not hear you didn't hear a denial right you didn't hear her say no I didn't what you did hear her say was I wouldn't hurt my children guess what wouldn't and didn't aren't the same thing somebody says I wouldn't do something it's not the same thing as saying I didn't do something we have to listen for didn't okay we have to listen for the words what people are saying not what we think they say because when our thought doesn't make sense for someone to kill their kids right in fact in fact we said to them we said well what did you say to her and why did she beat you and they said because what she said made sense now for just a moment they hadn't done an investigation yet right she just came in she's crying she's hysterical she's got all this stuff going on they have no proof of anything other than the fact of what she's standing there telling them and so they say you know we said it what did you say what did you say we said what we asked her why she would say that and you know we got this behavior we didn't like this behaviors we finally said to her we said Susan look sometimes things happen and you know your parents your parents get out of control and for just a moment you know just a moment maybe something happened and she just continuing with no I love my children I would never hurt my children blah-blah-blah-blah-blah okay so what we say is when you hear convincing statements and you're you have no investigation in Susan Smith's case what you have to do is go hmm I just heard three protest statements or convincing statements I love my children I would never harm my children I do nothing my children I don't hear a denial if we talk about clusters being two or more do I have a lie absolutely right I've got the I've got the not I'm not answering or not giving me a denial and I've got three what we call convincing statements okay now convincing statements sounds so true or in this particular case eerie beautiful irrefutable let's say this the officers say to Susan so Susan look you say you didn't kill your wife I'll kill your kids prove it prove it and she goes I love my kids I take care of my kids I take him to church they're happy they're well fed they're well clothed all this sort of stuff now mr. police officer what do you have at this point they got nothing so convincing statements sound really true again Tiffany may be a good person but that didn't answer my question okay so guess who I'm gonna be looking at I'm gonna be looking at Tiffany okay referral statements referral statements are statements that people make over and over again to try to convince you didn't do anything wrong all right so let's say let's say this young lady standing up back right here let's say she went outside to go to the bathroom while I'm standing here talking she comes back in and she was hey Susan let me interrupt for just a sec I need you guys to know that there are sort of little green men running around the hallway and what's our first impression of this young lady who just walked in right okay but let's say she does know I know I know it's hard to believe but I'm telling you some little green men running around out there now what are we inclined to do go look right so she's now starting to bring us in we're starting to believe a little bit about what she says that again is perception manipulation all right invoking religion people will talk about you know swear on stack of Bibles I swear to God and the counting world I swear on GAAP you know all these sort of things that that people all these sort of things that people will tell us because let's face it and this more specially in this world of political you know rightness and everybody wanting to be good and not step on anybody's toes somebody throws out religion what are you having your backpack your purse your desk drawer that beats religion okay that's a dangerous dangerous one perception qualifiers are a little different than exclusionary qualifiers perception qualifiers are that that people say and do to dress up their lie to verbally dress up their life things like well to tell you the truth honestly frankly as some of you are maybe sitting in this room and saying Oh crepe these are that's the common phrase for me I'll say that stuff all the time right it's a habit okay you're lucky because we're looking at clusters okay so you get your frankly you get your honestly it's when you start having start having more and more because deception and your answer that we're gonna pay attention okay nonverbals now a lot of times people will say to me well Susan if you say that the behaviors start within the first five seconds I'll beat you and just not do or say anything for five seconds well unfortunately for you a behavioral pause is a deceptive indicator okay now for just a moment you have to think about this because you have to ask yourself if you get a pause so the question makes sense for a pause so if I say the Aaron for example Aaron let's see January 26th ten years ago what were you doing does that allow a pause right okay so it's only fair that she gets a pause there but what if I say so Aaron January 26 ten years ago did you rob the bank of America yet see she answered that pretty quickly right if they had taken her time to think about that answer you guys got to look at your hiring policies okay because that would have been a problem all right verbal nonverbal disconnect what I want you to do it once you do a little trip for me for another little game for me for a moment I want you to look at the person sitting next to you before you do it though look at me I want you to look at the person sitting next to you and I want you to say do you like me okay and I want that person to go yes I like you very much okay and then I want you to switch so do it real quick because we're how much time  okay okay all right okay all right I don't have a lot of time okay did that feel weird did that feel weird all right and that's telling you to do that okay that's telling you to do that and you find it hard to do you're deliberately doing it if you see someone do that it's huge it means their brain is so fried that they're not doing what their body is made to do okay now everything that I'm talking about with example with exceptions to that one verbal nonverbal disconnect is cross-cultural cross-gender you can use it anywhere in the world this one is one of those you cannot all right you can't because they're India for example they that's how they answer all right but every place else you can use the verbal nonverbal disconnect you just have to know your audience a little bit anchor point movements anchor point movements are the things that anchor you to the ground to the world to the earth for example my feet right now would be anchor points if my arms are like this they would be anchor points if you asked me a question and in response to that question I move my arms or my legs that's an anchor point movement all right you mentioned the feet if I'm sitting in a chair my bottom is my anchor point my back is my anchor point my feet are my anchor point feet are always anchor points all right we all women especially ABBA tend to sit with their legs crossed and we have that foot that's dangling we call a hanging anchor point watch it because that's where it's gonna go that person is trying to maintain control of themselves it's going to go to that floating anchor point grooming gestures things that people do to again dress up the lie they might fix their tie they might fix their hair they might look at their watch anything like that that would be dressing up the life physically and then finally hands to the face okay if some if someone is in a flight-or-fight syndrome or flyer fight phase which means that they rather than tell you the truth they're gonna try to keep it in they're gonna do stuff the the blood vessels at the ends of the fingers and the ends start to shrink and itches so they will start playing with their their nose or their ear or scratch their hands or like that so hands to the face are huge okay any questions you want to know the shot at her oh yes sir  there seem to be an art or science around the pauses that you had after every question can you talk a little bit about yes I can it means I'm cutting my can you ask me in the answer question session I do what I'm supposed to do okay all right let's but but you're absolutely right let's look at her real quick think about things that we talked about think about what you guys mentioned earlier about you would like the fact that she was answering his questions more but that's not good okay and she didn't really answer the question so the more people talk the worse it is okay so let's go my first question for you Jimmy is what involvement to do have in the companies recently discovered far as we went accounting activities oh nine  appropriate level of concern feet move did you make you write to mr. Gulen to backdate any contracts no of course not feet move an appropriate level of  prior to the recent audit that uncovered these accounting irregularities did you have any knowledge that mr. Glenn was back dating contracts no I mean in fact if I had knowledge about that then I would speak up and say something  convincing statement I would spoke up move  is there any reason that forensic computer with you would uncover any communication with mr. Glenn regarding this matter no of course I don't have any communication with them regarding this at all I'm okay with that one except for the feet move but that's the only one behavior at anytime mr. Gulen ever reveal or discusses efforts to manipulate the company's accountings with you know if he had then I would have told someone fired and gotten something something would have happened if I knew anything I had some against some convincing statements feet love feet Jamie why should we believe that your I've always had a very good reputation with the company I have no enemies in the company you know and you know I I've always done my best and I believe that I have a very good reputation with that and people trust me and I I would never do something like that especially for something that I've worked so hard at ok I'm gonna end that because I think we all see the convincing statements we see the feet and things like that I'm not going to just go through the rest of the questions how do we feel about her now she's a liar yeah well just so you know at the end of my rope my role in this investigation was not only to find the person who was being deceptive but to confront the person who I thought was being deceptive just so you know she showed over 26 deceptive behaviors in that short interview ok for me it was a neon sign I knew immediately it was her okay so anyway there's the keys to success the ones that we talked about Shireen's gonna come up here I know we got a couple questions so can I answer his question ok they're done so yes I put pauses between my questions and the answer the reason for that is because you make it just south of being uncomfortable people have a tendency to want to fill in quiet spaces and a lot of times they'll do those quat though they'll fill it in with convincing statements or other things that will be deceptive if I don't see anything else then I'll ask the question but I always try to wait at least three or four seconds before I ask my second question because if my if I'm machine-gunning Adam and asking questions it makes them very comfortable to just answer real quickly I have a really quick question for you cuz we're almost out of time but how does it how does all of this work on the phone um good question it does work on the phone obviously you lose the verbal I mean the nonverbal so you don't see the person moving or anything like that but you can hear the chair squeak when they move back and forth in the chair what you'll be paying more attention to is the verbal obviously listening for whether they're doing any things that we that we talked about here and be careful very careful when you're on the phone interviews about mind drift don't be thinking about what your next question be thinking about what they're saying in their answer okay yes that's that's a good question the behavior if you're doing the verbal you account for nervousness okay if you're if you're looking the timing and clusters thing again nervous behaviors nervous behavior but you're looking for the timing and those deceptive behaviors and once you see those you'll start to see the nerve you don't care whether they're nervous okay because people do stuff and you don't know how people manifest nervousness versus deception so you really have to follow the behaviors the timing and clusters and the behaviors because you everybody wants to get it right so we we do and and I gave you the short and dirty of all this stuff there's actually a book out we wrote cost by the lie which has a lot more detail in it and can help you as much as you want a little plug we also do training all around the country if you guys think your company might want their training at one of your your off sites or something like that we would come in and give you a longer presentation our normal presentations like three and a half hours thanks guys  couple quick housekeeping", "0F9Qd2pmIMs": "", "h-rRgpPbR5w": "Translator: Ahmed Alahmary Auditor: Riyad Almubarak Happy day, It gives me great pleasure to speak again on (TED Talk) Today I will talk to you and about you I hope to tell you About an idea that made a huge difference in my life And I hope that you make a big difference in your life too! I spent my life devotedly to studying humans. When I was a child, I was the youngest of four brothers So I spent most of my time watching my brothers and sisters And I watch them mess up and take on challenges, While I try to pay attention to my way of avoiding all of this. Then I had a great opportunity to train as a practicing physician, Some of you may know That obtaining medical training is an irreplaceable opportunity! Because you become in close and personal connection with human suffering, On all levels and every day. I was in one of the rooms and watched people die in front of me. It is a truly profound moment! I was also in one of the rooms where life was born in this world. I helped give birth to a number of births, including three of my four children. Someone is sitting in the back, Hello, son! (Laughter) (Son's voice in the audience) Hello my father! So medical training is a great experience! I became a researcher, initially I specialized in immunology, She studied in depth, including nano-minutes Related to the way white blood cells circulate inside our blood vessels While the adhesion molecules are very smart cells It sticks and exits between the endothelial cells, It works to fight infection. Most recently as a neuroscientist, also at the nanoscale level. And also on a much larger scale. I had the opportunity to work alongside CEOs and leaders from around the world In some of our major and multinational companies, Looking at the elements of hidden social relationships, and the available networks, That determine the company's success or failure. As you have heard, I worked with a selection of athletes to help them win gold medals. I read a lot, and learned a lot. And during all of that time, there was one question that worried me, As if something is digging in my brain. The question is: If you can teach yourself, your children, or anyone else, one thing So what will be? What will this one thing be? You can only teach one thing, Among all the things I learned and understood, This is what I want to share today with you. What is this one thing? I can tell you that it is not \"eating an apple\" then it is not intended. We will talk about it. But first I want to go back to your story. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if you remember, But there was a time before you knew you were there. It might be considered for some of you last Friday night, after being drunk. (Laughter) But as we get older, there comes a moment in our life, It is really a beautiful moment if you witnessed it, You see it - almost a year old Perhaps a little earlier, or a little later - almost in the first year of life When the child realizes that he is in a physical entity. It is that moment when they look in the mirror, as if to say: \"Oh, that\\'s me!\" They move their hands, and their hands move. And they realize they are. Let's say they became aware of their bodies. But they have not yet developed awareness of their emotional self, This is the reason for the weariness of those who are two years old. When the two-year-old starves, The world becomes hungry, so why not eat? So there is something like heartburn, it is centralized at the age of two. Here they begin to test the strength. In the market, The situation is: \"Mom, mom, this, this, me, me, food, food, me, me, me, food,\" And they annoy you greatly. And again, it can be seen, at this moment when they suddenly realize They are not only physically separate from you, But their feelings are not yours. Perhaps you've seen this With a child walking down a path in the market His eyes are shining red, shouting with frustration and discontent Because they couldn't get what they wanted, Then they look at you completely amazed, Their mouthpiece: \"Why don\\'t you cry?\" \"We are hungry, we want that chocolate.\" (Laughter) Their eyes startled, Look like idiots look! And here comes the awareness of the emotional self, Separated from the parents or the caregiver. And that's kind of an elevation to a higher level, But it is not complete before they reach the age of three to six, Until they enter the \"cognitive mental self\", Part of this shift is related to a sense of identity. So this is what you would have known through awareness, That is, they become conscious, Not only are their feelings separated from their bodies, But they have identities Where it crystallizes between the ages of three and six. And one of the things that happens During the stage of development of the cognitive mental self is language. In essence, language is understandable: sounds that represent something. Thus, the cognitive mental self is formed. And we start naming our world, As you know: a cat, a dog, a bat, a ball, a window, a floor, and so forth. Then the world becomes understandable to us and we can move around. Children three to six years old They learn about six words a day. The phenomenon of language acquisition is at its height. But starting from the fourth level Which is called physical awareness, They start learning the rules that control concepts. Then everything becomes understood: Why a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat? Why is father a father, and a mother a mother? What is the rule? Then between six and nine years of age Fun begins to appear. So if you talk to a seven-year-old You can start fun by playing invert the rules. For example: See your cat barking? No! Cats meow! It does not bark! This makes them laugh because you play with them against the rules. A rule is established in its entirety For children aged six and nine. And here is where most people are They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave their place ... (Laughter) Most of you will meet: 20, 30, 40 They are inside: 9! (Laughter) This happens with them all the time: They simulate children, and act like them! Very common! And there is an attempt that always occurs in the early teens, To bypass the perceived self, and bypass the rules, This is the reason behind the differences in adolescence. You'll see this while parents try to hold it back, Like a bad thing. It is the stage of growth! This behavior should not be suppressed, they are testing the rules. Therefore, this battle results from: She told me to be at home at ten, and I want to go back at eleven. You taught me to be honest; while you are not honest, The battle erupts! They will live the entire teenage years. Regardless of who wins the battle, whether mother, father or child, It only lasts for a few years. And ultimately, far away from who wins the battle, They leave the house. We hope so! (Laughter) (clap) They go! is not it? But a very large parent called society is involved in the game To impose its rules. And therefore most people involve their perceived selves, It is not a transformation, but a return to the physical by following a set of rules. The belief arises that we must have a degree, We have to get a job, a car, a house, and have a family, We have to get all of these things in order to comply with good social responsibility. Then we start following the rules, then we join a company, And we start working up to the top of the career ladder, By following the rules. So many of those you encounter are returning to this tangible, Their lives become typical. You'll see people talking about it: \"Our way of doing this is different in this company. You will be the CEO, and I will be the chief financial officer. This is what we do here. \" It is a set of rules that we all adhere to, And often without awareness of us. This is the case for the remainder of your life. You will not even realize your movement according to the rules. By the way, these rules you didn't get after getting your approval; Simply imposed by parents or society. Unconsciously from us even. If you are lucky, you are afflicted. At some point during your life, A terrible thing happens that forces you to scrutinize the rules. Now, most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen to them, And if it happened, it does not push them to scrutinize. It could be losing a lover, The end of a relationship, or anything terrible might happen, In general, it is very common that it occurs in middle age. Then we enter the stage we call \"disease of meaning\", Begin to occur; There is something wrong with the image of your life. I follow all these rules, and I have not reached a conclusion. I thought I had a good social responsibility, I got a job, a great house, I paid taxes and all that, I will live forever happy happy; But I am not! This is \"sickness of meaning\" and this is the true pain. If this happens in a religious context, people will say about it as purification of sins. I mean, literally, this is hell on Earth. People slip at this point and often start to taunts, They become indignant, passive and so on. Because they are mainly suffering. We now have two ways to deal with this pain: The first way students like it a lot, Anesthesia! (Laughter) If I could obscure the meaning of life, Which is almost an existential question, If you drink too much on Friday evening, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to think about the meaning of all of this. The question is simply erased. And so some people go overboard every night, some go over the weekend, Whether with alcohol or drugs. The problem is when the headache after taking the drug goes away, Where the question comes back, because it still exists! You can not answer. If you are smart, you will realize that narcotic drugs will not help you. Then it proceeds to the second method, which is distraction. There are different types of distraction. Distraction can happen simply when you go to the gym constantly. Lift some weights. Because when I feel hot, I don't have to think about the question. It becomes \"beautiful body\", I never leave the gym. You get endorphins catalysts and so forth. But you really realize after you leave the gym, That question came back again! So the gym is not a solution. You might resort to a very popular method: The sex ... is not it? Because when I'm in sexual intimacy, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to think about the question, because I am very busy with what I am. (Laughter) But you may have noticed when you are done, That this violent question comes back again! So some people get more reckless: I'll have sex with two people, (Laughter) And then with a group, Desperately trying to escape this annoying question: \"The meaning of their lives\" If sex doesn't work - and it won't work eventually - You are drowning in materiel: shoes! I will go and buy some shoes. Car, house or yacht. So we fall into the material world, Or, as we see them often in industrial activity, they become obsessed with work, They become addicted to work. Because while I work hard, I have to get things done, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to think about this question. None of that solves the problem! Because we think wrong That the problem is there and the solution is there. While the real problem is here. You will not be able to treat emptiness, anxiety, With an external solution, outside yourself. So stop looking over there, and look over here, And to look specifically to experience your feelings. Most people now continue their lives completely unaware of their feelings, Especially those of our age, right? If someone said the word \"feelings\", we would flee to the top of the hills! Emotions are mobile energy, which is a complex of biological signals: Compound of the total heart rate, Sweaty palm area, muscle strain, Or anything that happens biologically, They are repetitive energy patterns, moving energy; they are feelings. And now everyone has feelings, every second and every day. Even we are at this age. However, the sensations are something completely different. Feelings are energy awareness within our minds. So energy is always there, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily have to feel it, And here we stop, We have not really learned to understand our feelings. So we continue our lives ... Believing that what we feel, moment by moment It was caused by someone else. We actually say this: \"You bothered me!\" \"You spoiled my happiness!\" \"You did it to me!\" And we point our finger at others, Believing that others are the cause of our sorrows. Here's the news summary: Nobody wants to harm you. Nobody makes you feel these things. What do you think this happened? When did you feel frustrated about someone else? Did they come to you and inject you with frustration, With chemical elements for frustration? Did they use electrical signals for frustration, Pressure waves, sound waves? No, you did it! You created this thing inside yourself to respond to their bad behavior. So if you accept that you are the one doing this - They are not they, but you - This simple fact will keep you away from the place we call the \"victim\\'s site\" And you cross the threshold to reach \"possession\". This is the most important transition you will make during your life. To help you get there, First of all, you have to determine your place in the world of feelings. If I asked you to write down your current feelings within five minutes, You will have a list of things, Then we said well raise your hands how many of you have, We did a test of your total. Then the rate in a room like this will be between ten and twelve. There are 34,000 feelings you can go through. Most people live with ten or twelve. To help you arrive, I'll show you an app we designed To help people know where they are in the world of feelings. So we put all these feelings on a map, This map shows the axes: At the top axis of the sentiment There are those that make up somewhat more energy, Below is the quieter one. On the left side are the most positive. On the right, there is the most negative. You can see the division of the 20 most common feelings, As I speak to you now, you are somewhere in these divisions. You somewhere in the world feel one of these planets. And we can bring in the following 100 feelings, We can bring in 200 feelings and 1000 feelings. We designed this app as an attempt to bring together the 34,000 feelings. As an initial stage, we included only 2,000. You can enter one of the 64 existing orbits And you start wandering around To see your site relative to other feelings, Because if you don't know your site, you are lost. Then you will not be able to control your situation, This is very important for your health, comfort, and success And for anything you do. Whether you're an athlete, or a company leader, You will start controlling your emotional state For everything that happens for you. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where you are, So how do you control any of these? The answer is that you cannot. So the journey begins with knowing which planet you are on. This is designed to help you, and you can see in the upper corner there, Shows your approximate location in the universe, and determines time for you. Now we can zoom in close to looking at one of these 64 galaxies And look at a specific sun system. Which we go? Perhaps social. Let's see. Let's get closer to the social solar system And see what planets surround you. If you want to move from social to something else Then gradually moving around in a different part of the universe, You can see where you are. It is very important that you can monitor your site. You can write some notes. You're visiting the planet - I don't know - fame. I felt famous today. People come to me and give me various messages, and I feel famous. You can determine whether or not you feel popular Keep the review itinerary, You can share this with your companions. You can do this through Facebook, Twitter or Gmail. To see who is also in the social solar system Or even in the planet of fame, there is also there. And I can track, It also does with the audit itinerary for any place you find it. This is your starting point, beginning to understand What planet are you on, What are the planets closest to you and how you can start roaming around, You begin to have the ability to roam within that universe. First you have to learn to be able to walk around, This is designed to help you build a dictionary with your feelings. So as not to stop at a dozen feelings, Some people expressly: two! I feel \"disgust\" or \"satisfied\"; they only have these two feelings. You have to start building your own dictionary, What you will discover while building the dictionary Some feelings are like an antidote; some are more effective than others. So you can start wandering around, Next action: Whenever you start wandering around the universe, Really, whenever you reach a more positive planet, There is no right or wrong, but does this feeling really benefit you? Whenever you get a much positive planet, Can you stay there? This really requires you to do a separate maneuver, It is called mastery, When you actually get the feeling that affected you, It is a personal experience, below your true awareness, You are somewhat under his control, meaning he took over you! So if you get angry, if the anger goes in your system, If you are in anger planet, It enables you! You didn't get it! He got it! The way to control it is by embodying it. Like, \"Oh, that\\'s the feeling of anger.\" You remove it as if it were a personal experience, And you embody it. And if you can embody it, you can hold it tight. If you can do this with your positive feelings, You are able to move yourself to the positive side of the universe And stay there. So you never have to feel something that you don't want to feel. \"Misery\" is a choice you do not have to feel. But if you don't control him, Who will? The answer is always someone outside. And so I encourage you, If you want to transform in your life forever Because in the end, feelings predict your health, It predicts your performance, comfort, and sense of accomplishment. It determines your ability to make effective decisions, Feelings fuel all of that, motivation and more. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about it but you control it, It is more like an unexpected lottery. If you go out today, ask yourself one question: What planet am I? And what planet would I be like? And start working on the transition to the planet you want Instead of letting life push you anywhere. Imagine a world in which we are all Able to be on the planet we want, Or we can walk around that solar system Or those orbits that we want to try. Imagine a world You can go to a bar and talk to an attractive person, Without drinking a pint of Dutch courage Before you can go there. Imagine that you can do it yourself. Imagine a world You don't have to feel anxious during the exam or have a job interview, You will not feel fear as you ascend the stage. Imagine a world where your kids are being bullied, They are not afraid or do not care about bullying. If you can control your feelings, you can completely change your life. That is why I am most supportive To ask what planet you are on, And you start putting yourselves in the universe, Somewhere in the universe you really want to live. Thank you very much! (clap)", "lAC8IEJDxCg": "my name is Liza Shaw I'm a marriage and family therapist and I have been working in the passion of my life for the last 15 20 years I'd say the last 10 years what I've been doing is discovering my expertise and it surprised me when I discovered it because what I like to do probably most people when I tell them they kind of go ooh that sounds like it'd be hard and messy what I do is what I specialize in is working with people who are on the edge of breakdown and in particular couples families on the edge of breakdown and what I love about that of course is not the breakdown but it's what comes after of course which is the breakthrough and it is what I get up every day to do I literally am one of those people who are lucky to wake up every morning and go I can't wait to get to work so I just am super blessed and I'm excited to share this passion with you guys today I want to start it's called marriage 2.0 but I want to make an acknowledgement that anyone in a lifelong committed relationship will be able to relate to the ideas here today and I also want to start with an acknowledgement so just think about people you know in your life who are in a lifelong committed relationship and maybe you're in one or maybe you want to be in one just think about them who do you know how many people can you count that you know are in an amazing thriving awesome passionate excited to wake up every morning relationship how many role models do we have in our culture of people who've been together for a long period of time and are still totally into it it's kind of small right so we don't we don't have a lot of that around we have a whole lot more of the drama and the upsets and the breakdowns don't we that's what we see a lot of of course that's what sells in the media and it becomes what we think is normal I've come up with my own kind of simple idea for why and I'm not sure if this is really why or not it's just my theory the old model of marriage has been around for a really long time okay it's been around for several thousands of years people lived a whole lot shorter when marriage was first invented and lifelong marriage was created I would say then as about a 10 to 30-year proposition at the most essentially if someone was married at age 15 and lived to be about 35 years old then this lifelong relationship would only be about 20 years long well the idea is that the platform if you will of marriage and what it's made up of and how it's evolved over time I would say works for about between 10 and 30 years this is what I see in my practice my clients come in I ask them you know when they come in and I've already found out that they're here to work on their relationship which is breaking down and they're not sure if they're going to be able to make it and they want to work on it I find that overwhelmingly people have been together from between like 10 and 30 years now there's the outliers but this is just in general what I've discovered and I believe this is this is really not a problem I'm not saying like this is wrong I'm saying it's a design flaw it's a it's it's that we as a species we've developed and we've evolved physically but socially we're a little bit behind and so it's time for us to upgrade you know like until we have people list cars we actually do have to teach people how to drive but we don't do that much real overt teaching about how to have relationships really be awesome and really really thrive and then we don't see it either around us so we're all it's like a crapshoot it's really feels quite dangerous sometimes people don't want to get married or don't want to make lifetime commitments because of this so at the point of breakdown what occurs is of course couples can make some choices they can stay married but give up on that fulfilment and the joy and all the things that they committed to when they made that commitment they can divorce and remarry of course and those same ideas could be what what drives the next relationship which will eventually break down they can divorce and they can give up on relationships altogether or they can upgrade their relationship today what I'm going to do is deconstruct the ideas of marriage I'm going to deconstruct and sort of look at the platform that we kind of take for granted and often don't even realize it's sort of like the background of relationships and I'm going to offer some new ideas in their place and these ideas have worked with literally probably at this point hundreds of couples so let's look at our first old idea people who love each other shouldn't hurt each other right sound pretty clear anybody here like to be hurt you don't have to actually admit that but we don't generally want to be hurt right especially by the people who love us the most and the people we love the most and yet and you hear that ironic saying people say oh the people you know it's so crazy that I hurt the people I'm closest to it's not crazy actually it's actually it makes perfect sense so if we operate on an assumption that hurt is bad for marriage that it's bad it means something bad about the relationship then your relationship will only be able to last as long as you can withstand pain and disappointment right so this is this would be like not teaching someone how to drive on ice just saying to them hey here's how to drive talk to that now ice is bad so don't drive on it well okay we can try to avoid it but what happens when we're on it right we don't have any preparation the new model says hurt is inevitable in fact the new model says that the closer we are to someone the more clearly they're going to hurt us because they're more important to us than others so think about like um you're in traffic and some guy flips you the bird right now for the most part you're going to be annoyed or you might you know get a flash of adrenaline and give it back to him for a second but 20 minutes later you're probably not going to be thinking about that guy I hope you're not that guy's not that important to you but if you're in the middle of an argument with your or your significant other and who you love desperately love this person and they flip you the bird you get a little more irritated look you know you really might get really angry and it hurts it hurts a lot more so culturally what this new model idea of assuming hurt is inevitable will do is it also gives you the opportunity as a culture it gives all of us an opportunity to actually value the opportunity in being heard and actually prepare for being hurt assuming it's going to happen so why don't we actually prepare why don't actually you know our schools could actually prepare children for dealing with being hurt and not just tell them to be quiet or don't be a tattle-tale send them to the principal's office if they went and hurt somebody take a look at another old idea a happy marriage requires compromise right I can't really see anybody out there but I have a feeling some of you are nodding as your father told you this your stepdad your mom on your wedding night maybe well guess what how many of you guys have felt great when you walked away from a compromise how many of you been like man that was so awesome that neither of us got what we really wanted that was great yeah compromise is not going to make a thriving experience for either person or anyone involved compromise does not feel empowering at all and I'm saying stop trying to compromise right it has anybody ever told you that before don't compromise well maybe you know and simply don't sell out in a marriage I am Telling You that it's bad for your marriage to compromise because the best that you can get when you're compromising is turn-taking okay you keep score I gave in today tomorrow's my turn and then you wait for it and then when you don't get it you're pissed off and when you're mad what is your spouse get from you resentment and is my resentment a gift to my spouse of course not I my husband and I are doing our best and it's an imperfect art to raise the kids our children in the art of not compromising by something that this new idea is based on creating solutions together with our partner never ever feels like a compromise okay so what I mean by that is example my children want to watch TV they want to each watch two different shows the rule is agreement not disagreement okay so if they want to watch TV the rule is find what you both want to watch it's going to take a little bit longer because nine times out of 10 what each of you first wanted to watch was not the thing you're going to end up watching but don't here compromise in this there is one thing both of you will actually feel really good about if you will look for it so you guys get what I'm saying this is not about saying Oh fine we'll do it your way this time that's the old model speaking of the old model my partner and I will fulfill all of each other's needs and make each other happy literally every day in my practice this one comes up every single day of course what this means is it's the experience of meeting the other person to fulfill you right now I just got a question for you like why would I put the power of fulfillment somewhere outside of me why would I actually do that we've all been raised pretty much to think this way but it's castles a little bit insane actually I actually want my satisfaction of my fulfilment to be under my control if I have the choice right so in theirs in win-win which is kind of the new model paradigm it's a win-win situation we're going to be looking for we would actually be interested in contributing to the other person contribution this is I would say one of the most challenging ideas that I it kind of turns clients heads inside-out when I start to talk about it with them at first I want you guys to hang with me on it a little bit okay because some client most of the people who walk in my office unhappy say to me but I give all the time I'm always giving and giving and giving and I never get and I when is when's it going to be a meantime what am I going to be able to get something I used to say this to guys I'm not like immune to any of this there's just the old model and the new model if they can exist like instantaneously I can be in the space of the old model and then I could be in the space of the new model so the old model says I gave before I gave before it's my turn right turn taking it comes out of resentment Who am I concerned about somebody say it me and that's fundamentally self-centered selfish right and I got some news for you guys being self-centered and selfish feels horrible it actually feels really bad and when I am contributing out of my true and authentic love for my spouse it feels freakin amazing it feels awesome when I'm selfless when I'm contributing what I really am contributing I'm not talking about you know the doing for so that I get something because that's not a gift remember we said resentment is not a gift right so sharing something with somebody especially in times when I am not really wanting to but there's a willingness to there's a there's a desire I actually feel so lit up when I do something for my spouse that I didn't really want to do but I got the pleasure in the moment of doing it there is absolutely nothing left I need in that moment so if any of you are out there kind of going what is she talking about that I want to say that's very exciting for you because you've got an opportunity you'd never even knew existed actually there's like a new path opening right now for you to experience true and authentic happiness if any of you into this room or watching the video have any sort of unfulfillment what I challenge you to do is be selfless in you relationship and I don't mean selfless like like put yourself down see if I don't need to have my needs fulfilled by my spouse then I come to the relationship contributing something I actually have something to contribute not just need need is not a gift and plus all my needs are met I mean one of the other speakers was talking and saying about you know like if you just get present right now you realize all your needs are met that's pretty awesome here's another one never go to bed angry anybody raise your hand if you've had somebody tell you this right it's really important for marriage don't go to bed angry yeah don't raise your hand if you've given that advice just kind of keep that one to yourself okay I'm just teasing I've probably given that advice too and it's okay if you even believe it still today I just want you to consider something else  I don't just and I'm not trying to be smart I mean you might find that that could be fun if you're angry because some people like that but I'm actually what I'm really talking about is the lizard you have in your brain did you guys know that you had a lizard in your brain it's kind of a vernacular in the therapy world that we refer to our brain as the lizard brain well there's a part of our brain that's lizard brain it sorts the back by the spinal cord it's called the amygdala it's real small about the size of the top of my thumb and that thing controls fight-or-flight response and have you guys ever had that experience where you'll like have a massive argument and then two three days later you have absolutely no idea what it was about you're like talking to your friend you're like man God we had a huge blow-up really what was it about I can't really I don't I don't know I don't really remember right that's because the lizard brain was engaged so the lizard brain gives you two options you can run away or you can fight to win right or run away because you don't want to lose those are the only two options when you are trying to solve a problem when you are upset you already have lost okay because you are either going to fight with this person you're saying you want a relationship with and you want it to be awesome and thriving or you're going to run away from it you're in withdraw now there are those in here who have one or the other as they're kind of dominant thing the people in here who are the with drawers are going to right now you're probably hearing from the old model you're hearing oh good I get to go to bed and I don't have to deal with the problem yes I get to withdraw that's not what I'm saying what I'm actually saying is that when your limbic system is engaged it is no gift to your spouse your partner you're not contributing anything but your anger or your upset what are you contributing that's the question in your relationships so go to bed calm down see the back of the brain and the front of the brain cannot be engaged at the same time front of the brains where all the creativity comes from all the ability to oblem solve that math guy that we saw in the video that guy's frontal prefrontal cortex is lighting up all over the place that's where thinking out of the box comes from that's where solving our problems comes from okay we're going to step this up it takes two to make a marriage work no it doesn't and I'll tell you why because it takes two to change is a cool theory but what it really is if we really get honest is it takes you to change you the other person you not me because I need my needs met by you and you're not doing it so the infinity symbols actually imagine yourself on one side your partners on the other their behavior contributes in your mind to what you think you're doing that helps the situation actually makes it worse what I suggest to you is it takes one one and you're it you like the person sitting in your seat right now listening to me you're the one and the only one that needs to do anything to stand for an amazing relationship I want to tell you real quickly that the reason I love this so much is because ten years ago my marriage almost failed and I ended up in a therapists office who was able to help my husband and me have the most awesome absolutely fulfilling life-changing experience for our kids and for ourselves and I want that for you too so I wish you the best of amazing thriving relationships and thank you so much for having me today  you", "rStsx8SGsPc": "arabiska", "Lp7E973zozc": "Hello! Hi San Francisco! TEDx- Oh my God, the light is strong! Hello all! how are you? (Audience cheering) Okay ?! My God! OK... My name is Mel Robins, and for the past seventeen years, I did nothing but help people get what they wanted. without any reason! My husband is here. Well, I did this in the courtroom, in the meeting room and in the bedroom, In a living room strangers, and what room do you want me to be in, If you are there, I will help you get whatever you want, in any way. For the past three years - I have hosted a joint radio program. Five days a week, I broadcast live in 40 cities And I talk to men and women across America who feel stuck in trouble. Did you know that a third of Americans are dissatisfied with their lives today? What is equal to one hundred million people! This is crazy! I experienced that in my new program, Which is considered insane, this program is called \"relatives in marriage\". I moved in with families across America - (Laughter) I think you got the picture! - Those suffering from strained relationships with their in-laws. We do it in the same house, I verbally assassinate them all, We open Pandora's Box, Have people stop arguing about local cakes Who will host the Thanksgiving dinner, I get them to talk about real things. And this is what I want to talk about with you. I am here to help you. I will tell you everything I know in less than 18 minutes. What I know about getting what you want. So now I would like you to take a few seconds And think about what you want. You are! I just want you to think of yourself! Damn Simon and the term \"we.\" It's all about me now! (Laughter) (Applause) Sorry, Simon. what do you want? And herein lies the matter. I don't want it to look good in the eyes of others. Being healthy will not make your bottom need a walking device. Get rid of your big men boobs to be able to relate to one of them. This became a motivation. (Laughter) So, I want to know: What do you want? Do you want to lose some weight? Do you want to triple your income? Do you want to start a non-profit organization? Do you want to find the love of your life? what do you want? Get it, here. You know what it is, do not analyze it much, just choose something. This is part of the problem. You will not make a choice. So we'll talk about how you got what you wanted. Frankly, it is simple to get what you want. But note that I did not say it was easy. It's very simple. In fact, if you think about it, We are experiencing the most beautiful moments in our lives. So the ideas that we hold in our minds, whatever they are, You want to eat healthy food to treat diabetes, You want to know how to care for and care for the elderly, Creating a new disability care center, You want to move to Africa and build schools there ... guess what? You can head to a bookstore - right away! And purchase at least ten books of certified experts Turns to how you do it. You can search for it in Google. And you can find at least I don't know exactly - maybe a thousand blogs Step by step documentation, transformation steps That someone else is already following. You can find anyone on the Internet and are now chasing them! (Laughter) You can follow in their footsteps - just rely on the science of drafting. Watch what everyone is doing and follow carefully, because someone is already doing it! So why don't you have what you want? When you have the information you need, You have the relationships and connections that you need, There are probably free tools on the Internet that allow you to create a business, Or join a group or do whatever you want ?! We can express it in one word: Damn. Stop it, know what I'm talking about? This bomb is all around us! You always hear it! I really don't understand the attractiveness of this word. What I mean is that you don't look smart when you say it. In fact, do not express your true feelings. It is a cheap trick to turn to. You know, of course, that I'm talking about the word \"fine.\" \"how are you?\" \"Oh, I'm fine.\" Oh really? Are you like this? You wander around and carry your extra weight of about 20 kg, are you okay? Feel that roommate is with your wife, are you okay? You haven't had sex in the past seven months, are you okay? Oh really?! I do not think so! However, this is the deal that tells you you're okay: He's actually a genius. Because if you feel fine, you will not be forced to do anything about it. But when you think of this word \"fine\", it makes me feel very angry. We are holding a lecture about being alive Will you describe our experience of being alive as \u201cokay\u201d ?! What a weak and weak word! If you are in poor condition, say you are! If you feel in amazing shape, let us know! Tell the Truth! This does not only apply to social behavior: \"Oh, I don't want to burden you with the fact that I hate my life,\" Or \"I'm in very good condition! But I don't want to bother you.\" The most important issue-- The main issue with the term \"okay\" is that you say it to yourself. The thing you want, I guarantee you, You convince yourself that you are OK without realizing it. For this reason, do not motivate yourself. They are parts of our lives that we have surrendered to. Where i said, \"Oh, I'm fine. My mom will never change, So I can never have this conversation. \" \"I'm fine. We have to wait for the children to complete their higher studies before divorce, So we will use separate bedrooms. \" \"I'm fine. I lost my job, and I could barely afford to pay the bills, But in any case - it is difficult to get a job. One of the reasons why I feel so disturbed is this word. According to scientists \u2019calculations - Oh yeah, I got off! (Laughter) Scientists have performed a number of calculations Possibilities For your being She was born. It is true. They crushed these numbers. See you up there. They crushed the numbers centered around you - Yes, you stand there, would you like to sit down for this? They crushed numbers related to your birth. And they took into account all wars, Natural disasters, dinosaurs, And everything else. And do we realize that the odds, the odds of being, Yes, here, put the computer aside, Stand up for me, Doug! (Laughter) Chances are Doug is here, turn around and say hello to everyone. Possibilities for Doug's birth The moment he was born, For your parents, with the DNA structure you own, It's one of 400 trillion! Isn't this amazing? Doug: Take it lucky! Miles: Yes: I'm not okay. You are gorgeous! You have ideas that motivate you to change your lifestyle for a reason, and not to torture yourself. Thank you, thank you Doug. (clap) Christine was right when she said that each of you can take the stage. Because each of you - we all belong to this category. One of 400 trillion. You have ideas all day that can change your life, It can change the world, it can change the way you feel, What do you do with them? nothing! (Grunts) I hope I won't show you that. (Laughter) You did not pay for it. (Laughter) And all I want from you is to think for a minute, because all we have - I like to use the metaphor and the \"internal snooze button\". She has these amazing ideas flowing and appearing. You were watching people all day And I guarantee you, it's like ping-pong-bam-bam-bam balls And every time you get an idea, what are you missing? - Take a nap! What was your first decision this morning? I bet it was about getting back to bed. \"Yes, the first decision today, and I'm one of 400 billion, I will go back to sleep. \" I understand! Your bed is comfortable! It's soft, it's warm! If you\u2019re lucky, a person next to you may be next to you, Or in my case, I have my husband, two children and maybe a dog. And the reason behind this first decision I made today, The alarm button to take a nap, returns to it In which area of \u200b\u200byour life would you like to change, Anyone - There is one truth you need to know. that is the true: You will never feel like doing this. Start. Nobody is coming, there is no motive, You will never feel like doing this Scientists call it activation and activation energy. This is what they call the required force Modular change in everything you do Adopting the autopilot to do something new. So do this test tomorrow. You think you are beautiful, I know, you are in TED. (Laughter) Try this. Tomorrow morning, set the alarm hour 30 minutes before your waking up. And when the alarm rings, take your sheet and cover, Throw it away, stop and start your day. No nap, no delay, Not that you say \"I will wait here for five seconds because Mile is not here.\" - Do it. The reason I want you to do this is because you will be face to face With physical, I mean physical strength Required to change your behavior. Do you think someone needs to lose weight May he feel he needs a diet? Of course not! Do you think they would like to eat boiled chicken and peas Instead of eating a croissant? I do not think so! It is the activation energy Required to keep your back from the computer chair and head to the front door, To go for a walk that you said you would take, It is the same amount of force that you need To force yourself to leave the warm bed and enter a cold room. Interesting in being an adult Is when you are eighteen, Nobody tells you that your task will now be to take care of yourself and raise it. With the term \"raising yourself\" I mean, your job is to get yourself to make trivia that you don't want to do, In order for you to become everything you want and what you are supposed to be. You are very busy waiting to be what you want. And never will be! My son doesn't want to stop playing his electronic game. So this is my job! Stop using this damned electronic game! Kendall, clean up Barbie dolls! Arrange them If you are going to organize a nudity party in the bathroom, clean the place at least! (Laughter) My God, chew food and your mouth is closed! We are not in the fold, to shout out loud! Okay, dinner is approaching, move away from the pantry. Cooley, as a kid, Your parents force you to do something that you don't want to do. Because you never want to. Not now, not after a while, and never! Even when you do a good thing, You'll find that there is something else new that you don't want to do. Then you will get upset and bored and bored, \"I hate this job, bored.\" But will you look for a new one? No! You will be fooled about that thing. It's very simple, getting what you want is simple. But it is not easy. You must push yourself to do so. I mean power. And the reason I stand for the term \"strength\" - When Rose took the stage and talked about chasing passion, And she had a picture of the brain lobes - I look at the brain in the same way. I describe a side of your brain as an autopilot The second as an emergency brake. These are your two speeds: autopilot and emergency brakes. And guess what part your brain prefers: autopilot. You have experience when it comes to driving to your business and when you get there She asked, \"Oh my God, I don't remember driving here.\" (Laughter) You are not drunk! This is what your brain looks like in autopilot mode. It only works at this level. The problem is in your mind that at any time Do anything different from your regular routine, Guess what your brain is doing - it uses emergency brakes! This reaction is used with anything. Anything! Go towards the kitchen and see Everyone would have left breakfast dishes to be washed. And repeat for the hundredth time, \"I will kill them all. Actually I'm going to leave her here and get them to do it. \" But this is not your daily routine, is it? So choose your mind: emergency brakes! It returns directly to the autopilot. \"I will do it and feel disturbed and therefore we will not have sex. That's what I'm going to do. \"(Laughter) (Applause) So when you say \"strength\", Anything you do to take a break from your daily routine will require strength. And if you think about your life, It's kind of funny because we are kids and then we become adults, And we spend a lot of time trying to push our lives forward, Toward a kind of stable routine, And then we grow up with a feeling bored of it! You wake up at the same time every day, you eat almost the same breakfast You drive towards your work on the same road, you get to work and look busy, Avoid making calls, making updates to Facebook, You attend a meeting and you mess around all the time, Go back and write Facebook updates, make an outline of the evening, You look more busy, go the same way to go home, You generally have the same dinner or a variety of it, You see the same media scenes, Then you head to your bed and repeat the same thing every time! No wonder you are bored and lose your mind! Routine kills and eliminates you. I have a theory about why people feel stuck in their lives. Most of you have undergone basic psychology lessons, And you exposed to Abraham Maslow's \"hierarchy of needs\"? Well, your body looks great. Because you have these basic needs. Your body looks like a radio transmitter. If you need food, how do you feel? If you need to drink water, how do you feel? If you need sex, how do you feel? And I think when you feel stuck or unhappy with your life, I think it is a signal. It is not a sign that your life is destroyed. Signal to let you know that one of your most basic needs is not provided. Your need to explore. Everything about your life, and about your body, is growing! Your body cells, hair and nails regenerate, Everything grows all your life. Your soul needs to be explored and to grow. The only way you'll be able to achieve this is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable. Force yourself out of the ordinary, To cross the border, thank you. If you keep your thoughts, you are behind enemy lines. This is not talked, okay? It is not such! In fact, if you put on speakers and we broadcast what you say to yourself, We'd like to give you my corporate personality. (Laughter) You will not want to go out with people talking to you In the same way that you speak to yourself. So go beyond your limits! Your feelings! Your feelings destroy you! I don't care how you feel! What I care about is what you want! And if you listen to your feelings, When it comes to what you want - you won't get it. Because you never feel that you want it. You must go beyond your comfort zone. It's not about facing risks, Rather, it is about leaving the comfort zone. These are the first three seconds when you force yourself to leave the bed a bit like. But as soon as you leave it feels great. It's like the first three minutes when you're sitting here in this runway, Someone turns to you, saying, \"Get up and come dance.\" And you think about saying, \"Oh, I have to do it,\" And then it retracts. That experience when you had the motivation to do so Hence the activation energy was not used Required to force and motivate yourself, The emergency brake pulls out - \"I'm sitting here. I'm not going up there with these crazy people, I don't like to dance. \" What happened with me was that I went up here, crashed into Brachel, Then we started talking and after a while she wrote a tweet on Twitter. And we are friends and suddenly! Get out. There is where the magic lies. Here there is one of 400 trillion. So all I do - oh, well, this is the last part. Sorry. There is another thing that you can use, called a five-second rule. Your mind can analyze facial expressions in 33 milliliters. He can move very quickly. Another thing that he does quickly That if there is a motivation that motivates you and motivates you, If you don\u2019t take any action within five seconds, It pulls the emergency brake and kills the idea. kill her! If you have the drive to get up and dance while the band is playing, If you are not leaving your place within five seconds, It will pull the emergency brake. If you have a motive for this, Today you will find inspiration in someone\u2019s conversation, And when you don't have the initiative to take action in five seconds, Write a note, send a text message to yourself. To do anything to get him to come together with this idea, You will pull the emergency brake and kill the idea. It does not enable your problem with the idea, but your problem is that you do nothing practical. She kills her. This is not my fault. This is not anyone's fault. Do this to yourself. Stop it! I count on you. One of 400 trillion. There are things that you have to do. It will not happen like this in your mind. So today I want you to practice this. When we go to a party, and thank God that it will be soon, Because I think we can drink, I want you to practice on the five-second rule. You see someone and you think you have a motive, Does it sound interesting? Head there! I got inspiration from someone and you have a request! Ask for it. This is why you are here! Try it out, and I think you will be shocked by what's going on. And one more thing after, I want you to know that everything I do, Whether it is a radio or television program Or a book I wrote or a column in a newspaper, All of this is for you! And if there is anything I can do, If I could do anything to get you to do the things you don't want, So you can get what you want, I'm gonna do it. But you need to take the first step, you need to open your mouth, And you need to ask for it. Did you get that? this is good. Do it. (clap) Thank you, thank you, yes! Please stand up! You got the motivation to do that, stand up! thank you!", "pxBQLFLei70": "thank you very much thank you well Thank You president powers Provost fenves Dean's members of the faculty family and friends and most importantly the class of 2014 it is it is indeed an honor for me to be here tonight it's been almost 37 years to the day that I graduated from UT I remember a lot of things about that day I remember I had a throbbing headache from a party the night before I remember I had a serious girlfriend who I later married that's important to remember by the way and I remember I was getting commissioned in the Navy that day but of all the things I remember I don't have a clue who the commencement speaker was and I certainly don't remember anything they said so acknowledging that fact if I can't make this commencement speech memorable I won't least try to make it short so the university slogan is what starts here changes the world well I've got to admit I kind of like it what starts here changes the world tonight there are almost 8,000 students there more than 8,000 students graduated from UT so that great paragon of analytical rigor ask.com says that the average American will meet 10,000 people in their lifetime 10,000 people that's a lot of folks but if every one of you change the lives of just 10 people and each one of those people change the lives of another 10 people and another 10 then in five generations 125 years the class of 2014 will have changed the lives of 800 million people 800 million people think about it over twice the population of the United States go one more generation and you can change the entire population of the world eight billion people if you think it's hard to change the lives of ten people change their lives forever you're wrong I saw it happen everyday in Iraq and Afghanistan a young army officer makes a decision to go left instead of right down a road in Baghdad and the ten soldiers with him are saved from a close-in ambush in Tenderheart province Afghanistan a noncommissioned officer from the Female Engagement Team senses that something isn't right and directs the infantry platoon away from a 500-pound I Edie saving the lives of a dozen soldiers but if you think about it not only were those soldiers say by the decisions of one person but their children were saved and their children's children generations were saved by one decision one person but changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it so what starts here can indeed change the world but the question is what will the world look like after you change it well I'm confident that it will look much much better but if you'll humor this old sailor for just a moment I have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better world and while these lessons were learned during my time in the military I can assure you that it matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform it matters not your gender your ethnic or religious background your orientation or your social status our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all I've been a Navy SEAL for 36 years but it all began when I left UT for basic SEAL training in Coronado California basic SEAL training is six months a long torturous runs in the soft sand midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego obstacle courses unending calisthenics days without sleep and always being cold wet and miserable it is six months of being constantly harassed by professionally trained warriors who seek to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL but the training also seeks to find those students who can lead in an environment of constant stress chaos failure and hardships to me basic SEAL training was a lifetime of challenges crammed into six months so here the 10 lessons I learned from basic SEAL training that hopefully will be a value to you as you move forward in life every morning in SEAL training my instructors who at the time were all Vietnam veterans would show up in my barracks room and the first thing they do is inspect my bed if you did it right the corners would be square the covers would be pulled tight the pillows centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack it was a simple task mundane at best but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection it seemed a little ridiculous at the time particularly in light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors tough battle-hardened seals but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over if you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another and by the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into mini task completed making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter if you can't do the little things right you'll never be able to do the big things right and if by chance you have a miserable day you will come home to a bed that is made that you made and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better so if you want to change the world start off by making your bed during SEAL training the students during training the students are all broken down into boat crews each crew is seven students three on each side of a small rubber boat and one Coxon to help guide the dinghy every day your boat crew forms up on the beach and is instructed to get through the surf zone and paddle several miles down the coast in the winter the surf off San Diego can get to be eight to ten feet high and it is exceedingly difficult to paddle hook through the plunging surf unless everyone digs in every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke count of the Coxon everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously dumped back on the beach for the boat to make it to its destination everyone must paddle you can't change the world alone you will need some help and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends colleagues the good will of strangers and a strong oxen to guide you if you want to change the world find someone to help you paddle over a few weeks of difficult training my SEAL class which started with 150 men was down to just 42 there were now six boat crews of seven men each I was in the boat with the tall guys but the best boat crew we had was made up of little guys the Munchkin crew we called him no one was over five foot five the Munchkin boat crew had one American Indian one African American one Polish American one Greek American one Italian American and two tough kids from the Midwest they out paddled out ran and out swam all the other boat crews the big men and the other boat crews will always make good-natured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim but somehow these little guys from every corner of the nation in the world always have the last laugh sewing faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us SEAL training was a great equalizer nothing mattered but your will to succeed not your color not your ethnic background not your education not your social status if you want to change the world measure a person by the size of their heart not by the size of their flippers several times a week the instructors would line up the class and do a uniform inspection it was exceptionally thorough your hat had to be perfectly starched your uniform immaculately pressed your belt buckle shiny and void of any smudges but it seemed that no matter how much effort you put into starting your hat or pressing your uniform or polishing your belt buckle it just wasn't good enough the instructors would find something wrong for failing the uniform inspection the student had to run fully clothed into the surf zone then wet from head to toe roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand the effect was known as a sugar cookie you stayed in the uniform the rest of the day cold wet and Sandy there were many a student who just couldn't accept the fact that all their efforts were in vain that no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right it went unappreciated those students didn't make it through training those students didn't understand the purpose of the drill you were never going to succeed you were never going to have a perfect uniform the instructors weren't going to allow it sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform you still end up as a sugar cookie it's just the way life is sometimes if you want to change the world did over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward every day during training you were challenged with multiple physical events long runs long swims obstacle courses hours of calisthenics something designed to test your mettle every event had standards times you had to meet if you fail to meet those times those standards your name was posted on a list and at the end of the day those on the list were invited to circus a circus was two hours of additional calisthenics designed to wear you down to break your spirit to force you to quit no one wanted a circus a circus myth that for that day you didn't measure up a circus meant more fatigue and more fatigue meant that the following day would be more difficult and more circuses were likely but at some time during seal training everyone everyone made the circus list but an interesting an interesting thing happened to those who were constantly on the list over time those students who did two hours of extra calisthenics gets stronger and stronger the pain of the circuses built inner strength and physical resiliency life is filled with circuses you will fail you will likely fail often it will be painful it will be discouraging at times it will test you to your very core but if you don't if you want to change the world don't be afraid of the circuses at least twice a week the trainees were required to run the obstacle course the obstacle course contained 25 obstacles including the 10-foot wall a 30-foot cargo net a barbed wire crawl to name a few but the most challenging obstacle was the slide for life it had a three level 30-foot tower at one end and a one level Tower at the other in between was a 200-foot long rope you had to climb the three tiered tower and once at the top you grabbed the rope swung underneath the rope and pulled yourself hand over hand until you got to the other end the record for the obstacle course had stood for years from my class began in 1977 the record seemed unbeatable until one day a student decided to go down the slide for life headfirst instead of swinging his body underneath the rope and inching his way down he bravely mounted the top of the rope and thrust himself forward it was a dangerous move seemingly foolish and fraught with risk failure could be an injury and being dropped from the course without hesitation the students slid down the Rope perilously fast instead of several minutes it only took him half that time and by the end of the course yeah broken the record if you want to change the world sometimes you have to slide down the obstacles headfirst during the land warfare phase of training the students are flown out to San Clemente Island which lies off the coast of San Diego the waters off San Clemente are a breeding ground for the great white sharks to pass seal training they're a series of long swims that must be completed one is the night swim before the swim the instructors joyfully brief the students on all the species of sharks that inhabit the waters off San Clemente they assure you however that no student has ever been eaten by a shark at least not that they can remember but you were also taught that if a shark begins to circle your position stand your ground do not swim away do not act afraid and if the shark hungry for a midnight snack darts towards you then summons up all your strength and punch him in the snout and you will turn and swim away there are a lot of sharks in the world if you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them so if you want to change the world don't back down from the sharks as Navy SEALs one of our jobs is to conduct underwater attacks against enemy shipping we practice this technique extensively during training the ship attack mission is where a pair of SEAL divers is dropped off outside an enemy harbor and then swims well over two miles underwater using nothing but a depth gauge and a compass to get to the target during the entire swim even well below the surface there is some light that comes through it is comforting to know that there is open water above you but as you approach the ship which is tied to appear the light begins to fade the steel structure of the ship blocks the moonlight it blocks the surrounding streetlamps it blocks all ambient light to be successful in your mission you have to swim under the ship and find the keel the centerline the deepest part of the ship this is your objective but the keel is also the darkest part of the ship where you cannot see your hand in front of your face where the noise from the ship's machinery is deafening and where it gets to be easily disoriented and you can fail every seal knows that under the keel at that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm when you must be calm when you must be composed when all your tactical skills your physical power and your inner strength must be brought to bear if you want to change the world you must be your very best in the darkest moments the ninth week of training is referred to as hell week it is six days of no sleep constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the mud flats the mud flats are an area between San Diego and Tijuana where the water runs off and creates the Tijuana sloughs a swampy patch of terrain where the mud will engulf you it is on Wednesday of hell week that's a paddle down in the mud flats and spend the next 15 hours trying to survive this freezing cold the howling wind and the incessant pressure to quit from the instructors as the Sun began to set that Wednesday evening my training class having committed some egregious infraction of the rules was ordered into the mud the mud consumed each man till there was nothing visible but our heads the instructors told us we could leave the mud if only five men would quit only five men just five men and we could get out of the oppressive cold looking around the mud flat it was apparent that some students were about to give up it was still over eight hours till the Sun came up eight more hours of bone-chilling cold a chattering teeth and shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything and then one voice began to echo through the night one voice raised in song the song was terribly out of tune but sung with great enthusiasm one voice became two and two became three and before long everyone in the class was singing the instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singing but the singing persisted and somehow the mud seemed a little warmer and the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away if I have learned anything in my time traveling the world it is the power of hope the power of one person a Washington a Lincoln King Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan Malala one person can change the world by giving people hope so if you want to change the world start singing when you're up to your neck in mud finally a seal training there's a bell a brass Bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see all you have to do quit all you have to do to quit is ring the bell ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o'clock ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course the PT and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training all you have to do is ring the bell to get out if you want to change the world don't ever ever ring the bell to the class of 2014 you are moments away from graduating moments away from beginning your journey through life moments away from starting to change the world for the better it will not be easy but you are the class of 2014 the class that can affect the lives of 800 million people in the next century start each day with a task completed find someone to help you through life respect everyone know that life is not fair and that you will fail often but if you take some risks step up on the time through the toughest faced down the bullies lift up the downtrodden and never ever give up if you do these things the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we today and what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better thank you very much clucking horns", "_tMzPIdEJFg": "today I'm gonna get you all right we bout to do some bulking on a budget yes pulling up at Walmart so we're gonna get everything from Walmart everybody have a Walmart in their area there's a lot more like every corner so that's we're gonna get

sure you choose as lean as possible this is 80 to 90 I like to go with as lean as possible this is 93 percent lean setback so I think that's about as fine we're going to add everything up I got my calculator out so we'll be keeping track of that forget this piece right here starting with big portions our budget 17:42 so I'm actually gonna be fine for a month I spend $80 for the entire month break that down that's $20 a week but you guys took bulk on a budget next up on proteins or exacts in order to be some chicken so grab some chicken feet it's a good price it's only two thousand five cents of site wax gonna grab some chicken breast everybody needs some good chicken breast in their diet of NAS 1217 here  our next source of protein is going to be eggs that's what I eat almost every morning great source of protein for the morning time you'll need too many of them but they got everything you need and by the way we're gonna be shopping for breakfast lunch as well as dinner eighty dollars a month on a bulking diet is $20 a week just go ahead get a big card there's only $7 for 60 eggs of course I gotta open things on correct voila the top is good to go check the polish bottles

morning so make sure you grab your son so you guys can do what you want you can actually grab you one of these big containers right here I like to keep it simple I grab apples and cinnamon this is my favorite oatmeal to eat every morning so punch and I'm actually grab two packs which allows me  alright now we're gonna go actually grab some rice a lot of rice for lunch and dinner so I'm going to

here friend you could grab whatever you want I actually don't see many other friends over here but I'm getting some black beans make it probably about 3 4 cans at ease for the month so those are two dollars and eight cents each so we're gonna add more at 57 dollars we're still doing amazing so next up I'm gonna grab some vegetables you can choose whatever vegetables you want to grab I personally like to use broccoli a lot of people don't like broccoli but I'm not really picky when it comes to vegetables and food in general I want to grab whatever works best for me it's the biggest bag I'm

a month or twenty dollars for a week penis is a good option for some snacks that that's what you choose to eat if you don't have a problem with peanuts go ahead and eat that but just be careful what kind of snacks you choose in between your meals you definitely want to stay away from sugary drinks like soda you don't need it but speaking about liquids make sure you're drinking enough water I'm

gonna have to catch y'all later you", "Y75Y85FSljs": "[Music]  these rogue implements certainly have an artistic quality to them but if you've ever used a bar like this it is much different than a barbell that you would find in an everyday gym yes this barbell is made specifically for the deadlift it's longer it's about nine feet long and this let this length also means that there's more flex in the barbell and that that proposes that the strongman can actually lift more weight  but actually also they have controlled that that flex in the barbell and overcoming that weight and the end with their brute strength after appearance n' did that last year as he lifted 1041 how to set the record on this deadlift bar there are five men who have lifted more than a thousand pounds and four of them are here in this field Brian Shaw Gerry Pritchett jean-francois korone and half Thor bjornsen the deadlift is the opening event the first of five events that will be contested here at the Arnold strongman classic each athlete will have three attempts and there is a little bit of a chess match that goes into this yes there is a test for the chess match but still you have to lift the weight just you select it's patience off of the floor to control flex that's the number one thing that you got to do because if you pull the bar quickly from the floor and you can't control that flex then it can get away from you and the second one once you get we get the bar to your knees is to overcome that weight but just brute strength it still is about it's still about lifting that barbell the deadlift certainly does look like a simple movement as you just heard dr. Crawford talked about it is a very complex movement a lot of things you have to keep in mind in order to be successful let's take a look at the past champions here and Brian Shaw's name shows up a lot he has won three Arnold a strongman Championships the most recent coming in 2017 Hathor Bernsen who is also here he won last year and he is the defending champion and a lot of money is on the line here in this competition the first place competitor will win 72 thousand dollars second place takes home 22,000 then we work our way down to 10th place every man here will take home some sort of prize money and there's also some big money on the line here in this event we'll talk about that more in just a little bit but we mentioned half the robe yards and Brian Shaw at the top of the show they are definitely favorites not only in this competition but also in this event but there are also two other men in the field here who could do very well in this event what is a little bit of a mystery the other though a sure thing the first is Gerry Pritchett this guy knows how to deadlift yes Gerry's of prodigious deadlift er he's got a world record in powerlifting in and he ded lived at 950 at the Santa Monica Armstrong man classic which showed a lot of a lot of potential for a much heavier deadlift Jerry is a an athlete who always comes prepared but the deadlift is his specialty Gerry Pritchett really knows this implement now one man we're keeping an eye on not because he's proficient with this but because he has struggled and that is the youngster Mateos Kalish Koski from Poland Mateos is a very dynamic athlete he does a lot of things that are that are unbelievable the stone lift last year was something that shocked the strongman world but also the the at the athletes that figure out the static events later in their career the ones that become most successful mateo skill is Koski making his fifth appearance here at the Arnold strongman classic he has never finished better than third last year he was fourth one the stone to shoulder with a world record performance with the two men who will be getting most of the attention here to begin with talked about them at the top of the show you're defending champion Hathor of bjornsen and Brian Shaw they've been here a total of 18 times won the Arnold strongman Classic a total of four Jordan s'en much younger than Shaw shot 37 and 1/2 Thor at 30 years old and half Thor bjornsen like you talked about it at the top Hill he has really rounded out his game over the recent years yes he has he's figured out the static events that being the deadlift and overhead press he was always great with endurance events and also great with with power events such as tossing weight over a bar or anything that had any kind of dynamic component to it he's a complete strongman now and that's showing because he sits atop the strongman world the two will square off in the opening event it's the first of five events that will be contested over the next two days and it is a packed house here at the Greater Columbus Convention Center as these people have gathered to watch some big weight go up and possibly some record-breaking weight to go up bill you've competed what's it like to lift in front of a crowd like this well this is the faithful these are the people that know this sport and they've come here to watch they know what they're looking at so these are the people that want to see the red meat of strongman which is going to be the heaviest lifts and the most unbelievable performances and we have the ten best athletes to show those off and we are starting off with really kind of a home run derby of this competition and that is the deadlift and I've heard you talk about it before that the deadlift is really lifted if you want to know how strong somebody is you make them do it everyone yes the deadlift is not just an event which is which those are someone's power we talk about power all the time which is force times distance and how fast you can do it but really what it is it's how it's held you can just move away being able to overcome a weight completely and however long it takes and that's what the deadlift defines typically it's the strongest man that can actually do the biggest deadlift but there are some there are some components to it that have to be mastered and honestly I always thought about deadlift as an event I had to practice because you have to get these fine balance points in the Santa Monica so I was able to talk with Brian Shaw during the event and we both agreed that you've got to have just that right place to pull the bar and if you don't get that place you can either have the bar in front of you or you can pull back a bit too much so let's talk about how this event event is actually going to go down they have three lifts last night they had to pick their opening lift and we will go from lightest to heaviest and this is where the chess match kind of comes in because you've got to know not only what you're capable of but you got to make sure that you're keeping your opponents in mind while you're picking what you're gonna lift yes it's so there are several ways this could go down this could turn into where the athletes just want to sort out the competition they're gonna pick weights that they feel that they're confident with and they can get to a weight that's close to the the record-breakers weight of 1041 1041 pounds and then go for the big bake 1,100 pound or the 500 kilogram lift later but inside of that there might be strategies which play themselves out where athletes want to save points or they actually want to do look at the competition itself and not go after the bigger lift which would be at the end of this or could be at the end of this the top three men the bottom of that graphic the top three men in this event will qualify for the rogue record breakers that is not part of the competition as far as points are concerned but the three top man will have a chance to beat the world deadlift record of 1100 pounds if they do that they will win $50,000 if they beat Thor bernsen's record last year that was set on the Elephant Bar 1041 pounds they will win $5,000 so right off the bat here we are giving away some pretty big prize money and points are great in this event but there are some men who are really going to be gunning for that 50 grand here absolutely and I love them Howell Nations this is because we're not just looking for an improvement in the world's record we're actually looking to go up by over 50 pounds let's meet the 10 men who will be competing in the 2019 [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause]  [Applause] [Music]  we're gonna fight over the next two days to crown one champion two events are gonna happen on this stage right now we're going to start with this one the rogue elephant bark headland and mark this is going to be a test of wills  I think there's got to be success and winning and what's special it's thanks to one of our major host growth witness there is money on the line in this event now you break the third record in this event a 1041 pounds help I have our first person you get $5,000 on the spot but if you can live 500 1 kilo thousand dollars our next event the Musa Phelps told Gary and this is a strong man essential  [Music] by the gas - I walk around as cheap in and meeting guys and drive as many as a grill so we get to see who stands up to competition absolutely and then tomorrow we have two incredible events both inspired by the namesake of this event Arnold Schwarzenegger himself if you haven't seen it tomorrow your money will be blown by our third event the wheel of pain it's 40 feet tall 20,000 pounds after that they will be tested by the Austrian of the log press which you know that is a beast of the challenge  and then we're going to finish it out on the main stage tomorrow night and we will crown a champion with the final event the stove his shoulder and last year that event you were there that was unbelievable seeing it earlier in the competition I thought they were closing the event out with the stone to shoulder  [Music] well right now I think it's time to meet the 10 athletes who are going to be competing morning blood sweat and tears from your entertainment are you ready to meet them mark you said we sport thrives on energy are you ready to meet your athletes then ladies and gentlemen let's introduce the team happenings who will be vying for the title of 2019 Arnold sports classic world Strongest Man first up out of Slovenia 26 year old years old six feet tall 330 pounds twice lavinia Strongest Man Mattias [Applause] [Music]  [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] last year let's see if he can win another one this is here  and following in out of Canada a man who was of course in this particular event 35 years old 6 feet 2 inches tall 353 pounds seven times Canada Strongest Man and makes this stage from Estonia Rollo hi Nina this man is one of the better guys that we've seen in years past let's hope that he can perform as I put on last year I  gotta say looking at these athletes we have some guys have some experience in this contest some guys have really sugar foot threat and this guy last year was explodes to be with the revelation 25 years old 6 feet 5 inches tall 330 pounds the Polish [Applause]  [Music]  he was you know I'm you letting you've seen before but now I need you to see him again maybe together one first aid from the United States of America  and now coming to the stage  [Music]  interests recall in Mesa but everybody else knows him as a Siberian force me kya silica [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music]  these there is miss who hope the strongman for the regular deadly bar 500 rose ladies please  [Applause] [Music] so first of all I'm gonna say you-you-you open market long party in the open bar but when you lifted 500 kilos back in 2016 I would appeal over something that honestly the most wrong is right I have brought one new to beat subscribe for 2500 Caleb off the floor was the hard to spend America in my life and as you saw you know I can I basically passed out got backstage I lost my sight my memory you know it's a very very dangerous I I can appreciate what it takes to move this gonna went off the hole so if anyone does it today I will bow down I will show all God for himself with a man like [Music] you ever thought about making the transition I have all the TV shows coming on waa something up machinery  [Music]  well you know you got a lot of fanfare over the last few years documentaries and this  in my opinion the strongest  [Applause]  right lead for later  [Music]  without it I mean I pulled this on this bar couple years ago when I found it it just pulled me forward I find it harder than another bar but I feel as though they've kind of got a few mugs trained and I think it would have been very similar what end of the day it's a deadly it's a hell of a bar it shakes it forward it's going to be really excited to see what somebody goes on this today well I know if someone can match a mark on the self apart when you turn on the traditional bar they're going to get $15,000 but we were talking about this this is the first event there are five events tell us whatever 2016 we pulled that record how did you do in the rest of the competition when I call the five indicates the warm Strongest Man I had to competition because it's such a huge me to surround it completely destroys your central obviously a huge party right today I would do you think that even if it's a really tough one I mean to get eat fish in my opinion you want to be doing this and his least lips as possible so the lips are the three eighteen or twenty four six five and I think all is the minimum in my opinion  [Music]  so here's the thing and Mark you've made this one and any I want you to tell every single person who's in here when you were doing that lift how it was  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause] [Music]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  three lifts we've also been persuade by athletes are going to do when they come out here I want you  [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  yes Magnus is four-time world Strongest Man and Highland Games actually works to pull you forward [Music] using the straps strap is a very different lift in some ways than the done strap you see the athlete get his hips down no problem good let me have time he just wants to get an event in make sure that he's had a chance to fill the bar coming off the bottom you see how the bar does flex the end of those plates come off the come off last and that's what it gives that flex and that pulls you forward he has been dealing with somewhat of a hip issue as well said one looks like it's better not us Keller's Koski from Poland another man who looks to be the future of strongman trying to improve on his fourth place finish from last year's Arnold strongman classic he is also opening and 706 pounds different types of  796 from our two scalars class [Music]  796 looks great for Kalish Koski is his first lift is successful sometimes that can hold you up a little bit as the bar clears your knees that Earling can actually catch it but he did a very good job [Music]  lexie Novikov competition these athletes and he sees like that he's talking to their Brian he's he's been a fan of and now he's competing against Novikov was here last year but he was not on this main stage to see how he handles the crowd here now he's talking to one of the officials yes that DN Wessels notice how many of the athletes are coming out of sock feet are very very low shoes what that does that decreases the length of how far do you have to hold the bar have a higher she won't like a running shoe that's another hitch half the pole and these kind of weights 802 for Alexei Novikov as he was just confirming his weight with the athletes had to declare their weight last night they did have one chance to change it after warm-ups today yes looks like he's making a fashion statement is he's getting getting his scraps ready there you know two for lucky number  [Music]  820 is good for the youngster yes we have gone three for three so far yes Novikov looked Novikov looks a little relieved that he got that weight up I'm pulling a little bit of Shake in that that means his hamstrings are really he also has a very narrow foot stance and that narrow foot stance made and said he's going to have to pull that bar further many times for deadlifts that you see in penalty competitions but in the last several years there have been many of the strongmen athletes are now having a wider foot stance and the straps allow the strongman sitting back more you see he started to roll the bar the bar with this much flex that really doesn't help you that much with a stiffer bar like in powerlifting or a shorter bar rolling the bar back actually keeps that keeps the end of the hips active it actually makes it sort of a dynamic lift a little bit more off the bottom and I can tell you if your time it correctly it makes the weight feel a little bit lighter coming off the first six inches of the floor how does John Francis Walker own out of Canada he's the 2018 Arnold Classic Africa champion that's how we qualified this year and he is stepping up to nine hundred four pounds I'm making a big jump from Alexi Nova cops 820 he's in the thousand pound Club  also wearing socks  and korone drops 904 me he grabs his right hamstring there gingerly walking back to the bench ojf korone talking to Brian Shawn it looks like her own grab for his right hamstring after this attempt dropping his hip starts to pull and immediately stop as soon as the weight cleared the floor so the end of those plates as soon as those came off it looked like it was going to start very well something's happened to his hamstring we will have to see if that's something that will affect him the rest of the way but jf2 rolling right now looking at a tenth place finish in this event unfortunately if he doesn't if he's not able to come out hill he will get last place points for this the other piece of this if he does actually declare another weight and it's got to be pretty close to that one because you just want to get an attempt in we call it bombing out if you don't get it if you don't get a valid attempt in and he cannot go lighter because again weight cannot come off the bar he has to attempt more than his last lift yes that's a very traditional way to perform any strength competition once you put weight on you can't take it off  Australia champion making his second appearance here at the next very good deadlift I really like his style  as he setting up getting the straps on what you're gonna see as he sets his hips very firmly takes the slack out of the bar and pushes his feet down into the floor very hard I think it's a very smooth start  first attempt to run a high level and that will cow get the weight on the bar for you but the most important thing for mindless and his first attempt is good  which is very quickly very dynamic lift yes here's the flex the bar a little bit differently and then he actually pushes his feet down as we talked about goes too far to his knees pretty quickly isn't like it pulled him forward I bet he's been practicing with the bars complexity  I was very impressed by his deadlift  take a second to mention bill that knurling that you see that rough spot opposite of that smooth middle do a good job of scraping up your legs yes it does so deadlift bars are known for that any car with it with flex in it and what happens is that bar comes off the floor and goes right into your shin you notice that he actually had the bar an inch or so above in front of his shin when he started so when he pulled back it does good it hits you right in the shin Ezra that's why I've really one of the things you want to focus on is being patient at the bottom let's live with this kind of are and trying to get just a little bit more just a little bit more time to push from the bottom here's where we stand so far we are through five athletes at the heaviest are just in the first round and we still have five more athletes to lift that's not surprising Brown oh is it's a very good deadlift er as we as we talked about he placed third in the deadlift world championships in 2016  here's Martines DC's with his first attempt he won the Arnold Classic Europe competition also won the Arnold Classic USA competition that was held a couple months ago in Santa Monica right there on the pier 420 kilos for leases that is no problem yes he was very patient so head judge Magnus ver Magnusson give the down signal  sitting way back to pull the bar back back back back and that's exactly what the straps allow you to do and a little bit wider foot stance you could really focus on pulling back what that does it allows you to have your shins more upright it allows you to then use your levers to pull back from the bar  one of the major mistakes that people make when they deadlift if they can't find that spot they end up forgetting that getting their shoulders in front of the bar and there are their knees in front of the bar when that happens it's very difficult to pull back it's not like a clean where you need your shoulders in front of the bar and then you can worse - where you need your shoulders in front of the bar posterior chain Labor's to get the car accelerated or the deadlift you want to sit back through it again this isn't just power this is strength the Siberian forest makalah schibler cough is a next 950 pounds for his first attempt 431 kilos [Music] this is quite a start for him we've seen in the past he has a heart  [Music]  no problem for Shimla cough 950 in the books for him and his opening lift one more look at that one so notice how he dips his hips and that gives him some dynamic gives him a little bit of dynamic force instead of pulling on the allowing the bar to roll back on to him with this much flex you really can't do that so he puts some dynamic opening movement on it by flexing his hips down half-door does the same thing I can tell you personally when you do that when you sit down as far you can feel your posterior chain particularly your hamstrings tighten up just a little bit it gives you a little bit of spring now we couldn't we forget we're in opening attempts so what happens these guys are very common coming trying to make sure that they can have a good attempt and then move forward we'll talk a little bit more about what happens when when there's more weight on the bar and what the crowd does for you and one of what an athlete's mental aspect goes for you that is Brian Shaw he has finished first or second year at the Arnold strongman classic seven of the last eight years from the second last year afterward Norton and his opening left will also be 950 pounds this is a man we expect to see in the top three and maybe make a run to that 500 kilo I'm with a very wide foot placement he tells me likes to wear some one of us should see a very flat shoe as the other athletes like to wear socks but he said for him he likes to really be able to push out on his feet  [Music] 350 pounds for brian show  [Applause]  and that goes up easily very easily done so he uses two he's applying two of those principles he's actually rolling the bar back once our rolls the bar back flex his hips down and stands up very very easily that was a very commanding lift he's been practicing on a longer as I said he always comes prepare Brian Shaw with 950 pounds impressive lift for his first attempt and now you're defending champion ather abusin and the record holder in this event at 1041 pounds his opening attempt five more pounds in Brian Shaw he's going to go for 955 so that Stephan so me Peterson his coach Stephan so he is a world-class strong man in his own right place is HEIs [Music]  after setting up  he's had terrific training vitamist follow that on the the Internet  [Music] he also has a very wide foot stance just like Charlie's to the tolerated similar setups after work g\u00c3\u00b6ransson attempt number one 955 pounds  [Applause] gravity is not a problem for that man with 955 pounds that goes up just like Brian Shaw is opening lists lifts so now the battle is started between Shaw and fjords and one more look at Jordans opening left they both do the same thing they roll the bar back they commanded that flex has been practicing who flanked with that bar the other thing too is they do that little hip dip and that activates our posterior chain it looks like dr. Lorenson another man we expect to see in that room record breakers event immediately following this event first of five events that these men will be competing in over the next two days  more weight being added for Gerry Bridget who will go after nine hundred seventy four pounds okay so we're starting to see some of the some of the gamesmanship Gerry's really playing inside of having confessed placement possible and it looks like he's going to take a big leap at the end to strike he was to get that popped really striking that 500 kilos as he is it's a great deadlift we saw him full 950 at Santa Monica and it looked easier than the 700-pound point I think he might agree with that he looked great in Santa Monica we had Brian Shawn booth while he was lifting and if you watch Jerry Pritchett what makes him I think so good is it looks the same regardless of the weight on the bar and he has the same [Music] 174  putting his straps on he chooses a wide foot placement he pulls a little bit like Andy Bolton's Andy Bolton style where he does he uses the his lever of his hips of his back Pritchett right to work in 974 goes up  [Music]  Chief Richard is looking to be the third man to possibly get himself into that robe record-breakers say can you look at this this happen yes a little bit of a hip dip doesn't roll the bar back but notice how he kind of looks down as he starts his pull what that allows him to do is just pulled back back back he uses really levers not necessarily that that dynamic hip round one is done we had ten athletes go nine of them had a successful lifts and Jerry frigid had the heaviest lifts at 974 pounds followed by half wolf urine Brian Shaw  6.now the athletes will enter their second weights and again we will go from lightest up to heaviest and there's a good bet that Jerry Pritchard will be one of the man  happiness being done  - so Shawn just to put this in perspective deadlift for the straps in 2011 was set by sternness viscous around 970 and here comes Jerry Bridget in an opening attempt it made it look fourteen and that would have been the world record just a few years ago and strongmen Jerry actually pulled the world's record in the in powerlifting a couple of years a couple years ago and it was on a second attempt because he had to rush off and catch a plane because the beam was running late he didn't even get his third attempt and he pulled a deadlift world record in parallel which means no strap across hand pull was one of ten men to go in the first round jf Peron  was the only man who didn't have a successful lift entered himself on this attempt at 904 pounds he will be we do not know whether or not he will stay in the competition a hamstring injury a hip injury that's that's sort of like having a knee injury for running back or a shoulder injury for baseball that's really hard because that that hip flexion is dependent those hamstrings and as dairy prison demand right now  everybody's good song yes everyone's been talking about half-door and in Brian's preparation for the deadlift but really I don't want to be too emphatic about this Jerry is right in that hunt Gerry Pritchett didn't have the best overall result last year but he is a great deadlift or these are your top two men from last year after up yours and on the left of Brian Shaw on the right Pritchett finished sixth in 2018 but we're starting off with an event that is definitely his strength  now they're starting to get a little more serious you can see their their faces are a little more concentrated more concentration their face so when you're pulling a heavy deadlift there when you get to the higher weights there's the way that the deadlift looks and the way that the deadlift feels this is Pritchett opening lifted 974 pounds and that look that looked easy and it probably felt pretty good for them too so if you could get your first lift and that creates a lot of can't affect yourself from the tips look at his first lifted 974 pounds I don't think people understand how difficult that isn't Gerry Pritchett makes that look yes notice he uses his hips but he used them in a different way he really uses his hips to to keep to keep his low back in that position and he gets against the bar up to his up to his knee and then his back is in a great position just  it keeps a very flat back position even if he looks down at the initial particle that's not negotiable  some of the more experienced editors also sort of let there  slow forward a bit and that's something that requires a lot of cracks  we get into these heavier weights we found the 1980s that there was actually  at the Greater Columbus Convention Center this was first-come first-served for a lot of the seating and these people were showing up early  to be able to watch these ten  this is round two  great lift for Calais Cosby  it seems to be limping just a bit  one more look see we can see where flavored into trouble you really had the double hits that just a little bit that might have been what got him so notice how his feet are also closer together he's also got a more narrow hand stance over bars I think with this height he would be better served by having a wider foot stance that will cut down the distance also would help him use his levers that's terrific leaders Mateos killers Cosby's weakness is the deadlift if he wants to see alive next he is the rookie 840 pounds for Novikov  it takes some time to develop your man muscles so these younger athletes are that lesson firsthand  certainly has the most colorful Sokcho so and in the athletes helping with his first attempt today 20 in now  [Music]  [Music]  we'll get the lift so two for two the youngster from Ukraine  also with a very narrow foot stance and if you'll if you'll notice zero foot stance only inflection look where his thumb is his thumb is actually both of his thumbs are in front of the bar so he's using the strap completely to hold that bar  - for Alexei Novikov 840 pounds good  bojong's Bell shock will be up next  six his opening  you do have to admire this apparatus I'm in this implement these plates are just beautiful this is this is unbelievable  got the white will white will dish just like the old New York plates did facts Rebecca in the 40s and 50s when they did bumper plates so that made a little less shock on the place but each and every one is handcrafted  the Austrian oak himself right inside the plate those are beautiful that's as martine species who hit 900  here's bad Josh Bell check out of Slovenia  watch out 260 pounds  a restaurant in Slovenia where he sometimes works as an apprentice chef it probably halls a lot of big objects around that restaurant that's 860 that goes up easily  a little bit of hip flex  very smoothly done so any kind of hip issue you'd had previously it looks like that's been solved I think he's going to take a big leap because he had two very good attempts he solved a little bit of the problem with the Flex the bar he's probably going to take a pretty big jump meaning he's going to look at doing them probably close to 900 pounds rado Hilah from Estonia we'll be up next 950 pounds he was eighth overall last year at the 2018 arnold strongman classic six time estonia's Strongest Man  yes Estonia the home of George Hackenschmidt  beautiful documentary that was done by rogue addict again it's pretty amazing that men from countries that have traditions and strength find themselves on the high altar of strength the armature oh man classic state just as J up her own he himself also is from Quebec just like Louis Cyr so this tradition lives much these strong countries that have traditions  some of the some of the athletes choose to the thinner straps something like the thicker shrimps serranos right for that is a tattoo that reads you want it then fight for it  six years ago we tore his right Achilles tendon doctors told him he would just have to recover from it  we had some surgeries Oh  as a SIL injury he feels from time to time but here he is competing in the 2019 Armstrong a classic and trying to defend them 950 pounds from his second three attempts I love the way solidly locks his hips as before scars [Music]  righto Hilah hits 950 pounds it's very happy I don't know if that's a personal best for him but he's very happy with that so far that sets him up to get a bigger lift  he's setting his hands use this uses a fairly narrow hand and hip placement foot placement  he gets his feet gets his feet together I just love the way again now he walks his hips into this lift it really does that lift that lifting style pushing his feet down looking down when he starts to live  excellent live so he's looking down till he gets the bar to his knees and then he just looks up and that's a style too many power lifters use  Island 954 athletes here in the second of three rounds so commanding that flex allows him to pull more weight because I believe he got just nine with only nine hundred pounds but at the Santa Monica show without this longer bar fighting off the bar again making sure everyone's safe  and these guys have seen each other's blood time they trained together  here's parties theses his second attempt 970 pounds four pounds last and frigid lifted around water  and nine 70s junk for the dragon that is a personal best for him every point counts and he's moving himself up there are four more events after this  a lot of hip flexion notice how he bounces that bar heavily into his shins but he's got those it's got those knee wraps that cover them to offset that that really a violent pullback lisa says certainly one of the more animated athletes in the field he does not hold back after that lift and now mikhail sholokhov second attempt for him  looking to tie Gerry Pritchett frontally fat Bridget has yet to lift in the second round his first lift look really really good so this should be a solid lift world  but again there's a way that lifts look and in the way they look the lifts feel so it's hard to tell what's going through mathletes head when they're getting through the second third attempts  Russian maybe as a barista that's why where's that  third overall last year than 20  I think one of the things that always jump out about me with this athlete is he really commits himself he is committed to making this lift  let's lift the tie Jerry Bridget  [Music]  [Applause] and simplify with the blood running from his nose that is common for him he has that problem  974 pounds  solid off the off the bottom controls that flex gets it to his knees and has to shake it a little bit to get it back and then the blood coming out of his nose he did that last year like I said he really commits he doesn't that doesn't bother him  Shelagh cop making sure that the maintenance crew stays busy they are cleaning the bar we for you we have we Bandar brothers for he completes with me today [Music]  and these guys are really close you can see them on the side talking to each other saying you know good lift or you know maybe do this or that  Brian Shaw is up next and we're moving into the thousand-pound fluff now 1021 pounds on the bulges 40 pounds less than half for his top dark mark that he put up last year of 1041 pounds and now things getting serious for Brian Shawn round two setting up the big wide foot placement  Shaw locked in and ready to go 1021 pounds on the ball  and Brian Shaw stands up 1,000 21,000 on his a personal best for him on the elephant bar and here we go bill yes that was just a second attempt so he's going to put another big attempt on his third attempt in the competition I don't think he's even thinking about the 500 kilos right now he's thinking about competition points pushes off the floor gets it to his knees efficiently pulls back no wasted movement Jerry Bridget gets the follow van and Jerry frigid is adding weight to the bar [Music] 1030 pounds where Jerry Pritchard is Brian Shaw now has one flip remaining  leave now  Brian Shaw I believe this would be a personal best for him as well on the old  so now we're getting into the big prey locking into these big dead days  ten-thirty ones actually his first the best not quite as personal best but this is still just a second attempt here comes frigate approaching the 1030 pounds look at all the cameras coming out in the crowd this is a big moment here early in this competition  a really long strap getting right to work and Bridget comes up limping so 1030 does not go up for Jerry Bridget  [Music] one more look 1030 pounds  there was a lot of Shake in the bar at the beginning I think he just have the spots that are pulled in forward and I think that that's what's happening for the a police then  they did pull the bar a little bit more quickly than and that's the best investment that's the issue with this car is it's got a control that shake the other thing is that that you've got to overcome what your body's telling it what to stop going after our Puritan up max he has the record on this implement at 1041 pounds he is looking to change that with only his second live one thousand forty five pounds on the bar for the mountain this would be a new world record spawn the Elephant Bar this is only as a second his second attempt this shows that he is ready getting some Icelandic Viking Berserker going lowering all inhibitions 1045 pounds and a new elephant bar world record at stake right now for the man they call them out half Thor bjornsen and only the second round he has one lift remaining after this  [Music]  give me a break how easy is that in a new world record 1045 pounds for the mountains I mean come on bill that is ridiculous that was very very impressive that was very very impressive I actually am almost speechless by that people he pulled that bar from the bottom and there was almost no doubt as soon as he started the poem this is a new world record he beats his mark from last year and look how easy this is absolutely he's got that pull back he dips his hips posterior chains activated he's looking down gets it to his knees pulls back he's got all those components down  he is your new leader your new world-record holder and we have one round to go  as Georgeson will gets a well-deserved rest as we get set for round three here are your standings after aborting Brian Shaw second Jerry Bridget could not get 1030 pounds with is still in third place overall mikhail sholokhov of martine species rounding out the top five  sixth place right Brian's 1021 looked good but it wasn't that that would appear that easy anyway  as we expected the battle between the two favorites starting early  Brian Shaw is gonna try to chase down after fjords in round number three everybody else is basically going for positioning and points in this event as we get ready for round three and Brian Shawn looks on let's take one more look at this world record left  it takes it takes a long pull back on the bar perfect timing  he just got all the components right he just got all the components right that was perfect  after bjornsen has just fired up after that the record is the big record 500 kilos 1,100 pounds given what you have seen so far today bill and you think that record is in danger yes he told me last year the English 500 kilogram Lauren that's great but it looks like he's set up himself pretty pretty well to at least make a very strong run and he went ahead of the competition so that was going to be interesting to see what Ryan does for his next attempt  does you get just a bit more than this and and understands that half the work and try to make too big of a jump is half tour going right after the next big attempt being the 500 kilograms isn't playing for the points now we're waiting for weight selections we are through two of three rounds the opening event of the 2019 Arnold strongman classic the first of five events that will be contested over the next two days this is the most prestigious and the heaviest strongman event throughout the year and that man Brian Shaw looking to reclaim his title last year second overall to half their appearance in Brian's favorite saying to people is you don't always have to be the strongest but you do have to be the smartest and he always proves that here's what these two athletes have done over their careers 18 total appearances here at the Arnold strongman classic between the two shot got started a little bit earlier than bjornsen they've won four times between the two of them Shaw older than yours and at 37 years old but half Thor last year really established himself as the man to beat and Brian Shaw really wants to reclaim his title as we are set for round three in matches Kayla scoffs key is up first interestingly he's put his feet out a little bit 871 pounds on the bar for Kayla's Koski this would be a best live for him  [Music]  and kalish Koski will get it now although he is not in contention for the win in this event that is going to be a big confidence builder for this kid absolutely it's another step forward it's another step forward so you got a you got a personal best he did put his feet out look his feet are just a little bit further than they were previously he had a good push off the floor and he had to pitch it back but it's a good lift and he gets some applause on the left of your screen for Brian Shaw he said he would love to have Kayla's Koski at his gym and help train him in the deadlift yes and again that shows that that there is a Brotherhood this is rarefied air that these men are trying to be as strong as possible and redefine how strong people can be really and in that quest only just totally strong been understand  that's about Josh Bell shock looking on  prepares himself for his third and final if Alexi Novikov will be a max 884 pounds another very talented youngster making his first appearance here at the Arnold strongman class he was your ammeter champion last year that's how he earned his way into this competition going for over 400 kilograms is a must for any strongman they used to be a really a watermark but now it's just sort of live that gets you into the upper edge  is a watermark especially for a 23 year old  [Music]  that lowers your inhibitions lower your inhibitions allows your nervous system to cut loose any sort of control that says stop doing this throw yourself forward into it another old trick was to drink a shot of whiskey before a big day  that way go on this I've seen in this competition whatever you need to do I've seen it before  [Music] Novica 884 pounds [Music]  just cannot get into his knees and then overcome the weight and he will bow out but a good opening / forwards for the rookie Alexey Novikov his best lift 840 pounds one more he has very narrow foot placement it with the narrow foot placement he's got his feet pointing Warburg so if he even pointed his toes outward a lot of great power-ups and dead lifters have they can have that close foot placement but they point their toes out that allows you to activate your quadriceps water it's actually a pretty good quad exercise with  with their feet straight and knees pointing forward like that it just turns into all hands bringing back  Novikov goes to 4-3 not judge Bell shocked up next making the jump from 862 890 1012 these are very likeable laughs that I'd love to see him get this closing in on 900 pounds he knows this is over 1/4 kilogram left and carefully selected wait because he's looking for point placement  and unlike many of the other athletes  [Music] there's a 91 production  and that will count not Josh Bell shotgun a slovenia perfect three for three in the elephant bar Desmond beautiful  we talked about anything it takes punching himself in the forehead to get himself fired up there we go they think it's his focus going lowers his inhibitions and he commits he really gets that far past Aziz quickly I think he had more in the tank question  righto Heinlein will be up next as Belle shock  takes a break his event is 979 279 pounds the man from Estonia  I mean again it's kind of ridiculous that we're little laissez-faire about the fact that he's pulling close to a thousand pounds this is a fantastic dinner and like you mentioned this was a marked man not very long ago was seen as possibly unreachable yes the world record the strong man rose right  notice he's got those dick wraps against us on the shins so he's gonna pull that bar against his shins detection  sometimes that that actually causes a little more friction as the neural  just like me raps  some of these things are trade offs  [Music]  [Music]  we'll get that solid hip placement and get this the  I won't get it to go  and you will go to 4/3 this opening of that great effort  he had his knees just in front of the bar when he started the lift even though he corrects that hole  and get those knees more solidly place  we got the cop  bitch either way  974 that means  species because silikov has changed his way they do have the option to do that in this flat around they can make one change  I really like the sequence of events because  deadlifting great complementary exercises these guys are pulling big deadlifts and they've all been training with carrying slabs and shoulders let's go limping is said their their debt these deserts I know training heavier with the deadlift and focusing on them but I think they're very complimentary Arty's theses up next and this is a huge lift for him 1,001 pounds turn himself into that exclusive 1,000 pounds room  Amanda  [Music]  he is as a result of that tutelage 1,001 pounds can become a six-man to lift four digits  feces will not get it to go in the club stays  well  gets his hips down guess the bar started barely broken off around another day for deadlift training I'm still a very young athlete in terms of top-level competition  he did pulled over 900 pounds a couple of years ago with the army  now McHale should the cop will come up next one thousand five pounds silikov we're looking to finish inside the top in this opening events that come up nicely for the rest of the competition total commitment  he will continue to pull  silikov cannot give 1005 to go the Siberian for snagging the crowd let's showing how that mythic  that number has got to get in there back to once you put four digits did you know that as a competitor that's got to get into instant inside the brain  good he had a good start on that  a little bit quick more quickly than he's been he wasn't his patient on that he was trying to get a little more gas going on it yes the fans are aware of 1000 now  big events that happen the US  this would be a rich this would be a record for Brian Shaw with the elephant 1049 pounds after our yards and just set the Newmarket 1045 that was in round two and he has yet to lift so he could trade records here Brian Shaw looking to set the new world record on the elephant bar but remember Hathor bjornsen has yet to go  he's visualizing his lifts he's thinking just looking up he's saying okay I've got it he's got a checklist in his head I'm certain he's got a checklist in his head in other words he says he's going to get to speak a certain spot hands in a certain spot can feel a leverage point he's gonna push that with his feet to focus on getting that board  wait for the top he's checking off with his head what has to happen here  Brian Shaw looking to jump now throw up your Chi for first place in this event set a new elephant bar world record in the process yes he really wants this [Music] will we see another record 1040 five pounds for Bryan Shaw getting upset getting himself set up he's had all year to think about last year when he had a chance for the third deadlift to take the lead  [Applause]  and Shah falling forward over the bar on that attempt it will not go for him and that means it half-door bjornsen is the winner of this event with one lift remaining so every one more look at Brian Shaw and as the crowd salutes him everybody's got their phones up trying to record history a little bit of flex in the bar those leverage points are so hard to find that bar pulled him forward notice he pulled back as he started to pull back the bar got caught against his shin mark bar gets caught against your shin I can make your hips go forward a little bit  so  half Thorbjorn C is your next man and he is going to go for that magic number eleven hundred pounds five hundred kilos is the Marquis needs to be this is a fifty thousand dollar lift he's getting ready to make he already has the Elephant Bar world record he set that in his last lift at 1045 pounds he can set another one with his third and final lift and take home 50 grand in the process  this is absolutely a story absolutely  okay they're going to go through their ritual to get him mentally ready to start this bull all this training all this thinking about this goal of lifting over 500 kilograms setting the all-time world record not just the elephant bar deadlift record but the all-time world record in the deadlift from from the ground so we've equipped the thousand-pound mark now we're in the 1100 after bjornsen staring at history and 1105 pounds getting the crowd behind him as he lies up for his third and final attempt $50,000 [Music] for Hathor bjornsen  for all the marbles here it is  at the knees at bjornsen cannot get it  blood coming from his forehead that's how intense that effort was he sets the Elephant Bar dev deadlift record he wins the event but the mountain cannot best the Beast and the record remains in any halls possession for the time yes it does but what you did good but what he did get was an important win for points  here's one more look at what it would it would have been history his hips came up just a little more quickly than they have on the other lips patient off the floor his hips came up a little more quickly  after Lorenson looks like it strike himself from the forehead to sort of get himself psyched up and then when he started to live I started to believe Jordan wins the event 1045 pounds in a new elephant bar world record Brian Shaw will finish second Gerry Pritchett despite the fact that he didn't make a third lift will tie for third with Mia Kyle shimla cough markings feces the top-5 one record is set and it was haftorah bjornsen and this was the lift that did it 1045 pounds  gotta say I was hip place was just a little bit lower with that  Hathor Bernsen on just his second left best the mark that he sent last year by four pounds and earns ten points in the process Brian Shaw will get 9 Pritchett and Shiva cough seven and a half each that's the third and fourth-place added together and then split that's why at seven point five of our team's basis finishes in fifth one event down and one record has already fallen here at the Arnold strongman classic and it belongs to that man after abuse and Jerry printed with a strong showing as become the guy oh look off did well  or events remain though and the mountain has the lead stay with us here the Husa fell stone carry event to is up next at the 2019 Arnold strongman classic", "nS9W-wlJHPA": "We've all found ourselves in conversation and felt attacked like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk. Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb. So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation having earned more respect than you had going in. So first off, to stop a conversational bully, you have to realize what's going on before it's too late. Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on with their tone of voice and their word choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d kind of like this \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ...but I wasn't specifically aiming this message at young men to begin with; it just kind of turned out that way but\u00e2\u20ac\u201d And it's mostly, you admit, it's mostly men listening. In this case, Cathy is indicating very clearly that she thinks Jordan has done something wrong. Otherwise, why would she use the word \"admit?\" She makes her stance clear a moment later when she implies that he should be bothered for being divisive. Just watch. Does it bother you that your audience is predominantly male? Is that a bit divisive? The point here is that even when they're being passive-aggressive, people will often indicate that they're about to attack you before they actually do. So if you hear someone say something like, \"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?\" be prepared. That person thinks that you've done something wrong and you need to be very careful what you say next not because you did do something wrong but because a conversational bully may be trying to trap you into saying something that you disagree with so that they can attack that straw man. And the first way that this often happens is called the \"so-you\\'re-saying trap.\" Here\\'s what it looks like. So you're saying women have some sort of duty to sort of help fix the crisis of masculinity? Women want to dominate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is that what you're saying? So you're saying that anyone who believes in equality whether you call them feminists or whatever you want to call them should basically give up because \"it ain\\'t gonna happen.\" Let me just get this straight; you're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters. The general pattern here is that someone says, \"So you\\'re saying...\" and then proceeds to oversimplify or mischaracterize what you actually said. I won't spend too long here because it's very easy to spot and it's rather simple to avoid and get around by saying, \"Well, actually, what I was saying is...\" and then repeat yourself. ...along the lines of the lobsters. I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures. But there's a much sneakier way that people may mischaracterize your beliefs and then attack them. Basically, it's when someone's words imply that you believe something you don't and they don't actually say it. So in business, they call this \"assuming the sale\" like when a car salesman says, \"So would you like that with the leather interior or with the fabric interior?\" before you even decided to buy the car. Now, with the several thousand dollar purchase, you're likely to notice this and say, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said I was buying in the first place?\" But it's very likely that this is happening to you in conversation all the time and you don't even notice. Here's how it might look. [Cathy talks over Jordan] Yeah, but why? Why should woman put up with those reasons? Embedding the question \"why should women put up with it?\" are several important presuppositions; namely \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one, that there is something to put up with and two, that Jordan thinks woman should put up with it. Now, the trap here for Jordan would be to answer Cathy's question directly and many of us fall into it in similar situations then we start arguing for things that we don't even really believe just out of habit. Instead, you need to identify that hidden presupposition and then call it out. So watch how carefully Jordan listens to Cathy's questions so that he can catch what she's not saying. \"Why should women put up with it?\" I\\'m not saying they should put up with it. I\\'m saying that the claim\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Here's another example of assuming-the-sale from later in that conversation. See if you can spot the hidden presupposition and ask yourself what you might say to respond to it. ...which women do a lot of. But why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children? So what's the hidden presupposition \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that Jordan thinks women must have children. And of course, he defends a woman's right to make any decision about that. ...the right to choose and demand it, correct? They do. They can. Yeah, that's fine. But you're saying that makes them unhappy. Here's one more example. See if you can spot the hidden presupposition here. [Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your followers now, \"Quit the abuse. Quit the anger.\" Did you catch it? The presupposition is that Jordan's followers are abusing people. Now, he can't answer that question directly; he has to address that hidden point first and he does. Well, we'd need some substantial examples of the abuse and the anger before I could detail that question. There's a lot of it out there. When I cut the clips like this, it makes it very easy to see these hidden presuppositions but in real time, this can be difficult. One simple thing that you can do to make it easier on yourself is to purposely assume a relaxed posture as Jordan does throughout this entire conversation. Now, this posture actually helps you to think less frantically because your body is signalling to your brain that everything is okay; you're in control. You'll also want to give yourself some time to pause after each question which Jordan definitely does. In addition, you're going to want to study up on frames and frame games because there's a clearly a whole level of conversation that is going on behind the words. Now, I've talked about this in other videos specifically the one on Tyrion Lanister from Game of Thrones and I'll leave a link to that in the description if you want to check it out. Moving along though, the last clip contains a small example of the third conversational bully tactic in this video which I\\'m naming the \"smash technique.\" Take a look. [Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your followers now, \"Quit the abuse. Quit the anger.\" It's subtle here but Cathy smashes together two very different terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d abuse and anger. Now, by ending on anger, it would be easier for Jordan to just forget it and answer the question. But that would tacitly accept that his followers were abusing people. That's why the smash technique is so frustrating; people are embedding hidden statements that you actually disagree with and then moving through them before you have the time to voice that disagreement. You may also have seen people barrage you with questions just to overwhelm you into having to accept their points like this \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ...otherwise, why would that only be seven women running FTSE 100 companies in the UK? Why would there still be a pay gap... [Jordan talks over Cathy] Why are women at the BBC saying that they're getting paid illegally less than men\u00e2\u20ac\u201d It can be easy to get overwhelmed and to lose focus as you try to answer all of these questions but with the smash technique in general, the best policy is to slow down the tempo of conversation and tackle one question or one point at a time. Let's just go to the first question; those both are complicated questions. So hopefully, now you're more aware of the so-you're-saying trap when people \"assume the sale\" and of course, the smash technique. This moves us to the second section of this video which is how to persuade someone in these kinds of situations. And I will say, it seems to me that it doesn't look like Jordan is necessarily trying to change Cathy's mind but simply to debate in front of an audience. There are still some valuable tips to be gleamed from this video and a few things that I'd add First, do not straw man the other person's ideas even if they're doing it to you. And to be clear, I don't know if I mentioned this, straw manning is when you create a caricature of their ideas and then attack those rather than what they truly believe. Instead, show the other person that you are truly engaging in their real points, attempt to understand them, and sometimes this mean that you have to ask them to repeat themselves so that you can. Seven? Seven women... repeat that one\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Seven women running the top FTSE 100 companies in the UK. Well, the first question might be. After you've made an honest attempt to understand them, you need to make sure that they can understand you which is necessary for persuasion. And to do that, you often have to use the visual imagery. For instance, here's a very abstract point without any images that Jordan makes. ...that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures. It's absolutely inevitable. And there is one-third of a billion years of evolutionary history behind that. Now, maybe you can understand that but it kind of lacks any emotional oomph. But notice how the addition of a concrete example makes that one-third of a billion years just feel different. That's so long that a third of a billion years ago, there weren't even trees; it's a long time. So adding concrete examples especially ones that people can easily imagine is a smart persuasive move and lastly, when you're arguing, oftentimes the best way to get someone to change their position is not by changing their mind but by gently showing them that they are already agreeing with you. I talked about this in the frame video but here's an example from this interview. Why should your rights to freedom of speech trump a trans-person's right not to be offended? Because in order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive. I mean, look at the conversation we're having right now. You know, like, you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth. Why should you have the right to do that? It's been rather uncomfortable. This is huge. Jordan is no longer arguing that her point is wrong; he's arguing that she already agrees with him \u00e2\u20ac\u201d her behavior and her previous statements demonstrate that she cares more about free speech than not offending people. And then Jordan doesn't try to make this point wrong; he shows her how they're actually very much in alignment. You're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on. And I gave you what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me. And that's fine. I think \u00e2\u20ac\u201d more power to you as far as I'm concerned. And then of course Cathy feels stumped because she does actually agree with Jordan and she's proven it herself. People have a strong desire to remain consistent with things they've already said and done so oftentimes, this becomes one of the few ways to persuade someone who's really dug in their heels. You're basically showing them that they don't have to move in order to agree with you; they already do right where they're dug in. And then of course, Jordan hits her with the \"gotcha.\" ...uh, and... [sighs] I'm just trying to work that out but I mean... [sighs] Jordan: Hah. Gotcha. Cathy: You have got me. You have got me. Even though I laughed at that phrase at the time I was watching the interview, I have to say that last bit \"gotcha\" does not improve Jordan\\'s persuasive case. It actually makes Cathy feel silly and wrong as opposed to happy to discover that she and Jordan are really on the same team all along and if I had to give one last point of constructive criticism, it would be that Jordan answered all of Cathy's questions rather than trying to proactively address her deeper unstated emotional concern. And in my opinion, that emotional concern is that Jordan is her enemy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that if he believes something, it must be against her interests. If Jordan could have found that and pointed to a more common ground that they share which we all of course have, I don't think the interview would have continued in such an argumentative fashion but Jordan's role isn't necessarily to convince Cathy Newman of anything \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's to debate for an audience and to promote his book which I think he did at an A+ level.

yeah all right last time you're here we worked out with a 110-pound rock climber where is he he's 109 pounds now yeah but we we got this specialized grip implement called the Beast grips 420 blaze it it's pretty cool yeah and you can put any rock climbing hold on it because has this bolt and that's our carabiner because it doesn't come with one which is pretty dumb but you're gonna attach the loading pin so we're gonna experiment with a hold and make all these climbers try it right because this is what you hold yeah if I can do this you can't - yeah I mean it's a defense on I mean you weigh more than me I don't know eat a little bit more than me at this yeah yeah we're currently using the 30-degree angle okay who's got flat round so it's simulating a rock climbing holds but right we got a bucket look at guys we can use all of these on here there's a pocket these are crimps all this stuff and we're gonna try them all out yeah yeah World Records eight World Records today right how much weight is on this I don't know I didn't count I have no idea easy okay this is on YouTube Nick you've been given vascularity still all sick ok wait did you just do it you did yeah wait do it again it's body weight of B script 420 blaze it nice for now until we go up and wait shoes ok everybody's taking this pumping down right well let's increase it wait one more time yeah sure good bo get in on it Bo's the control he is an on rock climber well you're pretty large oh nice 125 I don't want to beat rock climbers don't want to beat these kids yeah that was a good lip damn it good lord alright alright guys hey what kind of chalk you're trying out there well oh that's Petzl odd never heard of them before would you recommend peso sure I would there's better chalk actually white dogs is even better  this is 100 we're gonna feel a little better about myself now this is 125 yeah yeah all right I beat someone yeah this is great I'm winning and somehow that's hard okay I didn't think snowboard is that grip strength so it makes sense boy I ain't gonna help Isaac I know this is 16 pounds more than you weigh Isaac when do you weigh yourself yeah morning or night oh I don't weigh myself regularly but like afternoon afternoon after a meal he's 109 pounds do you weigh like 107 will put that tight [Laughter]  oh damn wait here come on this side side wait is that Nicky Coleman yeah I know everything is asking you about your chalk and I just eat it there you go Matt this is heavy all right well we gotta see the strongest of us are we gonna blow out your fingers that's exactly how they do it that's what the lips okay come on  Wow I got heavy possible yeah okay we drive it right hand he did 135 pounds for Magnus meatball meatball bangs meatball we don't call him that okay Oh Oh God now that we have a grip implement that's a rock climbing home yeah maybe disgusting yeah this is like rock climbing Magnusson actually I didn't tell you that we got this before you can write no you didn't are you I do like it I love it no but it's cool yeah it's really nice I think that's not the best hole to place on right because it's a little bit tight here between the carabiner and your finger you know yeah but a smaller hole would be better if this was like here instead such like well be scripts 420blaze that had given us a carabiner that was smaller or a carabiner at all yeah maybe it would work better from your hole that's specifically designed for that thing but yeah or just little-boy or something yeah this product was designed for guys that can't actually rock climb like me and he still beats me in it I don't weigh you by a hundred pounds no those designed for rock climbers oh look at him look at him Co did you know this thing existed absolutely not it's not be able to do this so that Magnus is the winner  oh you're close  you know Nick is gonna be Mahan dudes a Boomer but we've already seen him arm-wrestle because this is the not first video I think we call Magnus on that and then go to go to other holds or unless you want to go up and wait um I mean we can go we can try a different it's Magnus he wants to go home I do want to go up and wait but I don't want to drag out your baby we're good go up and wait okay 150 pounds Magnus you weigh a hundred fifty pounds join his body weight Oh excellent reaction do do I was good it would be that easy for you yeah this is I want revenge  you're moving it let's add another 10 pounds just do the whole stack of weights we brought 9s Jesus 160 pounds per man yeah all right this is all we got guys so if he gets this and he's well I don't know we'll give you this thing Magnus okay oh this thing - yeah you cannot like I got a thing last time I know you get things everything you get everything from us waffles rock climbing grips subscribers haha [Music]  okay we're not going in and getting more weight now no that's fine so Jews you got 135 max got 160 we'll take note of that let's go to the next hold you what do you want to pick - cuz you want let's uh let's try this this is a very different hold because it's an open hand right this thing we crimped like this yeah this is an open hand wait you can fit four in there three okay Judy might not be able to fit yeah yeah you can't fit for two but it's very uncomfortable that way I didn't pick my yeah but it might actually be even though the pinky is a little bit weird yeah it might be the best way to hold this because you get an extra finger and also you Jam your hand in it kinda you know okay we'll see okay - yeah you've warmed up on this and uh how much do you think you're gonna get on this one yeah maybe fun Jude and ten Magnusson the correct answer is more than everyone else this is I mean this is a very different hold it's I open hand yeah I think Isaac will be good at this yeah that's small fingers that will suit the pocket right and yeah open hand you're going three yeah three Isaac you're going for I let's see you put those four fingers in that hole yeah Wow okay I think might have a distinct can you fit two in there or one uh I could fit you can fit three okay oh wait a minute just screw you guys okay no it hurts but I'm gonna do it anyway competition the winner what's the winner get the hold I don't know yeah you guys get the hold that we stole from this gym inter Peaks cool place would come again way too runny you guys work here I work here oh I used to work again so it's okay we steal a sovereign yeah I don't care I don't work here okay wait Nick you work here work here now all right if they ask us who stole it it's you you stole it oh no it's Magnus everybody loves Magnus so I'm leaving the country anyway Maggie's lost the suitcase so he stole a bunch of holds from the local rock climbing gym you like the four do you it's so tight you need to stack him like that so you're gonna do three I think so depends I don't know I don't know yet Isaac how many fingers are you gonna use or he's going to use for wow this is a different technique that's easy [Music]  hey yo we gotta go up a lot man yeah you're right you're right man you have a finger pump his fingers getting pumped okay cool oh he's trying to sing I can't get my why was it easy to get my fingers in before you want to hold on with your thumb but you can yeah that's the problem well the cool thing is we even have to tell anyone not to do that oh wow this is weird yeah yeah you jamming your yeah good Wow I suck nice I'll tell you man I'm getting a finger pump yeah you put your fingers you want to out angle the finger like flexor fingers for the good I have a lot of chalk I'm like here is that come on Ming nice Oh Magnus okay I'm gonna beat you there's no why I want to beat up so bad I've got to beat him somehow ahead I think I want to be Isaac - oh yeah yeah whoo Isaac your leaves are three fingers there yeah is it easier that way I can't tell hmm well we could just keep switching like just fidget around and see if it comes up yeah well you're up this is a is a blue square and a black diamond here for you I guess if we a green circle  whoa what them yeah I don't know my pinkie stronger than my that was cool that was your pinkie okay nuts do you have a lot of promises to give to the audience that thing from American Horror Story I did that a lot so I'm really strong it's crying for a bottle and you're gonna help you not give it to him oh good job that's drawing a salver I don't think I got this no 100 pounds let's see it lets see it [Music]  you got it oh well this is really hard wait Isaac give your toothbrush it's my last chance your last chance this is soap yeah the last chance the last resort is a toothbrush all right wow you brush your teeth with this I think this is how it works right you just put it in there you just don't want access okay yeah yeah blow it blow it blow it yeah you got it is that we just trolling me always all the dust out yeah  yeah really painful whoa I would rather do other things okay okay let's say you don't have to keep doing it thank you okay thanks will you give me something for that  oh yeah I can't even react anymore man no easy yeah but the thing is that one doesn't feel that great so we shouldn't go too high and I think that's a good way to enjoy yourself okay going to high level yeah because of the you don't get the full strength of your hand doing it it's like open open hand it feels bad for the tendons good thank you all right hundred pounds you got this is almost body weight with three fingers that would be really really crazy it's like an ant yes like an ant coming over here and lift in a pocket hold come on well  honestly this is a really good test of play finger strength between us and them in my opinion like this is really specific trying to make us an Austin then type video yeah we are us and they're them yeah Magnus is them Isaac you're them I want you to not say anything it's pretty pissed off at you all right but we're in a war and it's kind of my fault I got us into this war thing you know I know I'm sorry Tom but dude we take on a lot of rock climbers and this is it's got really hard really quickly okay let's go on to something a little more genuinely nice okay I'm just gonna pick the next one yeah if we want a more comfortable hole that would I would maybe go for this that's comfortable yeah this is like a half crimp probably something okay It's A Wrap as you can see as I pretty around it yeah yeah so I think for our fingers this one will be better guys this is all the way we brought over here let's do it this is a half crimp I I will hold it a half crimp okay this is most like the one that comes with the black one yeah it's 150  whoa someone needs to tighten up he'll bite you whoa whoa whoa where's the forearm measurement and where's the Titan bolt fingers were on the ledge and the ledge was it tightened by you and I fell off the ledge because of you I could have seriously injured my fingers where does the ledge it's right there trust him no I don't you tighten up pretty good brother yeah all right there you go 150 pounds yeah fairly hard okay wait one more try give me some chalk okay take your time what colors my face it's red okay it starts going white about 10 seconds later every time you do this be worried no no no I've seen it many times yeah I just do a real quick okay I did it  it's okay it's okay man can we just finish the video I mean I got this rock climbing hold because he's gonna be good at it okay it wasn't for you all right let's get the the other boys on this you guys want to try the 150 real quick okay Isaac how hard was that compared to the other list I felt like it was easier just cuz the whole it's a little deeper right I was able to get like at least one pad of each on the hold but it was harder because it weighs 44 pounds and you were right yeah [Music] oh man to be honest sometimes I think when Isaac is lifting John that it's less his finger strength that's failing and more his back and the rest of my body failed I would definitely agree with that yeah that is something you never thought about have you ever dead lifted 150 pounds you know that's an oddity someone not dead lifting and then just doing it one arm 100 pounds bad I've like dead lifted maybe once in my life Oh Nick you are so close Oh  dye your hair blond maybe you'll get it not again okay I gotta say that was actually one of the very very hardest feats of grip I've ever done really that was yeah it took every I'm like tired right now you look dead I mean that one plane like sumo games dead we're done we're gonna do the orange one and it will be done you don't worry don't worry okay you don't have to rock climb you get tall lift up heavy weights with rock climbing holds how much better is that okay is a lot better you're right okay right side okay the glass isn't half empty it's half tendonitis you got there I got an orange slice that's nice just nice looking it smells like a chalk  I'm Agnes we're gonna name this after you okay  the Agnes orange-peel feat of strength all right I'm just gonna stop maybe stop sometime in you know sometimes it is so arrogant I know camera two I'm sorry I wish you would just be humble like yeah off camera yes I'll try come on if you were this you can move to Florida okay I need I give up you being my enemy in this video now I need your help come on are you lifting I like this or like this Shawna you got to lift this on your own this okay I need agrees okay John I've got the least for a 2-bedroom duplex in Orlando if you get this come on man it's a duplex there's one bath where your finger spreader together together dude is it steps away from Disney World like 25 minutes Wow that's it did you rip it no okay that's good I feel like it's a men in black though when I lose my finger prints oh your memory doesn't get erase just a fingerprint both I don't forget fill these John you wanna you didn't lift any of these weights want to start the video again  all right let's give Isaac a try here oh  wow your your budging that the stack goes up to his knee position yeah gady give him the good carabiner come on Magnus car con you Magnus Isaac oh yeah your parents only put one a in your name get the other way by getting this left oh wow you're bubs now that's big [Music] oh and all right Magnus what did we learn from this video have we learned anything I think we have I think you excelled at grip implements when they weren't even geared towards rock climbing so then when there was a rock climbing geared implement yeah you did really well with it yeah this is more applicable than a pinch block to a rock coming home but it's nice it's a nice tool I mean it's very measurable this is yeah okay would you actually use it to Train uh yeah would yes sure I mean that's a good way to do some just measure progression I think okay we'll make one for you oh thank you that's a little different than theirs nice [Music] it's okay guys there's a Scholastic Book Fair at the entrance go get some books don't worry guys  John you'll get better grip when it's not here to rock climbing doing  [Music] [Applause] [Music]  you [Music]", "njM2swbICYg": "intermittent fasting can be a little bit different for you when you're over 40 now I'm not saying you're old by any stretch of imagination okay when you're over 40 just hormones are a little bit different there's different enzymatic fluctuations that we have to account for so all this means is that we make these small little changes to our intermittent fasting lifestyles and we can have just as much success as people that are younger than us so here's the thing you probably know someone that's in their 20s or 30s and is doing intermittent fasting they're having all this success and they want you to do it alongside them well you might not get the same results if you just follow their exact protocol so the purpose of this video is to give you little things that you can apply to your intermittent fasting lifestyle that'll help you out if you're over the age of 40 this isn't a meal plan I'm not going to give you exactly what to eat what I am going to give you is tips and tricks they're gonna make your fasting lifestyle a lot easier I'm gonna talk about what you should be doing while you're fasting how often you should fast how long you should fast for I'm gonna talk about specific foods that you can get some benefit out of during your actual eating period I'm gonna talk about some supplements that you can take that will help you out and I'm just going to give you some overall knowledge it's gonna make you a lot more powerful when you're embarking on an intermittent fasting lifestyle you're tuned into the Internet's leading performance nutrition and fat loss channel we have new videos on Tuesdays Fridays and Sundays at 7 a.m. Pacific time but we also release videos just about every single day nowadays why don't you go ahead and hit that little red subscribe button but I also want you to go ahead and turn on that little bell button so you turn on notifications it'll make it so you always know whenever I post a new video like this so without further ado let's just go ahead and get into this okay this is gonna be some good stuff and I want you to stick with me through the entirety the first thing I want to talk about is how often you should fast okay so people that are younger they can get away with fasting more frequently now what I mean by that is people that are in their 20s and 30s they can usually do what is called a 16-8 fasting period okay now that is great and it works well and does work well for people over 40 too but hear me up the sixteen eight fasting period basically that tells you that you fast for sixteen hours and then you have an eight hour period of eating and you generally do that every single day that just butt your new pattern of eating but as you get older you actually get more benefit out of fasting for slightly longer periods of time three to four times per week so we're talking about maybe doing a 20-hour fast three times per week or maybe four times per week now the reason behind this is a couple of things for one you're gonna get more of what's called a telomere response the longer the fast the more anti-aging potential you get someone in their 20s and 30s doesn't really need a whole lot of anti-aging effect I mean sure they can benefit from it but once you're over 40 you can get a powerful effect from the anti-aging side now by anti aging I mean cellular anti-aging I don't just mean looking good and looking pretty I mean actually increasing our telomere length which is a component of our DNA that ultimately unravels as we get older I'm gonna save you the details on that but essentially if we restore our telomere length and we have more stem cells through longer periods of fasting we can essentially live longer and fight off disease for a longer period of time but the big reason that a lot of you are probably watching this video is body composition now as you get a little bit older if you were to fast every single day and restrict your calories every single day you have more of a potential to slow down your metabolism and someone that is younger does so for example someone that's twenty-five or thirty they could fast every single day and they could limit their calories every single day and not have as much of a metabolism slowed down because of the restricted calories as someone over 40 would so it's better to have a normal level of calories one day and then an aggressively reduced level of calories that next so basically instead of gradually reducing your calories or staying low all the time you're gonna do more of a regular calorie maintenance to keep your metabolism high and then you're gonna drop your calories aggressively on a longer fast like twenty twenty-one hours and then go back up the next day so I recommend fasting every other day if you're over 40 you just seem to get more benefit and the clients that I've worked with like they just can't deny the results people get better results that way now is there a lot of medical reason and research backed reason kind of but it's still up in the air this is just what I've seen now there was one study that took a look at 30 females that were at least 49 years of age ranging all the way up to 57 years of age now what they found with this age group is that they responded better to longer term fast now we're talking like one to two days plus in this case but the point was they had increased levels of adeno pectin they had lower LDL levels and they just ended up having better health overall so older populations again I'm not putting you in an older population category I'm just saying that people that are over 40 tend to respond a little bit better from a health perspective to it longer fast the other big thing that we have to look at this is good for men and women is human growth hormone increases only really come into play with fasting when they're longer fasts so sure a 16 hour fast if you're doing typical 16:8 might have some benefit when it comes to growth hormone surges but a longer fast is really where you're gonna get the powerful effect human growth hormone is everything when you're a little bit older yeah when you're over 40 human growth hormone is what's gonna make your skin look fresh it's gonna be what's allowing you to build muscle what's gonna allow you to recover it's going to allow you to feel young this is very important and you need to have those longer fast so I would rather you end up having these longer fasts a few times per week than shorter fast you need to go for more of the metabolic benefit versus just the caloric restriction trust me the results will be better long-term so let's go ahead and let's talk a little bit about what you should be consuming or not consuming during your fast during your fasting period things are simple honestly this goes for anyone that's 15 years old 20 years old 30 years old 40 years older 50 60 whatever okay while you're fasting you should keep it simple I always say K is s keep it simple stupid that's the way you want to do it if you start over complicating it you'll drive yourself crazy so for all intents and purposes water black coffee black tea green tea that's really it okay I mean sure you could get down to the idiosyncrasies of different diet sodas and stuff like that but just keep it simple honestly it's just way easier now that's going to go for everybody but some specific things that you might need to be paying attention to if you're over 40 you're going to want to increase your sodium level more so than someone else now you might be thinking Thomas sounds crazy I'm gonna turn this video off right now I'm older why would I want to increase my blood pressure with more sodium well first of all sodium does not always equate to higher levels of chronically high levels of blood pressure okay it's more about insulin more about sugar there's a whole nother rabbit-hole we could go down there sodium plays a very big role in overall sending an electrical signal through our body and when we're fasting we need that to occur we need that electrical signal otherwise our electrolytes get out of whack and we don't get the benefit of fasting and as you get older the nervous system isn't quite what it used to be which means we're relying more on healthy minerals to get the job done so unless you want to feel fatigued and a little bit stiff during your fast then you're gonna want to have some sodium in the equation so make sure you're getting a high quality sodium we're talking like Himalayan pink salt some Celtic sea salt some redmond real salt one of those don't go for just regular iodized salt okay go for the good stuff whenever you possibly can and I will give you some numbers here you usually want to have like one teaspoon per half gallon of water so we're not talking like a crazy amount but we're talking enough to at least keep you hydrated okay hydration is key this next tip for when you're fasting is a very big one very important for people that are over 40 and it has to do with catecholamines which are our adrenaline or epinephrine things like that all right if you consume caffeine like coffee or tea consolidate it to the morning okay normally if you're younger you're okay to have caffeine throughout the entirety of the day during your fast and I'm not saying that you're gonna absolutely blow all the benefits if you do have caffeine through the entirety but you will get better results and you'll feel better and here's why as you get older you're more sensitive to your catecholamines you're more sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine and things like that now that's a good thing in some ways because intermittent fasting is ultimately giving you an adrenaline rush you're not eating so your body goes into sort of a starvation kind of fight-or-flight mode so your catecholamines are already high your adrenaline is already high well caffeine spikes your adrenaline even higher what you don't want to have happen is have your adrenaline spike so high for such a long period of time because you're consuming caffeine along with your entire fast that you end up burning out your adrenals the adrenal fatigue is a real thing okay adrenal fatigue isn't recognized by the medical community as an actual diagnosis but there is something that's recognized by the medical community such as adrenal insufficiency and that's very similar it's just kind of different terms right the point is is if you have too much caffeine throughout the entirety of the day while you're fasting you can give yourself some adrenal fatigue that can wreak havoc for you later on down the line and make it so you're chronically tired if you consolidate your caffeine in the morning you get a big rush of catecholamines when your body is supposed to have them and also when you're most susceptible to burning fat so if you're gonna have caffeine allocated to the morning and then go ahead and let yourself kind of wean off of it throughout the course of the day you just have to have some faith in me on this one trust me it makes a lot of sense when you look at the research this next tip is one that goes for everybody and that is to workout in a fasted state now if you're over 40 one of the things you might be concerned about is am I gonna wear myself out like I'm tired and I'm fasting should I really be working out the answer is yeah you really should be you don't have to push it to the limit but you're going to get a lot more benefit out of working out in a fasted State now those of you that know my channel you're saying Thomas you sound like a broken record talking about this all the time well just respect the fact there's a lot of people watching this video that haven't watched my other videos okay when you work out in a fasted state you recruit what are called intra Maya cellular lipids these are fat droplets that are actually in your muscle cells or not in your muscle cells but next your muscle fibers now when you work out in a fasted state you burn those up so you actually burn two to three times as much in the way of intra - cellular lipids sometimes even more if you workout in a fasted state the benefit to someone that's over 40 here is you can get by with working out at a lower intensity Wow Thomas just say that working out at a lower intensity yeah I mean heck if you can do the most with the least go for it you might as well preserve your body it's not all about going balls to the wall every single day so if you can get more out of your workout by training in a fasted state and not have to push your body's the limit where you're breaking down and can't even hang out with your kids or grandkids yeah I'd say that you shouldn't be doing that right you want to be not you want to not push your body you want to be able to push it to an extent where you can still recover so train in the morning in your fasted state now we're gonna talk a little bit about things that you shouldn't take during your fast okay it comes up a lot people talk about taking vitamins and supplements I recommend just keeping them out of the equation okay now there's always the exception so bear with me because no matter what the situation there's always me someone who has a particular supplement or a nootropic or something they want to take while they're fasting and I get it and that's okay but for the sake of this video is to keep it simple just keep supplements out of the equation but especially keep antioxidants out of the equation like vitamin C and vitamin E and fish oil while you're fasting those are great supplements but while you're fasting they negate the effects of the fast you have to remember that when we are fasting we're trying to stress our body out we're trying to elicit a stress response vitamin C is an antioxidant which means it actually acts as a crutch for your body studies have shown I don't recall the exact research journal but studies have shown in multiple occasions that taking vitamin C and vitamin E during a fast actually hurts the metabolic effect of the fast the fast should be difficult so just bear with it it's gonna be tough but you don't need to take vitamin C because you think it's going to boost your immune system it actually does the opposite let the fasting help your immune system naturally don't give it a crutch okay okay now let's move into breaking the fast okay because really during the fast things are simple but breaking the fast gets a little bit more particular now everyone should be breaking a fast in a similar way and my philosophy behind breaking a fast is break your fast with a smallish meal okay small meal and then have a larger meal one to two hours later maybe even up to three hours later break your fast with something small controlled lean and high in protein the reason that I say this is because for the most part it's an emotional thing you break your fast and then you're not going to be susceptible to just raiding the pantry if you can control this one meal control this one meal and you break it fast it makes the rest if you're eating periods so much easier you're not gonna run in the house and raid the pantry I can't tell you how many times has happened to me or people I know at the end of a fast I'm so hungry and I wasn't prepared and I walk in the house and I just end up just you know food coming with coma in the pantry it's just not good right so if you have something controlled and then you eat a little bit later it's gonna work a lot better now for the older populations at all anyone 40s 50s 60s 70s on it you're gonna want to have higher levels of protein okay you might be thinking this seems like it's harder on my kidneys right now the protein situation with the kidneys that's a gray area we don't need to go there we have a bigger problem and that's atrophy okay atrophy is related to illness atrophy is the muscle breakdown the catabolism the breakdown of the muscle tissue when we get sick we have atrophy atrophy is linked with people just ultimately aging and dying we want to maintain our muscle but we also want to maintain our muscle because that's the biggest driving force behind our metabolism as we get older we do not preserve our muscle as much we need more protein it's more important as we get older so what I recommend is when you break your fast eat 25 to 35 percent of your body weight in grams of protein okay now that sounds complicated 11 you're like giving you an example if there is a 200-pound person 25% of 200 pounds would be 50 pounds so you should eat 50 grams of protein so you basically take 1/4 of your body weight in pounds and eat one gram of protein per pound okay so a 200 pound person 50 grams protein okay that's gonna be straightforward so when you break your fast this is pretty much all you need to have like lean protein okay don't try to dress it up with a bunch of sauces and things like that you can you can season it you can even add a couple veggies if you want to but I highly recommend honestly just keeping it lean protein I know it's bland I know it's boring but you can do it for one meal imagine this you just broke your fast or you just ended your fast and you had your little bit of protein and then an hour or two hours later you can go to dinner and you can actually enjoy a regular meal and not have to think anything of it simply because you already ate you're breaking the fast meal next up is you have to pay a lot more attention to prebiotic fibers make sure that you're getting in a lot of artichoke a lot of asparagus a lot of the veggies that have prebiotic fibers prebiotic fibers are the fur of our gut bacteria and when we go through a fasting period a lot of our gut bacteria dies off okay what happens is the stronger healthier bacteria tends to thrive so what happens is at the end of the fast we're usually left with a good amount of good bacteria we want to feed that and regular veggies do some benefit there but prebiotics are the big thing so we have to get those prebiotics in so what I recommend is with the second meal try to get some artichokes in try to get some asparagus in try to get some bok choy and try to get a little bit of cabbage these things play a big role and artichokes specifically promote what are called bile salts so when you're fasting a lot of times your gall bladder and your liver stop producing bile for a little bit or they slow down on the production of it so then when you eat something that's fatty or even remotely fatty you have a hard time digesting it so what you want to do is you want to eat things like artichokes because they literally do promote bile activity they promote bile salts so they promote this that there's basically bile salts are an emulsifier so what they do is they promote that and that allows us to break it down break down those fats and absorb them easier very important for you you don't want to end up being someone that doesn't digest fats very well because then a you don't get the benefit of those fats but be you can have a lot of digestive discomfort this next tip is a big one on your fasting days okay whether you are low carb or not you should really avoid grains I know I know it sucks like I'm telling you that I told you earlier you can have so much flexibility and things like that but just hear me out on this you don't have to abide by this one I'm just trying to give you what you can use to have optimal results so grains have something called WGA s these WGA s are called wheat germ I'm gluten inspector a glutton ends or WGA s what they are are they're basically glycoproteins that stick together so you've heard of people that have gluten intolerances or celiac disease right where they they really have an anti like an actual autoimmune inflammatory issue where their body's own anti inflammatory system or immune system is really having a hard time just breaking down gluten well that's because essentially the gluten is triggering an immune response within that person well believe it or not grains like rice and corn and barley and rye these things all have these WGA s in them which means that when they get into our system they clump together and when they clump together they end up causing an inflammatory reaction because they don't break down so what happens is we end up with what's called a leaky gut where these big clumps of food essentially are getting into our bloodstream and our immune system attacks them why is this so important on a fasting day because on a fasting day you are sensitive to what you eat so if you eat grains that's fine I just recommend on a fasting day that when you do break your fast you don't have those grains try to get rid of them so try to avoid grains we're talking rye we're talking barley we're talking rice we're talking corn we're talking quinoa even these so-called healthy grains they can cause this issue for you and this can be really really unhealthy and really really unpleasant and you may not even realize it until you take them away and realize how good you feel some of the starches and the carbs you really could get away with Mura are gonna be start just like the potatoes so we're lacking like even red potatoes white potatoes is gonna be fine we're talking things like sweet potatoes okay we've got plantains we've got beets we've got parsnips okay we've got a lot of these healthier starches that are coming that way cassava you can have a lot of these things and they're not going to be bad okay now there's a lot of gluten-free options out there that don't even use grains nowadays so again I understand you might be going out to eat you might be having some fun there whatever it's not like this has to be the gospel all the time yeah you can have grains I'm just saying in the ideal situation try to just keep the grains out it's easier on your body next up switch your proteins out don't have the same protein every day when you break your fast or even with your meals later on again it comes down to a diverse bacteria in your gut if you feed your gut one type of food over and over again one type of bacteria is going to grow and other types of bacteria are going to go them down so we need to try to diversify so we're constantly feeding other kinds of bacteria so just switch your proteins out if you usually do whey protein try a pea protein if you usually do chicken try to go for beef you know try to switch it up as much as you possibly can and then lastly when it comes down to choosing your meat sources and everything like that try to get some things in the way of saturated fat saturated fat is not gonna be a bad thing for you let me give you a quick breakdown on what happened with saturate fat why doing things it's bad I'm gonna make this quick people think the saturated fat clogs up in your arteries and that it's just big globs of fat that stick and tied your arterial wall and give you a heart attack not the case at all okay what happens is inflammation which is a result moreso of sugar and stress causes an immune response which triggers an LDL receptor to become inflamed within our artery then what happens is our immune system sends white blood cells and the white blood cells go to the artery and they accumulate and then and only then the saturated fat start to cause an issue because then it causes a plaque and that plaque is what causes the actual problem or the myocardial infarction or the heart attack right or the stroke so it's not about the saturated fat it's about the inflammation well one of the fastest ways to combat inflammation is through an intermittent fasting or ketogenic lifestyle so honestly get healthy eat the healthy fats and you'll be good because the saturated fats are going to be really good for what's called your myelin yeah your your nerves have a sheath on the outside of them called the myelin sheath and this myelin sheath is critical for overall nerve signaling okay first cell transit are for signal transduction so actually sending a signal from your brain down to your toes whatever it needs to be we need that if the myelin is broken the nerve signal cannot be completed okay that proton that gradient can't be created between the sodium potassium okay that lie on exchange complicated we're not going to go that route there's also lots of little things that you could eat like for example I highly recommend eating seaweed believe it or not so we're talking about getting iodine from seaweed the thyroid needs iodine to create t3 to create thyroid hormone okay the thyroid is critical and I mean critical for your metabolism so don't ever just ignore it eat the seaweed or get some iodine somehow okay a lot of times they put iodine in salt but the hard part is salt that is iodized is usually low-quality table salt so by the way if there's little snacks and things that you want that are safe during an intermittent fasting or ketogenic lifestyle I want you to go ahead and check out thrive market I went ahead and I put a link down in the description below so in the description after you watch this video you'll see a link for thrive market and I've been able to create a specific keto and fasting bundle okay so what that means is thrive market is something where you can go online and you can get your groceries shipped right to your doorstep so you don't have to go to the grocery store and you can ultimately save a bunch of money because it's cheaper than the grocery store plus you don't have to drive there so I've worked a thrive for a while so I've created specific bundles so if you click down in the link below again after this video you'll get the Thomas tool our Kido or fasting bundles which is my select foods for you if you're doing an intermittent fasting lifestyle these are snack foods things that you can enjoy during your eating period so after you're done fascinating you're kind of questioning what you can eat what you can't eat I highly recommend that you check them out plus they're just cheaper in the grocery store so if you like your groceries and you like them delivered right to your doorstep you're gonna want to check out thrive okay so let's go ahead and now let's talk a little bit more about supplements for a second okay supplements keep to a minimum now I could go on and on about all different kinds of supplements but I think we want to keep it basic if you're a male I want you to consume boron okay you only need like six to nine milligrams of boron per day now what boron is going to do is going to help you unlock bound-up testosterone to make it free testosterone we have testosterone in our bodies but most of it is bound up with what's called sex hormone binding globulin sex hormone binding globulin takes up 98 to 99 percent of our overall testosterone in the body and binds it to this literally a globulin meaning it's not usable in the body boron has been shown to unlock and release some of that sex hormone binding globulin so if you're a male you're going to get more muscle mass you're going to get more overall energy you're gonna get more strength they're gonna get more libido it's going to help you out immensely so you definitely want to get lots of boron as much as you can in a healthy way you can also get it through specific foods also that are down in that thrive link that's down below so make sure you check them out additionally for men and women believe it or not saw palmetto it's very very good now saw palmetto has long been thought only to be something for prostate support for men but it actually has some benefits for women too so men you're gonna want to take a higher amount women you can get by with less but men what saw palmetto is going to do is it's going to help slow down the conversion of testosterone into what's called dihydrotestosterone or DHT now what DHT does in your body is it enlarges your prostate so it's a hyperplasia so it's something we don't want it's what makes you feel like you have to urinate all the time and it can even lead to some forms of prostate cancer so this is just me looking out actually whether you're fasting keto or whatever I do recommend that you take saw palmetto so I'm just throwing that in there all right then we want to look at coenzyme q10 coenzyme q10 is everything when it comes to energy I recommend it for a lot of people but if you're over 40 it becomes very important and it becomes extremely important when you are doing intermittent fasting not during your fast but just overall on the lifestyle you see what's happening is you're consolidating eating windows which means your body has to become ruthlessly efficient at utilizing nutrients now what coenzyme q10 does is it helps take energy like electrons from the food that we eaten and takes it to electron acceptors within the cell so basically it is like the shuttle bus it's like you drove to the baseball game right you got to the parking lot but you had to park really far away but fortunately there's a shuttle that just takes you to the rest of the get to the game so you can actually enjoy it right it's like you went the 99% but you need that shuttle to get you in it's like the escort so coke q10 is very powerful and you don't always have to take a supplement with coke q10 but let me finish explaining what else is happening with coq10 inside our mitochondria our mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell it's where we create energy okay so without the mitochondria we wouldn't ever be able to create adenosine triphosphate or actually create the spark that gives us energy what Co Q 10 does is it transfers energy from the outer membrane of the mitochondria to the inner membrane and it creates what is called a proton gradient now it's complex again but that proton gradient is what allows energy to occur it's all about creating a gradient so electrical energy can transfer and ultimately create energy and what's called the phosphorylation process where anyway complex coq10 is good you don't always have to take a supplement if you take a supplement 300 600 milligrams of solid otherwise eat lots of fatty fish so we're talking about good healthy salmon halibut things like that also organ meats I know that isn't always fun for people to think about but liver kidney heart if you're into that you really really good stuff and it comes down to coq10 and it's probably most bioavailable form that you can get so if you're into that I mean you can make a sauce out of it or something please go right ahead additionally broccoli cauliflower and spinach are pretty high in coq10 nowhere near as high as the animal sources but if you're not into consuming all cuts of animal meat then sure you can just load up on the spinach or load up on the broccoli you're gonna get an anti estrogen effect from the broccoli - which is very powerful for men over 40 and for women okay so broccoli contains something known as dim D Ndola methane talked about this a lot in my videos again sound like a broken record for those of you that are used to my channel but D end all methane derived from broccoli and cauliflower helps the liver metabolize estrogen it helps metabolize that one seven hydroxy estrogens the bad estrogens and helps convert them into a healthy usable form or a form that our body can emulsify along with bile and break down and excrete out of the body so eat your broccoli okay there's one last really important thing okay and this is something that some people will tell you you never need to do and this is like the die-hard fasters that never want to take a break okay this is called taking a diet break and this isn't a cheat meal okay because when you're intermittent fasting in a lot of ways you're kind of cheating almost every day it's like you're going a period of time without eating and then you're kind of binging I mean that maybe not binging a lot of times you're under control but in some ways you are eliciting that cheat meal response so we're not looking for a cheat meal we're looking for a diet break and this is even more important when it comes down to any older population heck anyone over 35 to be completely honest now there is a cool study that was called the matador study now the matador study was an acronym it stood for minimizing adaptive thermogenesis and reducing obesity REBOUND complicated acronym okay what that means is when we diet we have a pretty severe decrease in our metabolism it happens it doesn't take long either takes like three to five sometimes six weeks for a metabolism to slow as much as 28% when we reduce our calories now when we're intermittent fasting a lot of the benefits are coming from hormonal changes and different things that we're doing with growth hormone and stuff like that but but a lot of the benefit is still coming from just simple calorie restriction we're not eating as much because we're consolidating our food too one period of time so our calories are being restricted which means that we are not immune to this overall metabolic slowdown now this study this mattador study it took a look at what happens when you actually have people take a diet break for one to two weeks so they took two groups of individuals one group did 16 weeks of continuous dieting another group did 16 weeks of dieting but it was broken up every few weeks with a one to two week diet break okay so both groups ultimately still had the same diet for 16 weeks just one group took breaks and one group did not well the overall results were pretty amazing the group that took the breaks ended up having significantly more muscle and significantly less body fat because their body had a chance to get the metabolism back up now the whole purpose of our metabolism slowing down is to preserve our bodies see that we're hurting we're not eating so it slows down our metabolism so one cheat meal doesn't solve the problem you need to replicate what's really happening like in real life and what's what would really happen in real life is you might go a week or two of back to normal eating not a surplus but normal eating so go for five six weeks with your intermittent fasting lifestyle aggressively and then take a week of no fasting or maybe even two weeks of no fasting where you make sure you get back up to a normal maintenance level that way when you do or if you do ever go off of fasting or get your calories back up you're not going to rebound okay you're not going to have that obesity rebound that the mattador study was ultimately trying to you know fix its adaptive thermogenesis it's a totally normal thing we just have to stay ahead of the curve so this breaks down intermittent fasting over 40 I appreciate your time and also please please even if it's just a matter of checking them out please check out thrive down in the description because they didn't help make this video possible and they did allow me to create this awesome bundle for everybody and at the very least do it as a thank you to me for creating this video just go check them out as always if you have ideas for future videos make sure you put them down in the comment section I'll see you soon", "AH4mGMG8OgQ": "okay team we literally have 20 minutes yeah first off why is your favorite movie we've covered this you know today we didn't talk about it but I just want to get the accent now oh my favorite well yesterday we were talking about snatch that's one of my favorite movies but actually Fight Club is one of my older favorite movies that's what crossed with mayhem was actually named after his Fight Club so yeah you know Project Mayhem crossed with mayhem that's right so he came from  Preston did not come up with any my cousin Preston tries to take credit for it but he didn't it was me in there so when we were younger Darren who's the head coach here the winningest coach in CrossFit Games History Month you know besides Chang his oldest brother and myself were best friends and so our favorite movie at the time was Fight Club and then when he passed away we kinda did it as a tribute to him so that's why it's CrossFit man like so I was blown away yesterday when he did his accent I thought there was someone else different in the room so this is from snatch okay take it away which what a which which clip do you want me to just anyone with no swearing you're like thanks you like Dex Oh dogs yeah I like eggs English words into American what is chopped chopped put it into a sentence chop something you eat or is that when you're mad I don't know put in a sentence I'm really chuffed off what's a cuppa a copper yeah put it into a sentence oh I want to I want to cover yeah okay okay okay say it in English copper cup up nah not good McAdoo yes the napkin ba growl bog bog roll chin wag chin wag you should shave your chin wag  and that is all for the English actually I so I heard Jake one of our friends invited you guys back for a fourth of July yeah and he didn't understand why you guys didn't celebrate fourth of July  he's like wait you guys don't suck no no it's kind of an American thing Kristen sure if you want to have some fun ask him about his worst CrossFit Games event many think it was the rope climb that cost him the 2010 games but it was actually his walking triple three it was pretty embarrassing I've had a couple different embarrassing moments at the CrossFit Games let's be honest there was in 2011 ern\u00c3\u00b5 2010 the rope rope climb obviously 2011 I actually walked on the beach sand run it really was doing great through the first half the second run crushed me it's soft sand was awful twelve I don't think I had any major hiccups 13 was pretty pretty good and then 14 love the walking on triple 3 yeah that wasn't me stuff like four times yeah or more but there the thing is I still beat some other guys walking were you trying to keep with kelipah that's why I heard the story was he went hot on the Dublin driving well I mean he's such a good rower I mean I knew I couldn't like keep up with him on the row on double honours I don't think it would be that big of an issue I mean I I was I was spent I was went out too hot on the run and then was it was super hot that day and it was either pass out or walk until I decided to walk some other people the next year on Murph decided to pass out and then your games is ruined so it was it was hot it was certain it was like your like pavement godless about going through that workout it was so and I was like it is actually wearing black nano fives Air Force of course so trying to run him that it was before actually I like working with Chris he said in triple three it significantly put you down the leaderboard this ultimately led to a pivotal conversation with Hillary later in the weekend this conversation proves without question that Hillary is the person in charge of the relationship that was actually in 13 that didn't go with that it was in 13 when Jason won I did Terra won that was another embarrassing moment at the games of pool that did awful in that event it was like 27 at 27th in that event Jason did pretty well he won the both rows and then he won the burden run and so after that I was in like a 200 point hole I think I was in fourth or third or something like that I was just being a baby I feel sorry for myself and we're sitting in the back then we're in the stadium at StubHub and Hillary came down in the athlete area and we're just sitting there talking and I was just being a baby and she looks at me and she goes well if you're not having fun let's just go home I was like what are you talking about she said she goes just tell Dave get your stuff just tell Dave you're leaving I was like yeah I'm gonna tell Dave that I'm leaving the CrossFit Games just cuz I'm not having fun and so she's like well you better just start having fun then so there we go starting around from there does she wear the trousers most most of the time yes yeah I'm not gonna lie we've seen it a little bit yeah what was your first car ever my first car ever was in the Zuzu hombre so is it basically it's an s10 so a Chevy s10 small truck small pickup truck it was actually like we call me to meet her man trucks so like people that go check the electrical meters on this it had an actual sticker that was removed so remove some of the paint I actually learned how to drive on a 69 c10 pickup truck and that's why I thought my first truck was gonna be but it was that subtle tantrum yeah in some country so you've done a lot right you've been all over the world yep with this water boys what is left on your bucket list what do you want to do is there something you don't mind that you're like oh yeah I do want to go to Australia yeah there's got to be something that you're like you're like ah before maybe my career is done or after my career there's something that I really want to dive into it I just do it all right just pretty content children I like where we're at I would like to race a car yeah like goes some driving school or something like that yeah we were talking yesterday and Edinboro is one of the coolest places that I've been and I want to go back where I actually have some time I mean I as bad as it sounds I like being at home you know I get to hang out with these guys and I'm kind of a homebody I do enjoy getting once I get to places I like being there but getting there's the you know the airport and all that stuff that's the that's the hard part of it what's the best piece of advice that you've been given first what something this stuck with you over these years of being the top dog what was the what someone told you something in you in yep that's it my grandfather or my dad I mean I don't think you know words for me are just words usually I think it's more like seeing how hard my parents work both my mom and my dad my grandparents as well all of my family so just I'm not really a I'm not a motivational quote guy I don't you know I don't look into that stuff too much I just its lead by example and that's you know kind of the way I was brought up that was the leadership style Mike both of my parents had and so that's this is the the leadership style that I have it's not really know if there's ever really one piece of advice that's been given other than just a whole collection of you know actions by my parents lead by example has been one thing that I've seen since you've been here yeah that's why we're doing the workout so you always finish personal you're always go in that chair the whole team are still working and you just sit there in the chair hey watch the person who's watching that's pretty cool do you use emojis I was when you message us I don't get an emoji I don't know if you like me or debuts yes I don't really use emojis the American flag and the eagle and sometimes the middle finger are the only yes are the emoji said I use I think that was happy with that yes yeah yeah so I I speak in gifts usually though what is your go-to track like you're like you need to get pumped up you've got a 5 minute workout you want a 5 minute track what do you what is rich Froning good upon um I mean everybody knows that that when they watch our videos they're kind of like you guys listen to worship music for me  fierce by Christian stanphill it's a it's a Christian song but it really it gives me fired up gets you out ya know set of fires also another good one are you a good cook I can grill yeah tears come around to your house and so wait what do you cook us steak some sweet potato fries can you nail sweet potato fries because the majority of let's get them soggy well well you've got a greaseless deep fryer well it's a airfryer's that's where it's at next time you come do you have a jack do I have a joke no another phone gave I've always told us about the pig one oh yeah what kind of what kind of I'm very kind of bread we're kind of bread the pigs eat wheat wheat [Laughter] such a day I love dad jokes two elephants koala form alright no reaction  I've seen it for myself over the over the last couple days but what's your usual training light because for me it just seems like you're in the hall there yeah yeah he's because your barn is right like it Barney yeah it's the house yeah I mean we can work out pretty much whenever we want so it's nice um yeah I mean throughout the week it's usually we meet up team meets up about 9:00 9:30 we may start with some type of interval we may start with swim or whatever it is and then usually work out till about 12:00 12:30 1:00 o'clock ish break for an hour or two and then trying to get about 3:30 or so it's like a full workday yeah pretty much pretty much we're using it for time with Roman stuff do you get stopped stripped by people or is this someone that you want to meet um you know I I'd love to meet the rock I would love to meet the rock yeah that would be a corn to meet I grew up my childhood hero was Barry Sanders we actually have a fat head of him in our office and I would like to meet him what baby in a second I'm almost done yeah we need the time this is this is all the time so literally all the time what he's not working out this is Iseman where's the five minutes go see what Dan is doing real quick and I'll be ready you're stranded on a desert island with two Games athletes who do you choose apart from Dan Bailey and Josh bridges is Facundo you know for kundo right okay so he does this all the time this is his game and we joked that if you had jason khalipa he would somehow come up with a way to sell the bananas or coconuts to the monkeys or whoever is on the island to make some type of business out of it so but no I mean me Josh josh is obviously a no-brainer bridges cuz means ex-navy seal you want somebody like that good for comedic relief most of the time yeah trying to think of another one Ames athlete that I don't know you guys a survival with skills yeah I mean you guys do come from Australia but one event you could go back and do real in swim I wanted this one event with the pool because I did so terrible on it that I am wait a much better shot yeah someone still bothers me do you eat pizza oh yeah Oh Pizza yeah you do do you have pineapple on your pizza I don't mind pineapple on my pizza only have it not regularly no that's not that's not my like that's not like my first choice but I would eat it do you get nervous you want those people not like I guess it's compared you know when you go into competition and like a lot of people just get nervous before you go into competition do you get those nerves or you go on the floor for sure yeah how detailed every detail with them I think you just kind of use it you channel it and use it for what to make you go harder make you go faster I mean if you didn't you know every time I get out there I'm like why do I do this this feeling's awful but then you know in the middle of it you enjoy it and at the end of it you're glad you did it but man yeah super nervous we haven't gone three times when you doubted yourself yeah all the time every time almost every of that you're like man I can I hold whatever pace I think I'm gonna hold you know it's so-and-so gonna go faster yeah so I mean yeah you're gonna there's gonna be some doubt that creeps in there but you just kind of deal with it and push through it okay so you head you know when you do an event like some people like me I think when I'm going through the yeah some people say they died oh yeah for sure there's always always some type of for me is you know everybody kind of says why I just you know I still get my own head and I you know try to do my my thing and don't worry about everybody else but I think you have to worry about everybody else and you have to watch everybody else and I think that's where the sport comes in to to play is you have to kind of you know if you know so in somebody's better at something or certain movement you know you don't wanna let them get too far ahead can you catch them on the next thing or they are they going out too hard can you see them sir suffer a little bit you do know can they keep that pace there's a lot of things going on in my head usually when you know it's a little bit different now on team you're kind of watching your teammates more than you're watching everybody else but you're still kind of taken you got to step back a little bit and be present enough to know what's going on I mean if you're true competitor and you want to one win you've got to do those things you love the avenges I love the adventure so if you could be one of the Avengers which one would you be oh man I'd guide man Iron Man yeah I mean obviously Captain America would be a good one he dies off in there he does die you know so yeah I'm getting old so you know that's I don't know if it's confirmed it's in all the leaks so maybe they you know maybe they threw that leak out there for you too yeah Captain America I did really like this last thor ragnarok and Thorpe became pretty cool in that one before that was like a Thor's alright but now I'm like it was pretty cool so that's good yeah just to let you guys know rich Froning does not play pokemon go I do not play but he is excited for the Pokemon movie I do kind of watch it right well that's fine dude you know a good movie I think checking you would ever make a movie apart from the movie that you've already made but like from that movie if the Avengers came to you as head absolutely we won't be in the Avengers I would love to yeah of course that would be cool idea anything I mean growing up I always wanted to play professional baseball like that was my my thing now it's like there's so much travel involved in that that would be tough I mean any professional sport I would love to do hockey I really enjoyed playing hockey the last couple years that we we started playing hockey yeah something like some sport yeah I just um I grew up you know I told story all-time I'm one of 32 first cousins on my mom side and 25 of us her boy so it was just competition constantly and so I think I have to do something where I compete what's the worst job you've ever had uh had some badge I was an exterminator so like I crawled in under houses and sprayed for bugs I did that when I was a firefighter on my off days with one of the guys that was my lieutenant or here's my engineer I did that I washed and waxed houseboats which sounds like a great job because you're at the lake all the time but it's terrible because everybody's going out to have fun you're washing and waxing houseboats it was terrible but yeah exterminator wasn't the most fun job I ever did what's the funniest thing that's happened to you at the games come on let's go to be story there is one we were rowing the half marathon in 13 Zack forced and this I tweeted this a couple years ago his AK force at me and we're rowing and we kind of like lock eyes awkwardly and he goes think about pancakes that's what I'm doing it was like that's better than what the hell we're doing right now because it was awful but yeah it's funny I don't know why that was so funny to me at the time when I was like I needed that yeah so it was good pancakes that's what I'm doing are you happy that you didn't do the marathon right yeah you know we we were talking about that actually this last week and I have where the full marathon roll would be terrible but the half marathon road that we did with the two case sprint I think is worse because you had to go so hard because especially for me not doing well on that first event I had I had to sell out on that that 2k and then having to suffer through a half marathon after that was so daunting and miserable cuz you're just so uncomfortable and you can't like you know what you finished a 2k for like a PR 2k if you want to roll off the rover and like ride and paint you had to keep pulling on that rope what was your TK time six uh first thing that comes to your mind right now say it  couch what's the most amazing thing that you've done and then you've like looked up and look around and no one's ever noticed it yeah I've had babies mom we're talking about yeah now dad reflexes like you know everybody talks about that like trikes one day was walking out to the barn and there's only one mud puddle the entire way there and I'm like now there's no way sure enough he walked right to it slips and I catch him like by the shirt before he falls flat on this mud pole and I'm like that was awesome and nobody saw such a letdown you're just like wow I'm the badass and then you're like I know you're like yo right nothing so you know air rifles are now they're like I guess it's like the first offenders come over with a girl in it yep yeah what do you think about that do you like it are you a fan it's an airsoft rifle like it shoots plastic pellets so it's fine I think so yeah I know people are gonna say that it promotes violence but it's an airsoft pistol like it's not gonna be I'm glad they did a biathlon cause innocent pretty much an explorer right people like yeah yeah yeah yeah how can you argue that I mean they do it in the Olympics so yeah and you are gonna go individual row but in the classic the legend and the legend lasers of that that's the game plan right now as long as health health permitting yes that's the game point I've seen I've seen your life and it's like people are always you know like the article came out like the joke article that then I picked up on as it gets the views yeah oh yeah  you know like it everyone's like oh you know finished 10th in the open which is super impressed laughter you know like thank you you you're not like you're not going out there to win the open you're just doing it like you don't you didn't even have to do it to do it yeah but you just did it anyway like everything one and done I redid the handstand one because it was it wasn't that terrible and I knew I needed to go fast from the handstand walk it was more almost like I should go faster let me redo this one so just a lot of people are saying like oh why doesn't he come back and do individual you know and go against Madol and I look at it from the point of like you've done your thing and now you like when you look around and when you're at the barn like it's so fun to see you interacting with your your family right kids and set up and I think a lot of people maybe don't understand some do yeah I think you know like part of it is to like physically I feel like yeah I can hop back out there and still be competitive but there's something there just like after the five years of competing as an individual and doing the individual thing for so long that you just like I step back from it and the the mental like the the kill switch like I don't I don't have to feel like I need to do that anymore you know like that I don't have that where I want to go out and win the CrossFit Games as an individual and so if I'm physically the same as somebody else if they have that extra little switch obviously gonna win because I get an open workouts and I'm like I should push right here your election as bad I wish I had that feeling I'm not yeah and I can't it's just for me I feel like it actually be a disservice to competing to know that you know if I went out there I don't have that same push that somebody else has that should be their that they have that push I don't know just for me it's it's not I guess now you get that push from the people around you from the team yeah like I will I'll do whatever I'd have to or whatever I can for my teammates but for myself I'm like you know it is what it is you know it's I don't have that anymore I don't I'm not going out there to get third or top ten like I would if I'm going across there games as an individual I'm going to win yeah and so I wake up every day as an individual my goal was to win the CrossFit Games now when I wake up every day my goal is to be at that yeah and so it's different you know his priorities are different so but you still have a lot of training in there I still and I in but I love what I do and I and I get to train hard and I still get to compete and and fulfill that side of my life but it's not when I'm done training I don't think about training anymore like I can kind of I still at times think about training that'll be alive but it's not when I was an individual I was obsessed yeah people said I would we were talking to people last night and they were like yeah he used to just come in and bury us and then I'd be like I really have to go yeah and then he was like no you're not leaving it's pretty accurate yeah I mean I was you know in in relationships and other things like that suffered and I'm just not willing to do that anymore like and I have nothing left to prove you know I don't feel like - so you play video games I'm horrible at video games I actually do have a we have a we built to one of my buddies built a chair for a steering wheel and so with the only game I actually play it's NASCAR because you can just drive and I can play that pretty well but like I'm terrible with Call of Duty or anything like that awful one piece of advice for people who are getting into CrossFit you know there's people that have new have fun yeah that's the thing everybody gets so caught up you know Pat Sherwood says there was a saying that you said you know like make it the best hour of your day CrossFit and fitness should not be an added stress even if it's not CrossFit do something like I we get so caught up and fighting about you know it's bodybuilding of the power lifting is across but I don't care do something like and make it enjoyable making a stress relief and not an added stress so many people get so caught up in oh you know I didn't and that it is good to have goals and to push and you know to have something and you know to be worked up about it but man when it's when you're done leave it leave it at the gym and have fun I'm gonna get more out that if you enjoy exactly exactly I supposed to be a stress relief not an added stress and you're bringing out coffee on you Josh is working on good dudes coffee so we'll see I'm I'm gonna have to actually start drinking coffee I guess because I don't do caffeine the only time I do caffeine is when I compete just so I have more sensitivity to it a couple years ago I quit quit doing caffeine so drink any caffeine other than competition days I miss it last one I'm never gonna have every job except for nikah this is why my fitness is not fully understand now yeah yeah kind of play it by ear a few would ask me last year I said I know year or two left and I'd be done but this year I feel great is the best I've felt in a long time health-wise as long as I feel like I'm not holding anybody back and I can still you know hold my own and be a productive member of the team I'll compete as long as as long as I keep enjoying it so I feel good right now Jeff Bridges says he wants to go team there we go no such ideas knee fixed yeah the thing working first ta said ta said once she's done with individual shorts to go team hey come on you guys get up and you know this this vlog is honest right like what is your nutrition like because I'm like this is 269 yeah well so I've you've been hanging out with me a lot when I'm doing intermittent fasting yeah and so I eat from 1 p.m. until 9 p.m. and so I have been working with RP the last couple of years and so they did have me on like a full schedule but then in August after the games you know I'd been reading some stuff on intermittent fasting how it was good for inflammation some other things and I was having so much inflammation of my knee I was like I want to give it a shot see what it does and I felt great since August so I'd do in a minute fasting that I try to work in my my food within that eight hours and so right at one o'clock is usually when you know I eat a lot and then you know throughout depending on training sessions and what we're doing then I'll leave and you do eat cookies and ice cream and things like that hey you know if it fits in there you got it it's very similar to at macros they do a lot of timing stuffing and other things it's about getting the certain numbers yes I have a template of like cert amount of protein carbs yeah that's what I'm supposed to get and they want you to get healthier stuff but hey if you got some forgot some extra carbs at the end of the day why not eat your cookie you know right you're having a joint party at your house and you can only invite one person here and that person for the night not obviously my wife you're gonna invite that's the last question you've got to spend four hours with them there's banging music there's a lot of drainage anyway okay anyone in history I mean you gotta see for me I have to say Jesus obviously but Alec Bernardi and it would be but man that's a tough one one person me that person of my wife hanging out yeah just yeah Dan I've lived and lived with me for too long love Dan oh man Shane is the same as a party Shane's a good dude to have around he's funny if you want to chat Royce is quite good at that my slice is exact conversation and this is a good conversation he can talk to you for hours I like a bunch of people I don't like a bunch of people all in one area cuz I don't like crowds but rice and Lakeland anymore kids not in the immediate future definitely not opposed to having more kids for sure we're we're good on the baby stage right now we're ready to be out of diapers for a little while but yeah I would have a fourth for sure if that's the plan if not then we're great with our three you know I was great with Lakeland and then trice came along and loved to have a try surround and now we've got violet so we got it we got a party but it's awesome it's a fun party it's it's chaos look it's good yeah yeah yeah we're not definitely unopposed to doing them now especially heaven had babies for so long you like it'd be nice to start at about two or three but ya know I'm not opposed to two any age we actually had one falter that was around four and so ya know we're completely open to any any situation that fits what what we feel like God's plan for us is ya drinkin your kids will become the fist on earth I don't know I've never pushed them to I will always push them to do something physically active but I'll never push them to do you know anything if they don't want to do prosper they don't have to do CrossFit but I do want them to play some type of support or be involved in something as some part of team you know I just I feel like there's so much benefit life lessons learned in one in sports through competition but to in working with people and being on a team you know some of those things I can't replace you know growing up like some of my best mentors remind baseball coaches and some of my best friends were my teammates so can't replace that and you look great so like I was jealous no yeah I was like oh okay great good Bogey's dirtbikes yeah and he loads of land yeah would hate water gosh what a Josh so Josh just is
