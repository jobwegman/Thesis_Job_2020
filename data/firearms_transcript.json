how things work we now examine the construction of improvised suppressors our first unit is designed for the 22 caliber pistol  [Music] the body of the suppressor is made from ordinary one-inch steel electrical conduit it is cut using a pipe cutter this achieves a flush smooth end  standard 1 H grommet will provide our baffles these grommets fit nicely inside the 1-inch steel conduit and are therefore self aligning sometimes the grommets will require a little bit of grinding to achieve this ideal fit  the one-inch steel conduit at top is one inch inside diameter the aluminum tubing below is one inch outside diameter this means that the aluminum tubing slips inside the one inch conduit the aluminum tubing will provide spacers for our grommets  the standard one-inch grommets thus fit flush and even with the 1 inch aluminum spacers [Music]  brass tubing is also available in one inch outside diameter  in this first design a piece of brass tubing will be used as a barrel extension this tubing has the same outside diameter as the holes in the grommets cuts are made in the barrel extension to allow the gas to escape into the dampening materials a high quality epoxy is used to attach the grommets to each end of the barrel extension  a piece of steel screening is cut the length of the space between the two grommets  the steel screening is in wrapped around the barrel extension  rubber bands are used to temporarily hold the screening in place  the screen is then secured with metal twist ties  [Music]  using a technique of the class three manufacturing pros white lithium grease is added to the screening material this will help cool the hot expanding gases  [Music]  a small piece of screen is rolled up and inserted into the aluminum spacers as well it expands providing the bullet path and the actual assembly lithium grease would be used on this screen as well let's examine the main components of this assembly first we have the nut epoxied into a end cap followed by the barrel extension relieved to allow the gases to escape next come the aluminum spacers between each is a grommet at the end a rubber wipe the first bullet will cut the hole through the rubber wipe an electrical conduit end cap will complete the assembly these electrical conduit end caps snap fit into the one-inch conduit  [Music] this first design for the 22 caliber pistol will make use of the commercially available muzzle adaptor couplings shown earlier a nut with threads that match the muzzle coupling is epoxy to the inside of the electrical conduit end cap a hole is cut in this end cap just large enough for the muzzle threads of the adapter to pass through [Music]  the standard nut fits nicely in the end cap and the actual assembly it will be epoxy down and the hole would be larger  the endcap is coated with epoxy and then tapped with a hammer to seal the unit a [Music] wooden dowel is used to aid and the Assembly of the suppressor first a barrel extension followed by the aluminum spacers and a grommet  [Music]  note that the grommets are inserted pointy in towards the muzzle of the weapon [Music]  the spaces are stacked with the grommet between each spacer  [Music] with the aid of the wooden dowel the entire assembly can then be inserted into the one-inch conduit body [Music]  [Music] the wooden dowel is then removed and the final rubber wipe inserted and the actual assembly the end cap will be epoxy Don a coating of flat black paint and our unit is ready to test  [Music]  units of this type design register approximately 70 decibels  [Music] note that it's 71 decibels our 22 conduit suppressor is a little bit louder than the book drop in a little quieter than the balloon pop our second unit uses a PVC suppressor body the nut has been epoxy into this smaller piece of PVC tubing in the actual assembly this part would be inserted with PVC cement to secure it to the suppressor body in this design a barrel extension is not used a piece of metal screening is flattened out and the steel wool spread and pressed against its surface [Music]  a wooden dowel is used to roll the steel wool up again the screening material [Music] the screening material will be secured with a piece of copper wire our one inch OD aluminum spacers used in the previous design will be used here to cap each end of the screen and steel wall assembly this will allow this assembly to be inserted into the PVC body more easily and will also align the bullet path  [Music] removing the wooden dowel we can observe the bullet path in the actual assembly the aluminum spacers would be epoxy the entire assembly is then slid into the PVC body the PVC body has an inside diameter of one edge the wooden dowel is used to recheck bullet path alignment a grommet is added which secures alignment  and a small rubber washer in preparation for our final life  our final wine will be cut from this thick piece of rubber a piece of the PVC tubing will be used as a template  and the wipe simply cut out with scissors  the rubber wipe is inserted inside the PVC end cap the first shot who established a bullet path through the PVC wipe the PVC end cap containing the white is then pressed over the PVC body in the actual assembly this part would be secured using PVC cement [Music]  the PVC cement makes a very secure and easy hold however it makes a permanent installation the caps cannot review removed to replace parts the suppressor  this design proved more effective than our conduit yet shown previously this PVC unit registered 63 decibels slightly louder than the pellet gun the unit was also longer than us had more internal volume but the use of screen instead of a cut barrel extension likely accounts the superior performance of the PVC in it the bottom line is that how loud something sounds is quite subjective being interpreted by the brain through the sensor of the human ear a firearm suppressor works much like an automobile muffler which cools and baffles the hot gases of an internal combustion engine before they exit to tailpipe likewise a suppressor cools and reduces the hot expanding higher velocity gases produced by the burning propellant of the cartridge machine tools provide the ideal solution to both the alignment and attachment problem and can use metal rather than flexible rubber wipes due to the precise tolerances machine tools can maintain without the benefit of machine tools and provide suppressors must use rubber wipes these burn out fairly quickly in effect accuracy since they often touch the bullet as it exits the light machine tool units are thus more durable and can be made so precisely that the bullet never touches any internal wipe this makes machine tool units more accurate but as we have demonstrated improvised units can be just as quiet as the best machine tool manufactured units finally those silencers are portrayed in the movies as instruments of spies and assassins no suppressor is so efficient that the shot cannot be heard nearby the reality is that suppressors will wants popular items with sportsmen and target shooters simply because in reducing noise and muzzle blast they make firearms more pleasant to shoot I hope you found our video entertaining and informative thank you", "_-Wdwjlu9mY": "", "VCS4fXFmCyA": "oh my word do we really need another two to three versus five five six story Gavin gear here from ultimate realtor calm I say yes I just got a whole huge load of brass in from capital cartridge and have been researching and preparing for a whole bunch of two two three and five five six related stories stories around the air fifteen loading and shooting all of this and I found a ton of misinformation and I found some big gaps in the information that you need to fully understand this problem domain so in this video we're going to give a brief history of the development of this cartridge and the corresponding ar-15 and m16 rifle platform we're gonna talk about differences in chambers differences in ammunition safe interoperability guidelines reloading let's get to it in the 1950s through an organization called conarc the US Army outlined the requirements for their next generation modern rifle platform these requirements included a 22 caliber projectile supersonic bullet velocity at five hundred yards a net rifle weight of six pounds or less a magazine capacity of 20 rounds select fire for both semi-automatic and fully automatic use penetration of a u.s. steel helmet on one side at 500 yards penetration of a hundred and thirty-five thousandth of an inch steel plate that's about ten gauge at 500 yards accuracy and ballistics equal to m2 ball ammunition that's the thirty out six ammunition used in the m1 garand and wounding ability equal to the m1 carbine this wasn't just about the rifle this was about the rifle and ammunition that would be used in it and that's what led to the joint development of the two to three Remington ammunition and the ar-15 rifle platform that would be adopted by the US Army as the m16 while Remington Arms took a lead on the ammunition side Eugene stoner and Armalite rifle took a lead on the rifle platform side but this was a truly joint industry effort the industry working together to help satisfy the requirements that the army had outlined in the 50s for the next-generation rifle platform so in 1963 Remington introduced their civilian version of the ammunition outcome from this effort two to three Remington a year later the army adopted the army version of the ar-15 rifle platform called it the m16 with full auto and semi auto firing capabilities but they didn't specify two to three Remington ammunition that would be too simple they specified a new specification for ammunition called 5.56 nato and this people is where the trouble started because 5.56 nato and two-to-three remington are almost the same but they are not let's take a look at the differences if you pick up a two to three cartridge and a 5.56 cartridge on the outside they are identical nearly identical for all intents and purposes exterior dimensions are the same the differences will be seen when you look at the case rim first off on the 5.56 cartridge you'll see a date code potentially a symbol those kinds of things you'll also see a stamped ring around the primer itself that's the Crypt primer pocket and it's a way that the US military ensures that the primer won't back out during warfare full-auto fire of that kind of thing on the 2 to 3 cartridge you won't see that crimped primer pocket and you'll see a 2 to 3 R M or 2 to 3 plus a part of the manufacturer's name Star Line puts the little line on there of course that kind of thing but what about the case itself if you look online you'll see that 2 to 3 has a working pressure rating of about 55,000 psi while 5.56 has a working pressure specification of about 63,000 psi so the 5 5 6 brass must be thicker and stronger right wrong it has more to do with how pressure testing is done than it does with the actual working limits of pressure between these two cartridges the sami methodology which is what 2 to 3 Remington abides by uses what's called a conforming line on the case a hole is drilled right where that conforming line is and pressure is measured to report via a piezoelectric transducer this gives a very accurate reading of pressure over time as the bullet starts to move and as it goes down the bore that kind of thing with the 5 5 6 cartridge the military uses a couple different methodologies for testing the first is EP V 80 now this type of testing involves a pressure port a hole drilled forward of the case mouth and that makes it very easy and quick to take measurements and to do that type of testing because you don't have to drill through the case itself you don't have to make sure everything's lined up that kind of thing but peak pressures are higher the readings are higher even with the same equivalent cartridge and the actual noise level in the pressure measurement the fluctuation that's just due to the dynamics of the measurement is also a factor and that has to be filtered out as well along comes the second methodology SC ATP this is more similar to the civilian Sammy method for measuring pressure a holes drilled through the case it's in about the same location and guess what the SC ATP specification for 5.56 ammo is about 55,000 psi so at the end of the day these cases are very similar and and almost being equal they're virtually identical and interoperable the cases themselves I've weighed a whole bunch of these cases and I've found two to three that weigh more of found in 5.56 that weigh more but their differences have more to do with how they're certified and tested than what the actual cases themselves where there is a big difference is the chambers 5.56 chambers and 2 to 3 Remington chambers are different let's take a look at how that looks on paper so after doing a whole bunch of research and consulting with multiple industry partners I came up with this summary of the differences in chamber dimensions between 2 to 3 Remington and 5.56 nato just know that every rumor manufacturer is going to grind their Reimers to this vacations they feel best represent these guidelines and every rifle manufacturer is going to tweak things just a little bit and then there's all of the hybrid chambers let's walk through the numbers that I came up with you can draw what conclusions you will so this diagram represents a cross-sectional cutaway of your rifles barrel and focuses on the chamber dimensions specifically the differences between 2 2 3 & 5 5 6 starting at the back the base diameter 4 5 5 6 is about two thousandths of an inch larger the shoulder diameter is about seven tenths of one thousandth of an inch larger from the base to the shoulder plus four thousands of an inch four five five six from the base to the front of where the case mouth would be about three thousandths of an inch longer on five five six but where the real interesting differences come in are with the free board the free bore is that smooth section of bore ahead of where the cartridge sits but before the rifling or the bullet jumps just a little bit before it's guided into the rifling by the throat the throat is the angled section kind of like a forcing cone on a revolver four five five six the freeboard diameter is about two and a half thousands larger but the key difference really is the free bore length itself for two to three it's 25 thousandths of an inch four five five six it's double that this makes a big difference with the kind of pressure characteristics that different bullet profiles are going to have for ammunition chambered in these two different rifles so what about shooting two to three Remington and shooting 5.56 nato ammunition two different cartridges a bunch of different variant chamberings what's the interoperability story the safest rule to abide by is if you've got 5.56 nato ammunition you need to shoot it in a 5.56 nato chamber if you have two to three remington ammunition you can shoot it in any of the variants chamberings including two to three remington two to three wild the Novus key chambering and 5.56 why is this it actually has to do with bullet profiles the military uses a bunch of different specifications for 5.56 one such case is the 63 grain tracer load and this 63 grain bullet is less dense because of the phosphorous inside that means it requires more volume and one of the ways to get more volume is to move the ogive of the bullet forward on the bullet profile the ogive is the curve of the bullet that first contacts the rifling when they move that ogive forward that means there's more of a likelihood of peak pressures as the pressures building inside the case and as that bullet is starting to move in the free boar towards the throat and this is where 5.56 with twice the free boar has less peak pressure under those circumstances compared with 2 to 3 Remington so there are a lot of interesting cases in the Middle where interoperability may be possible between 556 NATO ammunition and 2 to 3 or other chambers I would really urge you to do your research and be very careful you are responsible for your own safety there may be things you can figure out that are safe to do but do your research first and always look for pressure signs it's not worth risking your life so that pretty much covers interoperability what about reloading that's a whole other interoperability story now reloading 2 to 3 Remington reloading 5.56 nato pretty much follow all of the basic guidelines for equipment and process that you'd find when with any other bottleneck cartridge the one difference being that you really have to be careful with case prep on 5.56 nato to remove that crimped primer pocket you got a swage it you gotta remit you got to do something to get rid of it so you have smooth prem beyond that the key consideration is load data we talked about the cases and how the cases may or may not be different well it turns out that the load data is different the cases might not be different but they might be certified differently the ammunition the pressure ratings all of that so the safest thing to do is to use 5.56 nato load data when you're loading 5.56 nato cases and use 2 to 3 Remington low data when you're loading two to three Remington cases if you look in some of the load manuals like the Hornady load manual they actually have separate data that is very similar maybe slightly different again you'd better to be safe than sorry better to be careful than careless when it comes to your own life and the longevity of your firearm the safety of those around you that kind of thing so I've got a whole bunch of videos on loading two to three Remington and 5.56 nato and other bottleneck cartridges that you can check out but make sure that you're using the right data for the right loan I hope that you found this video useful I absolutely love to shoot in low two to three Remington and 5.56 nato I've got all this brass from capital cartridge then I'm

Finnish-style log stove also known as a Finnish log torch there are several methods to heating up a camping tent without a portable metal stove you can set up a long log gap fire outside the tent just close enough so that the heat would radiate through the tent wall also you can heat up a large rock and bring it inside the tent you can easily find a large rock in the root ball of a falling tree even in a snowy forest but this video will demonstrate how to heat up a camping tent using a stream of warm air from a metal pipe running through a Finnish log torch I have already tried this method using traditional campfire but was not happy with the results this time I'm using a Finnish torch with a curved pipe as a modification to the prior method I should say upfront that I was pleasantly surprised how well the tent heating method worked this time first of all we will need a metal pipe for our experiment I used the curved steel pipe from the headrest of a vintage metal bed the headrest was rusty so it took me some time and effort to disassemble it into parts and clean them both outside and inside okay now we have all we need to conduct the tent heating experiment in the snowy forest a pipe thermometer and wood I stashed a few dry segments of a fallen fir tree last summer so we could save time on cutting it now I left the wood segments wedged and suspended in the original log so they could stay dry now we need to make a Finnish log torch the log torch unlike the Finnish log candle keeps all the fire inside the wood segment it burns slower and more economically to maximize the economy and duration of heating are the two characteristics I want to achieve in this project there are many ways you can make a log torch but I'll use the easiest one it is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit -12 Celsius outside and all the moisture in the wood freezes so it becomes fairly easy to chop wet wood as the frozen moisture swells the log from inside however my log segments are dry because they were kept suspended above the ground so it isn't that easy to chop them without a wedge to make a log torch tent heater you need to chop a segment of wood into three or four large pieces and remove the cool portion of each piece just enough so that you could loosely feed the pipe inside the formed channel because I was chopping wood for two log torches (for two experiments) I got warm real quick my trusted Billinas #9 Finnish axe rose to the challenge I think it is one of the best multi-purpose axes out there I even used it to build my log cabin at Ladoga Lake traditionally you would reinforce a Finnish log torch with viza a rope made from fir branch I will leave a link to my video about how to make such bushcraft rope below this time however I will use my homemade clamper and steel wire as it is a lot faster time is valuable in the northern winter forest because the day is short and I need to assemble two log torches and my tent before dark the reason I need two log torches is because I need to test two metal pipe shapes a single-bent pipe and a u-shaped pipe we will try a u-shaped steel pipe experiment first obviously we would have to insert the U-shaped pipe into the torch's triangular opening before clamping the torch assembly once I added legs to this log torch it became heavier but it is still fairly mobile I can easily pick it up by its legs and carry it to the tent in order to heat up a tent, well, we need a tent)))  this means it is time to set up my tried and tested tent model UP5 it is a spacious camping tent for five people almost a small studio apartment with no pesky neighbors and a great location however it won't be easy to heat up such a large space which makes the experiment even more interesting and trustworthy my double wall russian-made tent has an umbrella-like frame that allows you to set it up quickly now it is time to fire up our log torch as I said earlier I nailed three legs to each log torch for better air flow and stability next I cleared a small spot from snow so that the log torch wouldn't fall on the tent once the snow melts under it I didn't have a shovel so I just stomped and pushed the snow aside with my legs I was glad I had my custom tailored gaiters on they prevented snow from getting into my shoes and getting my feet wet I will leave a link to the gaiter template below in case you're interested as you can see I nailed the legs with their longer portions at the bottom and checked the torch assembly with my weight however I decided to install the torch upside down to use its longer leg as a pipe support this way the metal pipe will be suspended in the air and it will not press on snow under the torch or the torch's inner burning part I made a V-cut on the tip of a former leg and now the heating pipe is well secured you can also use two nails to secure it if you don't have a sword to make a V-cut the easiest way to start our log torch is to plug the central hole at the bottom with a piece of bark then stuff it with dry branches and wood chips it only takes one match to start the fire then I didn't do a great job chopping and reassembling the log segment into a torch with no radial gaps this means the fire will eat up the torch faster through those gaps which is why I put some snow in them to prolong the torch's life once the log torch reaches its cruising temperature you won't see any flames outside the torch's walls inside will slowly burn which in turn will heat the fresh air inside the pipe that is flowing up to the tent note the fresh air gets into the pipe below the level of the log torch preventing any carbon monoxide from mixing into it it is freezing outside and the long aluminum pipe cools off quickly if the first pipe segment is too hot to touch the second segment that is closer to the tent is noticeably cooler to improve the torch's efficiency I decided to move it closer to the tent and this is where I made a mistake I didn't push the legs all the way to the ground and I faced the consequences later my tent has two entrances so I could use one door to run the heating pipe through and use the other one for all other needs note I'm not forcing the airflow in any way yet the airflow is significant I'm using a small feather to demonstrate it admittedly my tent is large and it will take at least an hour to heat the top through such a small diameter pipe without supercharging this is why it's still freezing inside the tent but I make it to wait to see if this tent heating method works so I decided to take a short nap in my cozy sleeping bag I was napping for at least an hour and a half before I got out of the sleeping bag to measure the air temperature the air got really warm inside the tent even though I forgot to close a small chimney hatch which means it would have been even warmer inside once I put my shoes on and looked outside I saw that the log torch fell on its side because I forgot to push its legs all the way to the ground the log torch melted snow and evenly which caused it to topple I'm glad I didn't put the torch too close to the tent as it would have burned a hole in the wall even though the toppled log torch could have still worked longer I couldn't wait to test a single-bend-pipe design of this method so I prepared and fired up my second torch to save time I used the same legs with nails but this time I used my clamper to reinforce the log torch over the legs as well which pulled the log pieces together even tighter resulting in smaller gaps between them thus resulted in longer burning time also thanks to the additional metal wire clamps the torch ended up being extra strong I got a little carried away jumping on it to demonstrate its durability ))) I think I might adopt this simple idea of just clamping parts together with steel wire to make primitive log furniture for my cabin I hammered two nailes at the bottom opening to prevent small branches from falling through it it was easier and faster to start the fire without a U-shaped pipe sticking from the opening another advantage is you can easily move a burning torch from one place to another something you couldn't really do with a burning campfire this is why I decided I like the single-bent pipe method better because the U-shaped pipe cannot be removed from the burning torch if needed it is 10 degrees Fahrenheit -11 Celsius now the efficiency of such a log heater depends greatly on the temperature gradient in other words the greater the temperature difference inside and outside the tent the better the air flow will be I reached 57 degrees +14 Celsius inside and that is considering I didn't call the second door fully so there is a 47 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Celsius temperature gradient to be honest I didn't expect such an impressive result I would dare to suggest you can reach tropical temperature values in a small tent the temperature of the air coming out from the pipe is definitely higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit degree +60 Celsius unfortunately my thermometer scale maxes out at 140 Fahrenheit +60 degrees Celsius here are a few words about the methods safety firstly there is no fire inside the tent secondly there is a constant fresh air flow coming into the tent you are totally protected against carbon monoxide poisoning because the pipe gets the fresh cold air below the level of the burning log torch also a log stove can be used for cooking food even while it's heating up your tent I personally like the single-bent pipe modification of the method better you can put the pipe in or take it out at any time which makes it easier to start the fire to cook certain dishes or to carry a burning log torch to another location however the U-shaped pipe scheme gets the fresh air from the side and if a small burning ember falls through the torch you won't smell any smoke inside the tent from my experience even if that happens you can barely smell any smoke inside the tent so my conclusion is this it was an interesting experience and successful experiment it is labor consuming but safe and effective besides carrying three short metal pipes is a lot easier than carrying a portable metal stove while traveling in the snowy wilderness I think this method can be further improved if you have any thoughts how you can make it even more efficient please write it below I would love to hear your suggestions lastly if you extinguish a locked torch a little before it is fully burned you can get yourself an unusual piece of primitive furniture I haven't quite figured out how I could use it let me know if you have any idea what can be done with it the log torch idea has a lot of other practical applications for example I recently published a video about an original bushcraft dish that I called a vertical shish kebab it is a skewered spiral potato with a hot dog inside I have grilled the dish on the campfire many times and always found it delicious however the vertical cooking method has its advantages firstly you don't have to rotate the skewer yet the dish cooks quicker and more evenly secondly skewered dishes cooked in the vertical stove taste better than kebabs cooked on traditional grills regular kebabs drip fat on the coals causing it to taste and smells slightly burned while kebab dishes cooked in vertical stoves do not drip fat on fire but rather self -basting which enhances their own taste when I cooked my skewered spiraled potato dish the seasoning fat ran down the potato as it cooked basting it with meaty taste I don't think I can go back to traditional horizontal grilling a more detailed instruction on how to make a vertical stove and prepare food in it can be seen on my video: Swedish Torch/ Stove Vertical Cooking / My Bushcraft Recipes

you I'm taking real people out on the road to get their questions answered and you're coming along for the ride this is verify Road Trip this is not a story about whether to ban the ar-15 but in the wake of mass shootings like Las Vegas and parkland it always comes up you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself I just don't think we should be selling ar-15s in this country weapons to be legal so we want to verify are there legitimate reasons to own an ar-15 [Music] thank you allison is a verified viewer and she is politically conservative I feel like people should have the right to own guns but it's a mom with four little kids the ar-15 really scares her we have all of these other avenues for hunting and for sport so why does it have to be the ar-15 ellison's never fired a gun before and me just once a long time ago so jera Hodgins is teaching us both how to do it she's an nra certified gun instructor  all right I'm right here pulling the trigger really felt like it was a big decision and it was kind of it was intense for me you're gonna do the same thing I'm gonna give you three fire when ready finger back to trigger discipline  there aren't any hard numbers but most people estimate that millions of Americans own some kind of ar-15 type rifle what do people use the ar-15 for what is its purpose self-defense hunting competition is there a reason that we have to have an ar-15 you know I would tell you that the sport of hunting demands it but more than that the the reason that you should be able to have one is simply because you can at the range - he's a life long and are a member who hunts 100 days a year and had his first gun when he was four what's lost if you don't have it access to they are 15 what do you lose I lose the most effective tool for protecting the lives of myself and my family so I have four kids I have um sorry but it also is really difficult for my kids to have lockdown drills in school if we could take away this option and it would make my kids safer why can we not do that of course in the back of your mind you wonder is someone gonna walk onto campus one day and do something bad but my solution to that is is not that I am so scared by the thought of that that I want to punish law-abiding people in a way that is not really going to have an impact on a crazy person's ability to do crazy things did you ever think you to turn ar-15 no I never thought that did you ever think you'd go on a feral hog hunt no well welcome to verify now we're traveling to Oklahoma to see Rancher Kristen Cogan she's telling us feral hogs eat crops transmitted diseases to livestock and tear up hay meadows like this one nationwide that's a 1.5 billion dollar problem why the ar-15 wide is this the only option for hog hunting I wouldn't say it's the only option I would say it's the most effective option right how much of a handicap would it be to not have access to that weapon it would be it would be a big handicap you will not find a better gun for hog hunting than they are 15  it's night time when the Hogs come out and we're going on a hunt if you see a hog coming y'all can jump behind me chef Bailey is our guy he prefers the ar-15 over a bolt-action rifle you don't want to be worried about jacking a boat every time when you're trying to kill large amount of hogs and so ultimately all you have to do is pull the trigger over and over and over  it's like that  go each of us got off 12 shots in about five seconds it was intense I felt like I pulled it was but in reality it was a dozen times they got at least one at least one that's probably a thousand dollars worth of damage a thousand dollars at that hog would have done damage yeah that was a good shooting I'm highly impressed for two people that had never two people that had never fired we open that thing out baby they did they shot away  so are there legitimate reasons to own an ar-15 so what's your answer the question are there yes there are legitimate reasons for this hog hunting purpose I could totally see how it's an effective and efficient way to manage the population but Allison seems just as scared about the gun as she was at the start it happened so fast like there's no time to react you know how could anyone defend themselves against that you know you're just done look Allison doesn't like this gun but we did verify there are legitimate uses for the ar-15 don't take my word for it take hers", "f41mCg9O0wU": "hi everyone today we'll talk about firearms of the Wild West yeah a cowboy in this trusty colt 45 although Colt 45 that's kind of boring how about a cowboy with his led spewing pepper box add to that at killing harmonica a revolver shotgun combo in a pull stirring revolver them old gun Smiths were truly inventive weren't they so let us tell you about the most curious and remarkable guns of the Wild West Allen and Thurber pepper box this bizarre weapon looks something like a pocket machine gun and like a real pepper box as well the strange appearance aside these guns were quite popular in the frontier lands first they were simple and reliable second they packed enough firepower at close range and that's exactly what people needed for self-defense third they were affordable four times cheaper than a colt so unless you work pro gunslinger you were likely to opt for one of these besides Allen and Thurber offered a wide choice of models ranging from 22 to 36 in caliber and from 2 to 6 inches in barrel length they could have four barrels or five or six whatever you say as long as you pay and they come in grave - yes sir many of these budget handguns look quite fine with the frame ornaments and imitation silver inlays very pretty the main drawback of pepper boxes was that they were muzzle loaders loading was cumbersome and it took a long time but once you get one loaded pepper box has had a double action trigger which was an advanced feature at the time the army Colt for example had a single action trigger so the shooter had to cock it manually Remington Model 95 remember that movie scene when the supposedly unarmed Django all of a sudden produces a cute little double-barrel it was a model 95 double derringer a truly remarkable pistol it was tiny less than 5 inches long and weighing 11 ounces but this little thing was loaded with 41 caliber cartridges and it spewed the letteth 685 feet per second given that the 1873 army colt has a muzzle velocity of just 650 feet per second this wasn't half bad for an 11 ounce piece this handgun could fire twice before reloading once from each barrel reloading involved opening the barrel lock swiveling the barrels upwards placing the cartridges inside and putting the barrels back down all these steps for a total of two shots so you could say this derringer was a two shot single tri weapon either you hit the target on your first attempt or you were in trouble curiously the pistol had no trigger guard when not in use the trigger was stowed away within the frame fins and could be brought to readiness by cocking the gun the double derringer was intended for concealed carry and was so popular among gamblers women traders travelers and generally anyone who wished to protect themselves against a sudden attack this piece could fit easily inside a woman's purse or be hidden in the clothes overall remington sold more than 150,000 of these handy affordable sidearms to barrel 20-round pinfire revolver in an effort to create a high-capacity handgun 19th century gunsmith tried different approaches some of which were quite bizarre the French inventor lafa all came up with a model that involved two barrels and a huge cylinder housing 20 pin fire cartridges this type of cartridge was also his invention the revolver was first patented in France but eventually reached the u.s. it quickly gained popularity especially in the American South and for a good reason at that the main advantage was obvious 20 shots against the adversaries 5 or 6 with the double action firing mechanism the shooter also had an advantage in speed firing alternatively from two barrels without needing to cock the hammer the seven millimeter caliber was rather small but that's understandable the massive cylinder could not be made larger without reducing overall efficiency even the way it was the revolver felt heavy and difficult to handle the inventor tried to alleviate this by getting rid of the trigger guard instead the owner could fold the trigger and tuck it up into the frame a questionable solution true the revolver became somewhat lighter but the foldable trigger makes firing less convenient LeMat revolver Jean Alexandre LeMat was a physician by trade ironically he invented a revolver shotgun combo with considerable stopping power could be the guy got fed up with all those pesky patients in any case the PC created turned out to be powerful efficient and innovative its main feature was a smoothbore 20 gauge ii barrel that fired buckshot and since revolvers were mostly used at close range the result was devastating the other barrel was a conventional rifle board 6.5 inches long and firing 42 caliber cartridges which for the 19th century was pretty modest but the cylinder could house as many as 9 rounds not bad at all the shooter could switch between the barrels simply by shifting a lever on the hammer however this revolver had quite a few flaws and serious ones at that first the rambures lever was rather flimsy second the smoothbore ramrod would often fall off and get lost third the indexing mechanism was prone to wear for these reasons the lamotte never gained wide popularity it was deadly and versatile all right but unreliable and expensive Colt revolver rifle meet a revolver that was also a rifle although after the revolver shotgun combo it doesn't sound all that weird this revolving percussion rifle was an attempt to make a multi shot long gun and it wasn't particularly successful but there was no good alternative so no one complained essentially this rifle was the same em 1860 revolver but with the stock and a very long barrel although there was one difference the rifle was self cocking in some models the inventors went for seven or eight chamber cylinder since the weapons overall dimensions allowed for these kind of experiments but mostly it was the same old six 36 caliber or 44 caliber rounds the revolving rifle offered relatively low accuracy but made up for it in the rate of fire the ammo was easy to come by the gun required no special rifle cartridges and could fire the standard revolver rounds but despite these many advantages the weapon didn't fly it was truly difficult to handle a long gun isn't a revolver it must be held with two hands one hand would grip this rifle right in front of the cylinder and firing gas is remarkably hot getting fingers burned after each shot isn't anyone's idea of fun Noel caplock revolver there is power name's Pierre Noel named his invention a roto vulvar and the weapon turned out to reflect the name complicated and cumbersome basically it was a cap lock revolver with a cylinder axis running horizontally at the right angle to the barrel why was it this way who knows this handgun was hard to carry because of the bulging cylinder would catch on things the loading process was the whole project onto itself first you'd need to remove the cylinder so what you ask take it out load it up put it back in not so fast the weapon design simply wouldn't let you do it quickly placing the loaded cylinder back into the frame required quite some time and who would need that power-wise noeul's handgun wasn't too impressive either the 0.28 9 caliber coming out a 3.5 inch long barrel is quite modest although the foldable trigger was guarded from accidental pushes by means of a safety tab on the right side of the frame the cylinder chambers were located radially so one round was always directed squarely at the shooters face who would appreciate that gun slingers of the Old West didn't know L was able to sell a few hundred roto Volvo's after that the production collapsed even multi-shot 10 cap cylinders couldn't save it Cochrane turret revolver John Cochrane was another gunsmith who approached things from an unusual angle he invented a revolver with a cylinder rotating around a vertical pivot it looked like a close relative of noeul's roto vulvar and had the same problems the cylinder had to be removed for reloading the gun couldn't fit inside a flat holster and two rounds look straight at the shooter at all times but in terms of inconvenience Cochrane did reach a new height the shooter had to manually rotate the cylinder after each shot so you cocked the gun you fire and then you turn the drum and cock the gun again now that was innovative naturally no one would buy a marvel like that except for collectors cochrane sold 150 pieces of this in total he didn't abandon the concept though and came up first with a drum rifle and later a field gun he even managed to sell the patent to Turkish gunsmith making good money granted the artillery design never made it to production but that was the Turks problem Jonathan Browning's harmonica here's another example of a multi shot long barrel weapon and once again an ill-fated one Browning's horizontal harmonica magazine held 554 caliber cartridges firing wasn't automatic of course the shooter needed to slide the magazine by hand making sure to place the next cartridge precisely under the hammer and in alignment with the barrel don't forget that in the process of shooting the magazine got really hot this caused another problem the charges in the neighboring chambers could catch fire and in the best scenario the shooter would lose the entire load in the worst case he would end up with a few extra holes in his body to prevent chain firing gun owners smeared the Chamber's with a wax and towel mix by the way the maker of this weapon Jonathan Browning was the father of the legendary gunsmith John Moses Browning looks like gun making was a thing in that family Jonathan was a faithful Mormon he had three wives and 22 children he inscribed the words holiness to the land our preservation on all his weapons yes the first word was holiness on a 54 caliber five shooter bank tellers mounted revolver bet you haven't seen this one before this 20 shot contraption that doesn't look like anything else is still in fact a revolver it just has no handle basically is no frame either what it does have is grooves for mounting to a wall or to a counter and a trigger ending with an eyelet for a piece of rope or wire here is how this astonishing device was used it was mounted at a strategic spot on the wall under a desk etc the important thing was that the barrel would point at the person entering the room often two of these weapons were used to cover a wider area if the esteemed patron turned out to be a transgressing robber the bank teller would open fire one way was to install a pedal under the desk this was can be discrete and effective the teller would hold up his hands smile politely at the intruders and step on the pedal shooting the poor souls on the spot another way involves ropes bank tellers desks and counters were often protected with bulletproof plates at the first sign of danger the teller would duck under the desk and pull the ends of the ropes of course the opposite ends were tied to the triggers they see banks often became robbery targets in the Old West [Music]  this system wasn't especially effective still even poor protection is better than no protection at all volcanic pistol the volcanic pistol is one of the first creations of the famous Smith & Wesson duo the talented inventors were still inexperienced at the time and the product they made proved problematic this handgun was supposed to benefit from multiple truly brilliant concepts but turned out to be ineffective unpredictable and unsafe volcanics main issue had to do with the case less round it used it was a conical bullet with a hollow in the rear end the hollow was filled with powder and then Stoppard with a primer naturally the amount of powder that could fit the hollow was small less than 0.01 7 ounce for a 38 round that simply wasn't enough for a 0.23 ounce bullet this kind of ammo afforded no distance accuracy or stopping power and couldn't scare a mouse on the other hand they often exploded even right at the gun store the faintest jolt could bang them against one another igniting the primers and the entire shelf would go kaboom as for the design of the pistol it was actually good the rounds were housed in a tubular underbarrel magazine turning the lever caused the rod to cock the hammer and readied the trigger at the same time the mechanism lifted a new round the return of the lever caused the hammer to load the round into the barrel chamber the barrel chamber was shut securely with a crank and rod assembly sounds familiar it should sometime later the same mechanism was used in Winchester and Henry rifles the world-famous gun maker Oliver Winchester was part of the volcanic company and picked up quite a few things there the tubular under barrel magazine was also used later in the 1871 Remington handgun which enjoyed some popularity well however all these models use more advanced rimfire rounds instead of the hazardous rocket-like bullet what an unfortunate beginning for Smith & Wesson so many excellent ideas and the pistol turned out to be a failure we hope you enjoyed the video and

so far the war has been triumphant for the Empire of Japan they had achieved a string of victories across the Pacific and had captured many research rich territories however Japan still found herself in a difficult position despite all of their successes their biggest opponent the United States had yet to show any signs of surrendering this was worrisome Japan needed to end the war quickly before the US with his mighty industrial strength ultimately defeated him so what Japan needed was to win a decisive battle one that would demoralize the Americans and finally bring them to the negotiating table it was considered that America's centre gravity was as Pacific Fleet primarily its carriers destroyed this and you destroyed their will to continue the war therefore the only chance Japan had a winning this war was if the American carrier fleet was destroyed but the question was how to provoke the carriers from leaving it's safe base at Pearl Harbor the answer attacking objective the Americans wouldn't relinquish without a fight and after much debate it was decided that Midway would be that objective if the Japanese attacked an invading Midway the Americans was certainly responding force and this would finally give the Imperial Japanese Navy a chance to annihilate the American carrier fleet once and for all and thus operation mi was created with the objective of capturing Midway and destroying the Pacific Fleet the Japanese premise their plan on achieving surprise and therefore would have to make the 3,000 mile voyage on radio silence also they were to disperse their forces in order to avoid detection and mask their intentions in conjunction there was another operation to the north to take over the Aleutian Islands which was codenamed Operation Al and so on the early hours of June 4th all the forces were in position to attack a small tiny Atoll in the Central Pacific the stage was set for one of the most epic engagements in naval history this is the Battle of Midway the battle will be told from the Japanese perspective the fog of war will be included during this video that means you the audience member will only know the positions of the Americans the moment the Japanese commander knew of it this is to put the audience member in the commander's seat to see how they would have reacted themselves given the unique circumstances and complex scenarios that plagued the Japanese on the morning of June 4th so to start off let's see who the commander was and what is forces worth spearheading the mi formations were for top of the line fleet carriers of the first mobile striking force also known as the Kido butai this was the most destructive offensive weapon the Japanese Navy had and would be the main protagonists of the upcoming fight its commander is Vice Admiral Nagumo xishi he was 55 and had assumed command of the first air fleet in April of 1941 he didn't get this post because he had a naval aviation experience in fact he has specialized in torpedoes he got the job simply based on seniority it was said his command style lacked decisiveness and that he was too reliant on his staff nevertheless in June of 1942 he was the most experienced carrier commander in the world Nagumo had four carriers with him this day his flagship was the ACOG II the ACOG he was the oldest and longest of all the flat tops she had a large aircraft capacity and since she had been converted from a batterer Cruiser Hall possessed the high speed Chicago was a battleship conversion so this made her the least maneuverable and the slowest of the four but she did embark the most aircraft while typical squadron strength was 18 she herself carried 27 carrier attack planes these two carriers were just solid war horses of the Kido butai they packed a mean punch and were not to be messed around with  next came to two dashing Cavaliers of Cary Division two they were the smaller but more nimble salute class they were designed from the keel up had a good air group size and a very high speed due to their light holes and construction however the downside was that they were lightly armored the so do came first being commissioned in 1937 she was well liked in the Navy her near sister ship the hero was almost identical but had a larger bridge and was slightly better armored real Adam Yamaguchi was a commander of Carrier Division two and he made the hero his flagship he was another high-ranking member of the fleet and was known to be an aggressive hot temper commander compared to Nagumo from the four carriers Nagumo had a combined strength of 248 aircraft 260 total aircraft if one includes the Scout planes from his escorting cruisers what was equally important in the aircraft themselves was the quality of Nagumo's air crews it wasn't a stretch to say that at this point in the war the best naval pilots in the world who were on board these four ships Nagumo's mission was not going to be a walk in the park he essentially had a dual mission one take out Midway he needed to neutralize the base and its aircraft before the invasion convoy arrived two days later and task number two was to keep a lookout for enemy carriers that might appear in the defense of the islands now this was unlikely as the Americans were not expected to react so quickly to the invasion but as a safe measure he was to keep half of his strike force armed with anti shipping weapons in the event the Americans did show up early it has to be mentioned here that there were some ominous signs for the Japanese as mentioned the Japanese were counting on surprise for this bold operation to succeed however on the eve of battle there were signs that this may not be going their way intelligence had revealed suspicious enemy activities around Midway meaning the Americans were more alert than they should have been and second it must be emphasized that the Japanese up to this point have failed to confirm the location of the carriers the Japanese believed they would have to face a two possibly three carriers two therefore so it was imperative that they get a confirmation of their whereabouts it was believed that they would still be in Pearl Harbor during the first days of the operation and there were two attempts to verify this the first was a reconnaissance mission to record her Pearl Harbor however this mission had been canceled but there was still a fallback plan a picket line of submarines ahead of Nagumo's force and so far none of them had reported anything at all this indicated to Nagumo that the American carriers were most likely still import so as far as Nagumo was concerned everything was going as planned  dawn June 4th compared to the scatter cloud cover to the northeast the key to boot I found itself under low but like cumulus clouds the carriers continue to steam into the wind which is coming from the southeast to prepare for the air raid at O 4:30 a strike of 108 aircraft was launched against Midway all of these planes were launched in just 10 minutes a testament to the skill and training of the Japanese pilots leading the strike was lieutenant tomonaga Joey she he was a veteran of the air war over China but this will be his first combat sortie against the Americans Nagumo had to keep the other half of his planes in reserve in case American carriers appeared the pilots in this group were the a-team the best Aikido boat I had to offer akagi's torpedo squadron was said to be the best in the Navy while carry Division two had the reputation of having the best dive bombers any report of an American carrier and these pallets will make easy work of them at the same time of the launch of the Midway Strike Group reconnaissance planes were sent out from the escorting cruisers the search consisted of seven lines six of which stretched out to 300 miles clearly with only seven planes to cover more than a hundred and seventy-six thousand square miles the search effort can be considered half-hearted perhaps even negligent but in the goo Mo's defense it must be reminded that this was a precautionary air search simply put Nagumo and his staff were convinced that no enemy carriers would appear this early into the battle although I would say criticism is justified I mean given the fact that inter reported suspicious activities around Midway and given the bad weather in the area Nagumo should have doubled his search efforts as a safety measure it's what a prudent commander would have done anyway the launch of the search planes went well accepted the launching of float plane number four from the cruiser Tony was delayed for thirty minutes as the military proverb goes no plan survives contact with the enemy and today would be no exception the operation officially began to unravel at oh five thirty two an american catalina pvy was spotted surveying the kedo bousai dam Nagumo had been spotted meaning surprise had been lost this meant that the Americans would be able to get their land-based aircraft airborne before his strike arrived  as predicted the Americans have been able to launch all of its planes before the strike arrived the Bombers went to attack the Japanese carriers only the fighters stayed behind to defend the islands these were 18 obsolete buffaloes and six Wildcats they intercepted the Japanese io6 20 30 miles from the base they never stood a chance with the more agile zeros in the ensuing battle 13 buffaloes and two Wildcats were lost the carrier strike aircraft pushed through and began their bomb runs carried Division two level bombers struck first at OU 634 the dive bombers would come next at o 640 on Easter Island the power plant command posts gasoline lines and miss Hawke were destroyed but damage to the runways was minor on Sand Island the oil tanks were set ablaze and the water lines were hit a seaplane hangar in various base facilities were also destroyed for their effort American fighters and anti-aircraft fire destroyed 11 Japanese planes another 14 will be rendered unserviceable when they landed back on their carriers that's a 23% loss the damage to Midway support facilities had been heavy but the base wasn't out of the fight the Air Group commander lieutenant tomonaga looked back at the condition of Midway and with great dissatisfaction had to report back to Nagumo that a second strike was needed to neutralize the base  what follows next is a series of complicated vents and situations happening to poke the Kido butai and onboard Nagumo's headquarters so I'll tackle them separately starting with the initial air strikes against Aikido butai  @o 710 60 bf Avengers and 4 army b-26s were spotted approaching two Japanese carriers this would be the first of four separate attacks from Midway base aircraft that would harassed him throughout the early morning over 30 fighters were sent to destroyed the ten American warplanes the Avengers selected the hero zero swarmed over them and one by one the torpedo bombers were shot down only two were able to launch at the hero or from extreme range and they missed the four b-26s which had been modified to carry torpedoes went for the acog ii only two were able to launch but they both missed the real danger was posed by the last b-26 the damaged bomber made no attempt to pull out of its attack instead it headed directly for a caucus bridge Nagumo and his staff saw this and were shocked the Americans were not supposed to show this kind of bravery the bomber pressed on and at last minute narrowly missed the bridge in crash into the sea his suicide attack had failed but surely he had given the Goom on his staff one hell of a scare despite the bravery and determination the attack had failed to achieve a single hit 5 Avengers and two Marauders have been shot down the Japanese lost two zeroes  half an hour later at O 753 a new force was spotted approaching the mobile force 16 Marine Corps Dauntless dive bombers  nine zeros set out to destroy them the dive bombers pressed on and went for the hero instead of going for a steep dive ensuring accuracy these planes conducted a glide bombing attack they were clearly inexperienced pilots if this was their way of attacking they managed to bracket the heater with some near misses but ultimately no hits were scored they lost half of their squadron leaving only eight survivors to return to Midway the Japanese lost only one zero and shortly after that attack fifteen army b-17s attacked from 20,000 feet at this altitude the b-17s were immune to the anti-aircraft fire below them however this also greatly diminished their accuracy they went after the Soto he drew an ACOG II but the carrier's below them had more than enough time to conduct evasive maneuvers and avoid the bombs there were no losses on either sides and no hits were scored only near misses on the Soto and hero caused any alarm a remarkable set of photographs were taken at this moment here's the hero dodging a couple of very near misses note the three fighters of combat air patrol under flight deck here we got the ACOG II in the goomers flagship while under attack easily noticeable is the red Rising Sun painted on the deck and the third picture shows the Soto she's conducting a tight turn to starboard to avoid being hit carrier doctrine and flight deck operations need to be commented on here during attacks the main priority was obviously the defense of the carriers this came in three forms anti-aircraft fire combat air patrol and evasive maneuvers Japanese anti-aircraft fire capabilities were very weak so could not be counted on so dis left fighter cover and evasive maneuvers as the main forms of Defense for Nagumo's force there was a downside though one due to the evasive maneuvers that require wild and violent turns it was obviously dangerous to spot or launch a squadron of aircraft while being bombed so let's say you wanted to launch an airstrike but then you found yourself under attack it would actually be better to wait until the attack was over to then fire off for strike and second point as these pictures show Japanese flight decks had to be kept clear anyways during air attacks for the replenishment of their own fighters and this was rather frequent since a zero had about seven seconds of Canon ammunition fighters were given priority because they did after all provide the most effective measure of Defense hence the only activity you would see during attacks was the recovery replenishment and relaunching of these small packets of fighters three at a time sometimes six at a time in other words and the point I'm trying to drive in here was that as a general rule you couldn't launch a strike while under attack so let's just say hypothetically then at this moment Agumon wanted to send a strike it was prudent to just wait until the attack was over maybe 15 20 minutes and then launch his aircraft so maybe these attacks aren't being accurate or deadly but they are hindering flight operations keep this in mind as you will see the fateful consequences of it  Midway's final attack came at 2711 old marine corps Vindicator dive bombers arrived from the southeast these were obsolete bombers and they wisely decided not to go for the formatively defended carriers instead they selected the battleship Haruna as their target there were 11 fighters on combat air patrol to oppose them the Americans persisted and made their dives on the Haruna but once again none of them scored a hit to vindicate errs were lost during the attack and in the midst of all of this a submarine had been spotted in a oh wait when t5f fired a torpedo at the battleship Karishma the battleship dodge did by turning to port and the destroyer dashi was detached and sent in pursuit to chase down the summer as you can see this had all been a narrow escape for the Japanese these series of close calls surely had everyone on the edge of their seats although the Japanese were impressed by the determination of the attacks they were not impressed by the skills of these pilots just by 52 planes being dedicated to the attack not a single hit was achieved on the Japanese the biggest success these attacks had was that a had kept the Japanese off-balance from a 700 - Oh a 30 which as we will see was a critical time for Nagumo  during the early morning attacks on the Quito booty a more serious situation with developing in the high command with Nagumo and his staff surely after all 700 hours Nagumo received tominaga as report that a second strike was needed the news was unpleasant but had actually been expected how could a force of 72 bombers half of which were armed with medium sized bombs be expected to neutralize a fortified base he could allow tomonaga flight to return refuel and rearm and then send them back but of course this would take hours to complete allowing the Americans to lick their wounds and reform their defense this would contribute further casualties or alternatively he could strike the Americans while they were still down he could use his reserve aircraft who at the moment stood idly by doing nothing but these were exclusively off the table because Yamamoto had ordered them to be reserved in case of an enemy carrier task force appearing but surely Yamamoto wasn't expecting a Goomba to fight an entire battle with only half his strength I mean come on this was tantamount to making Nagumo fight this entire battle with one arm tied behind his back and this right here had been the fault in the whole midway plan there simply weren't enough planes there weren't enough planes to do the dual mission to both attack Midway and to keep a reserve in case enemy carriers appeared so Nagumo looked at the maps and by now his air searches were reaching their maximum range and so far nothing had been found or reported so why not use these planes for the second strike and let's not forget that at this moment a maverick plane from Midway had just tried to suicide crash into his bridge Midway was clearly still a threat and as long as his airbase was operational it posed a danger to his carriers this is what probably prompted Nagumo's consequent decision Midway had to be neutralized thus at 11:15 Nagumo went against Yamamoto's orders and ordered the rearmament of his reserve aircraft the rearming process began in the hangars below torpedoes were removed and lamb bombs installed the dive bombers weren't affected by this because they were armed once they have been spotted on the flight decks so in reality this chaotic fast-paced rearming process was happening only in the hangars of the first carrier division all in all this process was going to take about an hour and a half to complete then 30 minutes into the rearmament process at ol 7:45 Nagumo received a report that Tony plane the one that had been delayed ran across an American force site what appears to be ten enemy surface units Nagumo was stunned he quickly cancelled and reversed the rearmament order and took stock of the situation it will basically boil down to two options for him send an immediate strike right now or send the strike after Tom maracas planes were recovered this is what is most commonly known as Nagumo's dilemma so I will ask the viewer to put themselves in the Gumo shoes for a while to better understand his conundrum and I'll let you know it's not as simple as it looks many factors have to be considered keep in mind that you would have had only 15 minutes to decide on the correct course of action so let's first dive into the aggressive option which is attacking immediately okay first off deciding didn't even make sense based on the location Tony number 4 plane was never supposed to come across it either he wasn't where he was supposed to be or the task force location was incorrect this brings up the composition factor it was unknown what did 10 ships mean it could be a carrier task force or they could simply be auxilary ships Nagumo didn't know and this was unsettling what if he sends a strike and the sighting proved to be just as stories or support ships this had actually happened to an emoticon a month earlier in the Battle of Coral Sea Nagumo did not want a repeat of that mistake but there were two additional alarming clues about the sighting why was there force 240 miles northeast of Midway there would be no reason for a force to be in this location unless it contained a carrier and if it was a carrier it would be in a prime position to unleash an attack on the Japanese's flank and more importantly why was a steering into the wind as it was known it was procedure for aircraft carriers to steam into the wind when launching the aircraft Nagumo and his staff apparently saw the validity of these two clues but in the end came to the conclusion that it was most likely just a surface force second the rearmament process wasn't as devastating as many believe the Val dive bombers weren't affected by this only the Cates 34 had been armed with torpedoes but now only 19 were ready 15 have been switched to land bombs so instead of having a full strike complement of 78 planes he now only had 64 planes properly armed although that's only a difference of 15 64 planes were more than enough to sink any task force encountered and here's a third factor time Nagumo was restricted on time because tominaga spores would soon be arriving at about Oh a 15 and it would be low on fuel meaning they had to be landed quickly unless they were forced to ditch se this was the worst timing ever for Nagumo Japanese flight decks were restricted in that they could only do one operation at a time they could either launch recover or spot aircraft thus Nagumo had to decide either launch his counter strike now or recover the Midway strike the fuel situation was troubling if he didn't want to lose any more plane stretching he needed to finish the recovery by Oh 8:45 the latest why oh wait 45 well let's take a look and work backwards to calculate the time constraints it's also in 45 now tominaga splaine's had enough field to fly overhead until about oh nine fifteen it would take 20 to 30 minutes to land him that makes oh wait 45 the threshold you better finish your launching process by this time or I'll start losing aircraft by ditching this leaves Nagumo with an hour of leeway and it took about 45 minutes to spot and launch an air strike so if he wants to take this opportunity to launch an attack with what he's got he can but he would have to start the process by Oh 800 the latest thus this is the 15 minute window Nagumo got to make a decision geez talk about being under pressure huh was an attack feasible yes it was it will be a tight squeeze but if he began now by Oh a hundred by Oh a forty-five his counter strike would have taken off in tominaga explains who will be flying on fumes at this point with Dan land however scratch that hypothetical because I also in fifty-three dakedo boot I came under attack by those dive bombers theoretically he could still launch a strike while under attack although this was rarely done in combat and it was extremely risky but one thing was for sure that 45-minute launching process would have definitely stretched out closer to the length of an hour as a result the possibility of tominaga Zaire group having to commit a mass ditch would become likely disposing of perhaps dozens of aircraft at the start of a battle was unthinkable  so Nagumo had to decide does he attack this unknown target based in this sketchy unconfirmed location with some of his planes carrying the wrong ordnance and risk losing additional planes by unnecessary ditching or he could simply wait until tominaga strike had landed and then after recovery launch a full balanced strike and whatever this target is with the proper ordnance this was clearly the ultra safe choice that offered no unnecessary risk but what made Nagumo think he still had time well if we take the reported position face-value the location meant that even if this force contained a carrier it wouldn't have been within strike range of an escorted strike the Americans will have to close a distance and then launch a strike which meant it wouldn't reach Nagumo's carriers until about 10:15 some two hours from now thus Nagumo would have the time to launch his own counter strike before he himself was reached so I asked a viewer to press pause and consider the options honestly with all this information at hand what would you have done  with the conservative mindset in aguma had it's not too difficult to imagine which course of action he took he went for the safest option he would recover his plane's first and then launch a powerful well balanced strike at the enemy the gumo opted for this choice because it promised mass and coordination over anything else for as much as Nagumo has been criticized his decision was doctrinal if any other Japanese commander had been in his place they would have also made the same decision  so let's continue the saga down below the crews and the hangars worked feverishly to change the Kate's with Lam bombs back again two torpedoes in the midst of all the chaos the bombs were not stored away safely instead they were laid haphazardly around the hangar above in the bridge Nagumo waited impatiently for further information and it wasn't until oh wait 20 that identification of the surface units finally came through the enemy is accompanied by what appears to be a carrier this was dreadful news well you may ask why not attack now that you have definite confirmation of a carrier well it would still take 45 minutes to get the aircraft out of the hangar spotted and launched meanwhile tominaga zaire group would all run out of fuel and crash into the sea and just there you lost 97 planes also the strike would have to go uh Ness courted since all the fighters have been brought up to assist in the air defense of the mobile force during the recent attacks so the option of launching an undistorted strike which was bound to receive heavy losses and lose 97 planes Dramastic wasn't seriously going to be considered by Nagumo basically it was too late for Nagumo to attack now he had made his bed and now he had to lay in it he would have to wait thankfully for him the last morning attacks die down by o8 37 the kiddo boot I finally got a break from all the morning attacks and could now begin recovering the aircraft from Oh 8 37 - Oh 910 tominaga strike force was safely landed while one can sympathize with the predicament Nagumo is in there was a decision that was questionable the Kido boot I changed course to the northeast after recovering the air strike why this was not necessary Japanese planes out range the Americans there was no reason to close the gap it would just make it quicker for your opponent to reach you a wiser decision would have been to head Northwest still allowing you to strike back but keeping you at the extreme striking range of the Americans with the last of his aircraft recovered Nagumo was now free to begin spotting his planes on the decks it was looking good for Nagumo all he needed now was a 45-minute uninterrupted window and a powerful counter-strike will be dealt to the Americans however events with soon foil his high hopes  off to the north enemy aircraft were spotted damn instead of preparing to launch a strike in the gumo would now be forced into evasive maneuvers and focus on protecting his carriers from the forthcoming assault these 15 Devastator torpedo bombers were coming in and with no escorts they would be easy prey for the 30 fighters that were protecting the mobile force the four carriers turn to port to present their stern to the incoming attackers what followed next was a stern pursuit which put the devastators at a disadvantage because of their slow speed they could barely break a hundred knots while carrying their ordnance the fighters swarmed over them with impunity and they were cut to pieces two-thirds were intercepted before they were even close to making their run-ins only three got close enough to threaten de Soto but ultimately only one just one of the 15 who was able to launch its torpedo  however not only the history Domus but the pilot was shot down himself  the attack had lasted about 15 minutes although the Japanese probably didn't know it at the moment they had just destroyed an entire squadron and there were no hits to stand for it there would only be one survivor of the 30 aircrew who participated in this heroic attack  but as soon as that attack was over at Oh 9:40 another one began this time from the south it was at this time that Nagumo had to have realized that his mobile force was in serious trouble it was imperative than a gumo get his planes off the deck before being hit himself all he needed was a 45-minute window to launch an airstrike but during attacks he couldn't launch a strike because his flight decks were solely occupied with the replenishment of the combat air patrol fighters to add to the mess he was in a dangerous state because at the moment he was at his most vulnerable his planes were fully fueled armed and parked densely within the hangars of his carriers and more disturbingly it was clear that these were carrier base bombers obviously the reported location of the carriers had been wrong this whole time they had actually been 55 miles closer when they were spotted out 728 thus his mobile force had been within American strike range this entire time this is a clear example of the fog of war just like at Coral Sea the Japanese commander had made a decision based on the information at hand although unbeknownst to him the information having incorrect sometimes you can just plain out have bad luck one thing was for sure Japanese Scout planes needed to practice their ship identification and spotting skills oh well maybe Nagumo can dodge this attack as well the 14 torpedo bombers came in honest courted the two divisions had selected the kaga as their target and they were trying to do an anvil attack on the slow carrier but it would be difficult to do with their slow lumbering planes initially they came in on a post but then zeros swarmed over them and the rightmost division took the brunt of the attack two torpedoes were launched with the kaga dodged him  with additional zeros added to the fray only three torpedoes from the other division were released but just as before the kaga skillfully avoided them as well once again an attack have been pressed on gallantly by the Americans but it had been ineffective nine of the 14 bombers were shot down and of these five survivors one had to ditch on the return trip only one zero was lost and when that attack finished guess what another one began you have got to be kidding for the last 50 minutes these piecemeal attacks although as ineffective as they were were delaying the launch of the desperately needed Japanese Counter Strike in more frightening judging this to be the third torpedo squadron there definitely had to be more than one carrier actually there wasn't just one there were three boy it wasn't a Gumo in trouble also the Japanese must have asked themselves at this point where were the dive bombers if the devastators had made it this far an imminent dive bombing attack was sure to come but something was different with his forthcoming attack these twelve torpedo bombers came in with an escort of six Wildcats the zero set out to intercept him but little did they know they were in for a surprise for the first time in the war the famous statue was used named so by its creator Jimmy thatch who was leading the division the planes would start in a beam defense position once a zero was on the table Wildcat the two sections would turn towards each other this allowed one section to get a head-on attack on the chase and zero it would either kill or brush off two zeros on your partner's tail the process could easily be repeated this defensive maneuvers stunned the zero pilots up to this point in the war the Japanese pilots would always come out victorious in dogfights against their opponents but now they were the ones getting beaten for zeroes were shot down and only one wildcat was lost during this interception  Thach in his fighter squadron alone attracted the attention of over 2009 first the escort had done an excellent job 11 of the 12 diverse layers were actually able to push through for their run-ins and this post a considerable threat to the carriers this caused the remaining zeros who were looking up for any nearby dive bombers to descend from their high altitude patrols to shoot down these intruders therefore as we can see the northeast sector became a magnet sucking in all the fighters on combat air patrol disturbingly does have the effect of leaving the carriers with no overhead protection what we are seeing here is a dangerous example of target fixation all eyes were glued on this developing threat that the situational awareness that is keeping a lookout for any other threats was forgotten this was leaving the kita booty in a vulnerable state  the American bombers carried on but with fresh zeroes diving from above the Devastator stood little chance to prevail the same story played out and over half were shot down eventually only five would end up launching at the hero but the Japanese carrier successfully avoided them the end result would be that 10 of the 12 torpedo bombers were lost and one of their four escorts for no hits this last torpedo attack probably accounted for about seven fighters the time was 10:20 the torpedo attack was halfway through and as expected not one had struck home it was a testament to the prowess of the Japanese pilots the Kido booty had been in combat for the last three hours and had avoided all the bombs and torpedoes thrown at it with its evasive maneuvers and its skilled fighters Nagumo had been quite lucky actually his mobile force with no radar has shot down 53 aircraft at his point and had lost only 11 fighters itself and there wasn't even a scratch on his ships but it was precisely at this moment when all the fighters were down below fighting off this latest assault in the northeast sector that a new threat emerged high above 50 dive bombers were approaching overhead undetected and unopposed and coming from two different directions Nagumo's luck had finally run out  [Music] [Applause]  dakedo boot I had never been faced with the feet before in the previous six months they had ruled the Seas they had sunk five capital ships on light carrier two cruisers and half a dozen destroyers but now they're unbroken string of victories would come to an end these dive bombers weren't rookies like the Midway based bombers these were the eighteen of the Pacific Fleet and with no opposition the result would be deadly from the South came two squadrons in the all teamed up on one carrier the enormous cargo 30 dive bombers began their steep dives from 19,000 feet takagi was practically taken by surprise and she received four hits one of which landed on the bridge killing the captain and his staff the planes being fully fueled and armed inside the hangar ignited causing a chain of secondary explosions she quickly became an inferno the Soto was attacked by 13 dive bombers three bombs were placed evenly along the center her flight deck all her hangars were hit and just like the kaga the bombs set off a chain of explosions inside the ship fires immediately engulf the carrier and looked after the acog 'i might get off scot-free however when the cargo is being pummeled three dive bombers peeled off at the last moment and went for her with pure scale a bomb was dropped in its upper hangar it didn't seem serious at first a carrier this big could have certainly survived his single hit but just like her sister ships the planes and bombs inside her hangars began to detonate thereafter fire spread uncontrollably and the acog II the flagship of the Kino butai was doomed  [Music] in less than five minutes history had changed the powerful Kido boot I have been rent only one have been able to escape destruction the hero the outcome of the battle now rested upon the shoulders of the hero and her early pilots [Music]  you [Music]  you", "qFwntHIWjaw": "[Music]  hey everybody how you doing as you can see right here behind me today we're doing a cinder block test we're gonna be testing today pistol ammo the nine-millimeter the 40 and then the 45 we're gonna see how many walls of these cinder blocks does it take to stop these full metal jackets and the 9-millimeter we're shooting 115 grain in the 40 we're shooting 180 grain and in the 45 we're shooting 230 grain all these are Winchester mo thanks to Winchester for making these bullets let's go have some fun I'm gonna shoot the 9-millimeter first then the 40 and the 45 let me stop here and take a guess you see these cinder blocks here how thick they are I think that the nine-millimeter is only going to go through one wall and the 40 and the 45 are going to go through the second wall and I've got stuff underneath here so hopefully we can even still catch these full metal jackets but we'll see what happens I'm thinking nine one wall forty forty-five two walls let me know in the comments down below what do you think is gonna happen who knows maybe he'll surprise us and each one will go through four or five but let's load up and see what happens I shoot the 9-millimeter first all right here goes the first shot with the Winchester 9-millimeter 115 grain  [Applause]  we hit the block that's a good thing let's see how many walls cinder block that nine millimeter went through alright there's an obvious hole in the front wall doesn't look like there's anything behind it so we look at the second wall there nope it definitely hit right about there you can see now the question is is the bullet in here come around from this side and I think that's the bullet right there now is it hot not too hot but look at that pretty wild how that jacket who it is hot it's burning my hand but I want to get the shot so I'm leaving it you can see the bullet there and then the jacket around it how it deformed pretty cool this got block all stuck to it pretty cool we caught that 9-millimeter answer for the 9-millimeter went through one wall I know the 40 is gonna go through more than the 9-millimeter I think let's see if the 40 in the 180 grain bullet punches through two walls now we've got the 180 grain Winchester 40 caliber  I know we hit the block with the 40 so that's a good thing let's see how many walls a block that it went through there is the hole in the first block anything back behind it oh it's looking like it might have not gone through the second wall looking at the second wall what do we got looks like exact same thing looks like it hit the second wall there but did not go through is the bullet down in here anywhere hmm got a little piece of jacket right there but you don't have the bullet nope no bullet there you have the answer on the 40/40 went through one wall and we didn't find the bullet I don't know if it's because the speed or the energy of the 40 it just disintegrated the bullet into a lot more pieces in the nine-millimeter but next 45 is the 45 going to beat the 9 millimeter or the 42 more than one wall so far the results are kind of pitiful we need something with some more power let's try the 45 see what happens it's either gonna go through one or two I bet you but let's load up 45 see what happens and now the biggest of them all the 230 grain Winchester 45 caliber  45 did it go through more than one wall did it go through more than the nine millimeter or the 42 let's see what happened first block yes we hit the block and there is a hole in it 100% is there a hole on the other side of it it does not look like it so oh I just saw the bullet we caught the 45 pretty sweet but first of all like we saw went through there coming over and looking at the second wall same thing as the others did kind of hit it there in the center and if you look we did catch the 45 there and I betcha that sucker is gonna be hot whoo yeah it is hot but pretty cool there whoo that's burning hot pretty cool there it mushroomed out almost like a hollow point so that 230 grain 45 mushroomed out when it hit the first wall almost like a hollow-point you see the inside and then the jacket they got pushed back around the edges but pretty cool they're pretty cool that it didn't fall apart there's that 9 millimeter next to that 45 able to catch both of those we now know the answer is on these cinder blocks every single one 9 millimeter 40 45 they all got stopped by that very first cinder block wall pretty cool to see they all pretty much had the exact same result but as always

chance and I thought you know as long as I'm up may as well get the day going going to a little bit of groceries and get my baking soda and so I checked the website for superstore and it says they're open at 7:00 well it's about 10:00 to 7:00 by the time I got to superstore it was just after 7:00 and I'm seeing the store looks like it's closed and I'm thinking well what's wrong now and I pulled around to the front and here's a bunch of employees standing outside and they said a transformer just blew we've had a power failure so off to Safeway I go and that's where I got my baking soda let's get going here oh and I did get some other stuff too now I have no idea how this is gonna go I've never done this before so I want to do a little sample first just to see how the CA glue will will react by the way this spoon don't know if you remember about a few years ago I did a video called something like the homemade gouge or something like that the idea was gonna use a ordinary tablespoon to make a gouge well interestingly that video has had more hits than any other video I've ever posted yeah let's see what happens here  now I turn on the room air cleaner here to circulate they're just a little bit but in one drop  yeah I was afraid it might blow him up all over the place but obviously it's not  I can smell it  there may be somebody wondering what's this all about anyway well a couple of days ago I made a mistake and I cut in the wrong place so I had to fill up the gap and I used wood and it was suggested to me at that time that why don't you use baking soda and CA glue and so that's what this is all about and this repair is just about exactly the same size as what I had done a couple of days ago only of course with wood now I got to keep the baking powder and the crack this is the one we want to repair right well this is just plain old scotch tape I don't know what you call it where you live but I call it scotch tape even though it might not be from the Scotch company yeah I'll just flip that over and I'll do the other side now  yeah I think that's fairly well sealed I know that the liquid CA glue is going to follow the grain of the wood and so code a little bit but hopefully I'm not going to put in too much and I end up with it running down the side here anyway that's the next step well I guess the next step is to pack it full of baking powder  no I don't know if tamping it down is a good idea or not I would think it's a good idea  well let's try that now I don't know if we're gonna be able to see it or not but I think the idea would be to put it on quickly and then when you see it has reached the very bottom well that should be enough  I forgot to put on my Rome air cleaner  [Music]  well as you can see I've laid the dome on its side here about five minutes or so is past I think we can probably take the tape off here okay what have we got soft or hard oh that's not good okay I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit more on right there where I made that dent and then I'll drop the CA in from this side then I'll turn it over and I'll do the same thing on the other side  I know I can always sound this down later but thanks we'll try and get it as good as we can okay here we go  now I have a feeling that this CA glue sets so quickly that it doesn't get a chance to get all the way down into the center of the repair  my other wanna be gluing this to my table-saw either another mistake should have put down the waxed paper oh one more drop what do you think  doesn't seem to be soaking it any more it's it's not curing either I don't see the PM's coming off well leave that for a few minutes to see it we got we'll see what happens when we cut through it and actually that'll because that's the whole idea it's supposed to you know like what we did the other day with a wooden repair and yes I did get a little on the table saw  yeah we'll say that's very hard well this doesn't have to be a perfect sanding job let's just cut through it and just cut through or come on this side over here so the spacing is even the way the wheel was when we're trying to fix the wheel remember here here here and here so the spacing can be the same anyway doesn't really matter I guess  well I can see where this would work okay but not the way I did it what I should have done was to build it up about a Oh eighth of an inch of the time it's sure is strong though I'll say that for it you can see that the inside there it's Hollow  yeah well next time  now as for this box of baking soda I'm gonna keep some of it in a little sealed container down here in the workshop and the rest can go on the fridge isn't that what most people do with theirs [Music]", "Unnvj58sP3I": "playing big-time sports is not always full of fame and victory athletes are people too and they like everyone else are prone to make mistakes if you make a mistake only a couple people will laugh for a few minutes at your failures and immediately forget the failures of these athletes will be remembered for the rest of their careers hi there and today we will look at the 20 most embarrassing moments in sports at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro during the competition of racewalking something very strange happened a bad case of diarrhea caught this athlete by surprise right during the competition and there was nothing the poor man to do about it in this video the suit of British bobsledder gillian cooked burst open before the start of the descent and became a big hit on youtube  [Music]  Lord of Aston Villa Nicholas Helen OU's would have scored another goal if he had not been hindered in such a cheeky way with shorts at the knees it is quite difficult to score a goal  [Applause]  and this Saudi goalkeeper decided to score into his own goal  [Applause] next we have basketball Sam Decker has an excellent breakaway opportunity but as it gets into the open court he trips over his own feet and ends up knocking the ball out of bounds with his face this is a prime example of how not to play basketball and here we have Chicago Bulls Ford Carlos Boozer while celebrating a made basket Boozer accidentally hits the referee with a huge punch right in the nono zone with all his might [Music] some athletes start to enjoy their victory ahead of time this ice skater has overtaken his rivals and has already started to wave his hands to the fans but he tripped fell and the last meter delve on his stomach he had time to overtake but instead of first place he finished fourth  [Music]  a very unusual outcome into the duel between Daniel Cooper and travis Walford a regular MMA fight had an unusual ending after daniel used a choked technique his opponent relaxed too much bright in the cage I think that from now on during future fights Travis will definitely take the toilet paper  and here we see how during the fight both fighters simultaneously sent each other to the ground with a knockout  [Music]  and this is an incredible double knockout after which the fighters could not get up and more than both of them needed medical assistance [Music]  while playing a baseball game you can get a bunch of bruises and abrasions this player decided to view the damage he received from a fall and begin to take off his pants right on the field  [Applause] they say that a good goalkeeper makes up about half of the team but sometimes they make funny and ridiculous mistakes [Music]  and this goalkeeper mr. goal due to the fact that during the match he decided to drink some water [Music] seeing the approaching team the goalkeeper just froze in one position  here's another athlete who is happy about winning ahead of time [Music]  [Applause] and in this video the driver enters the pit stop too quickly and knocks down several members of his team [Music] in this athlete saw the finish line and just ran to it it did not matter that it was necessary to jump over something [Music]  we now turn to tennis because getting a ball below the belt and this sport is easier than ever [Music] and that is what happens if you do not choose the right bowling ball [Music] leading in a race can overtake the mind and reduce concentration that is exactly what happened to Darya domra Sheva in one of her biathlon races in being first she forgot that this round of shooting is carried out lying down and not standing as a result our five shots did not count  Maria Sharapova despite her professionalism could not hit the ball in the exact place [Music] this lucky player was in front of an empty net there was no one near him who would prevent him from scoring a goal but the athlete sent the puck to the other side and then tried to turn around and fell the opponent sees the moment and scored a goal themselves  [Applause] [Music] and in this footage the ref decided to stop the fight but the fighters were too carried away by the fight and ignored him and continued to fight it's hard to imagine how it would all end because the judge just fell into a rage and already the other judges came running to help the fighters due to a strong push the uniform of Finnish hockey player Tommy Maki got stuck in the gap between the glass panels the athlete could not free himself so the referee and other players came to his aid  in this video the girls too late as she tries to stretch for the finish line [Music]  trying to determine the winner

"qn4SJJ0kNzE": "[Applause]  what's up guys this is the honest a lot here and today we are going to be talking about the top five guns from the John wick franchise not just movie one not just movie two or even three we're gonna talk about the best guns out of the entire series would you help set the mood front you guessed it doesn't begin if you haven't seen my channel before I review lots of firearms I review several per week and I've owned dozens and dozens and dozens over my lifetime I've also had the pleasure of owning quite a few of the guns that have actually been in the movies and I know how they handle in the real world as opposed to just on-screen we're gonna be basing the categories of these guns based on how good they are in real life how reliable they are how accurate they are and how cool they look on screen and how they'd handle in the real world situations that John wick finds himself in now I know that John wick finds himself in some unrealistic situations to say the least one guy verse 50 generally doesn't work out that way in the real world however if I was presented with that situation which one of these firearms what I like that's kind of how we're gonna judge it here in this video I want to thank my patron supporters YouTube has recently 100% demonetised my channel so I really appreciate your support now more than ever if you become a supporter the link is in the description below you'll have access to patron elite content and you'll have access to the monthly giveaway this month's giveaway is going to be the Kay Bart TDI night I also want to mention I've got some links in the description below Amazon links all that links and a link to a local homeless shelter which I try to support as much as possible go down there to description and check those out now one thing that makes John wick so cool it's really a movie made for gun guys a lot of times in especially the 80's 90's stuff like that you're gonna have movies that were action movie sure but they were so unrealistic that it's kind of hard to get into them where John wick takes a little bit more realism especially with the gun handling and choices of firearms they actually brought in Taran Butler who's a very well-known firearms trainer and multiple time three gun champion one of the best shooters in the world and they not only took his advice on training Keano so he looks the part and he did many many hours of actual firearms training which makes the footage seem so realistic still off-limits to me what do you need  guns lots of guns now let's start this list out with number five the Benelli m4 shotgun not only is the Benelli m4 shotgun maybe one of the coolest shotguns you can see on the silver screen it's also a pretty excellent firearm in real life the Benelli m4 is a semi-automatic 12-gauge shotgun five rounds from the factory however John wicks from TTI holds seven rounds it has an 18 inch barrel comes in at around 8 pounds it has ghost ring sights it runs an auto regulating gas system with a self-cleaning piston making it one up if not the most reliable semi-automatic shotgun on the market that's one of the reasons why the Marines have used it for the past 15 years the one in John wick happens to be the Terran tactical version which is upgraded with a lightened bolt carrier a trigger job an extractor and Barrel modification a new shell lifter making reloads a little bit faster tuned and polished shell latch and forearm and stock stippling making it easy to handle in case your hands are wet custom bolt carrier release in charging and textured grips should your hands get wet and one of the things they do in movies traditionally is you've got a shotgun that only holds five rounds yet somehow they're shooting 90 zombies with it without reloading one of the detriments 2 shotguns is that they have a very light magazine capacity and you have to reload them all the time and I really liked how they showed the proper technique and the proper amount of shells you can shoot through a gun in John wick too in at number four we are gonna have the Terran tactical T r1 which is an 11-point five-inch BCM ar-15 with a Trijicon acupoint 1 to 6 mounted on top of it for a little bit of added versatility it's not just a standard BCM 11.5 it also has a muzzle brake and i unbonded bolt carrier for a little bit more reliability and durability a volt or stock TTI base pads adding extra capacity one two six allows you to engage really well from close range or from really far away and it also happens to have a very lightweight keymod rail system on it which was cutting edge a few years ago when John wick 2 came out because not only is it lightweight but it allows you to add accessories that you might want if you're in a lot of gun fights like a weapon light for example VCM makes super quality ar-15s it's going to be extremely reliable thousands of rounds downrange without any type of malfunction BCM has had rifles that have gone sixty thousand rounds with no issues and even twenty thousand rounds was very little cleaning a very lightweight very fast very accurate rifle that's also extremely reliable it happens to be compact enough to fight in close quarters it also is going to be powerful enough significantly more powerful than a handgun cartridge and it can take care of those bad guys very quickly I think out of all the guns on this list it is the most practical for an actual gunfight which is why special ops type of guys Delta Navy SEALs all opt for a 10.5 or 11.5 for their standard duty weapon because it's very versatile and it does a really good job at what it's intended to do now one of the drawbacks of this particular rifle especially if you're in the mindset of John wick is the fact that it's not as concealable as some of the other guns that are going to be a little bit higher on the list nobody's gonna have a little bit more firepower it's gonna be a little more accurate however if you don't have it on you it doesn't really matter and since John wick is an assassin and he's not an actual soldier he's gonna need some guns on him all the time because he's constantly being ambushed and he also has to be able to conceal that firepower on him all the time so in at number three the TTI STI 2011 combat master this gun is a 1911 style double stack nine-millimeter it has a 5 point 4 inch match-grade barrel combat master slide cuts a fiber optic front sight one of the best sights possible for a quick sight engagement and as an extended slide release extended mag release and it has a 1.7 pound trigger pull making it extremely fast and extremely accurate it also has a grip job and it has full twenty-two round magazines right from the factory now the twenty eleven is the most popular gun in competitive shooting for a reason not only can 2011's be extremely reliable they're also very fast very accurate the 2011 has the best trigger the 1911 2011 has the best trigger of any gun on the market and since trigger control is your biggest detriment when you're trying to make fast and accurate shots have been an easy trigger like a 2011 it's almost like a cheat code I  really like the choice that they had there and that is from the movie John wick three  [Music] the Terran tactical 2011 was a great choice for John wick because it is probably the fastest and most accurate gun you can carry on you underneath a suit jacket and if you're gonna be able to conceal speed and accuracy that is a really good choice the downside of the 2011 and the reason why it's only at number three is because it doesn't have a track record of reliability like number one and number two and it's also not quite as lightweight being is it's around 46 ounces it would be a heck of a gun to carry on you all day now at number two we are gonna have another turn tactical gun what a weird coincidence that is it is going to be the Terran tactical Glock 34 from John wick 234 is John wicks main sidearm throughout the movie and he gets it from the tasting scene in Italy Austria now the reason why it comes in at number two is because the 34 has a lot of features that people really like especially tactical guys and competitive shooting guys number one it's a Glock so it's one of the most reliable pistols on the market and as easy access to magazines and magazines are very cheap so you can carry many of them also it happens to be very fast and accurate and very easy to customize to yourself Glock aftermarket accessories are very vast and whatever sights trigger you want you can put on the Glock 34 and the tearin tactical is no exception it comes with all the best possible accessories right from the factory the Terran tactical comes with an ion bonded bronze barrel competitive trigger job coming in at around 3 pounds which is about half the standard weight of the original Glock it has a full wrap stippling job competition magwell fiber optic sights we come to grips clad Blackwell for easier reloads custom courting now the advantages to the Glock 34 that it has over the 2011 in my opinion is that number one it's extremely light coming in with a 5.5 inch barrel same as the 2011 so very similar accuracy it comes in at about half the weight at about 25 ounces making it very easy to carry all day and if you were John wick I would certainly want a gun on me all day if I was being attacked by assassins left and right the other thing that has it has the reliability and track record of clock Glock is one of the most reliable guns on the market and it's a reason why a lot of people that are in law enforcement or military use that gun to protect their life because it's just a very trusted name and a very trusted firearm now for some quick honourable mentions the CA 415 which is an American clone of the hk416 from the original John wick movie the KSG 12 from the original John wick movie the MPX from Sig from John wick 3 now finally number one and I really don't think it could be anything else it is the HK P 30 L from the first John wick movie his Ghana throughout the entire first movie and it's really the gun that made the franchise famous it's not stock but it's not as customized as some of the guns in the later movie it does have a trigger job and it does have a custom compensator made specifically for the movie that you can't buy however you can buy a very close version of that compensator from HK parts and I happen to own the p30 and I happen to own that compensator as well so I do have lots of experience now the HK P 30 l is his original sidearm that he digs up from his basement after Theon kills his dog John  [Music]  it is a full-size lightweight polymer frame double-action pistol with a 4.5 inch barrel and it comes with 315 round magazines a very accurate lem double action style trigger comes with great a luminescent sights and is extremely reliable and made to be bomb-proof by a company known to make bomb-proof guns HK has specialized for the last 30 or 40 years in making guns specifically for military use and on top of that specifically for Special Operations usually designed by people in the Special Operations community like the Glock 34 it comes in at a very light weight 27 ounces making it very easy to control and carry it also has ambidextrous controls and the custom compensator will make it very fast shooting at distance and up close to add on to the customization the HK P 30 actually has grip panels and grip inserts to make it probably the most customizable gun to fit your hand the best part about the HK p 30 in my opinion though is that not only is it on par with the other handguns on the list it won't actually break the bank the Aeron tactical 2011 comes in at around four to five thousand dollars the Glock 34 comes in at around two thousand to three thousand dollars depending on what version you get but the HK P 30 L you can get yourself for around $600 and the actual compensator that you can add to the bottom of the gun is only about $200 making that entire package for the John wick gun right around 800 bucks and for a practicality standpoint that is one of the reasons why had to put it at number one because if you're looking to buy a super cool gun from the John Wood franchise to enjoy shooting at your own range it's a lot easier to get a hold of the HK P 30 then it's going to be the Terran tactical 2011 or the Terran tactical Glock 34 it made the franchise possible it's just as just as accurate as lightweight or lighter weight and it comes in at a much lower price making it my number one choice for the best John wick gonna let me know in the comment section below what you think the best John wick gun is and we can compare our list down below in the comment section if you like this video please like and subscribe please help our local homeless shelters and remember to recycle I'll check you later you think you can take John wick you got a nasty surprise coming [Applause]  [Applause] [Music]", "nYzheuJE47E": "I'm Alex Thomas of the Silverado shooting academy we specialize in training for mastery of the handgun the handgun is the most difficult of all firearms to shoot effectively the real challenge of handgun shooting is poorly understood and conventional training does not effectively deal with that challenge this video presentation will give you a clear understanding of why handgun shooting is difficult and show you the secret to mastering the handgun very few people reach their full potential with handguns most people struggle to some extent and don't know why they struggle a common scenario is that a novice will buy a handgun usually for defense and then take some generic training course they'll shoot a couple of hundred rounds reach some level of mediocre and then they'll put the gun away they'll be the first to tell you that they know how to shoot but that handguns just aren't very accurate the problem is not the gun handguns even short-barrel ones are far more accurate than the shooter  if you own a handgun and plan to rely on it then master it don't rely on spray-and-pray I've heard people say a handgun is just what I use on my way to getting my rifle home invaders won't give you time to open up the gun safe even in a complete meltdown of civilization you may not have the option of being conspicuously armed your safety may depend on your skill with a handgun mastering the handgun is about controlling shot placement to the limit of your physical ability shot placement is determined by one thing and only one thing the direction of the muzzle at the instant the bullet clears it your ability to control the shot depends on how well you can stabilize the gun while pulling the trigger there's a simple way to test your potential for doing this you'll need a handgun with a laser and a paper target put up on a wall you're not going to use the sights on the gun but holding the gun up at eye level as though you are siting hold the laser beam on the center of the target observe the laser beam as you pull the trigger the smallest circle you can keep the beam inside of while you trigger is your maximum potential for accuracy if you can keep the beam inside of a 2-inch circle at 10 feet you should be able to consistently hit a 4 inch target at 20 feet you can also increase the tempo of your triggering to see how rapid fire affects your ability to control the muzzle compare the results of this test to what you actually do with live fire eliminating the difference between the two is mastery of the handgun  handgun shooting is not a complex skill it's not like learning to play the piano or violin which takes a lot of time in practice let's look at the mechanical sequence of shooting a handgun suppose we wanted to build a machine that could shoot a handgun a robotic shooter what would we need that machine to do first the gun must be held steady in visual alignment with the target second the trigger must be pulled back to the breakpoint without disrupting the alignment third the operating energy of the gun will disrupt the sight alignment so the gun must be realigned after the shot fourth the trigger must be released back to the reset point for the next shot so we have four basic steps freeze the sight picture squeeze the trigger without disruption realign the sights on target and reset the trigger freeze squeeze realign reset so why is this so difficult to do and live fire the answer to that is pretty simple this is an improvised pyrotechnic device it's 20 inches in front of the camera which is about how far a handgun muzzle is from your face when firing this is what happens when you pull the trigger on a firearm  when you pull the trigger on a firearm you're setting off an explosion right in front of your face the concussion and hard recoil of firearms causes a panic reaction it's our natural response to powerful shockwaves or sounds this happens no matter how tough we are we all have a natural aversion to holding onto things that explode the lower animal part of our brain doesn't like concussion and tries to move us away from the gun at the same time our higher thinking brain is trying to carry out a new skill this high brain low brain conflict is why handguns are difficult to master and why many people lose interest in shooting after their first exposure the very first time a new shooter fires a handgun they'll probably make a good first shot the gun will fire and the novice will experience a startle response better known as a flinch a flinch will never mess up the shot because it's a reflex that happens after a loud sound by the time the sound wave reaches you the bullet is already two feet out of the barrel nothing you do at that point will affect the shot this is a novice student try firing a single action revolver chambered in colt 45 without her knowing when we will insert a live round into one of the chambers she is only trained with air guns up to this point she puts a near-perfect Center hit on target with a large caliber handgun  you got me this shows us two very important things first is that the skills from air gun shooting apply directly to firearms the energy difference changes recoil control but not shot placement second is that these skills are easily applied with good results when there is no anticipation of concussion and recoil after the first shot we will associate the trigger brake pressure applied by our trigger finger with the concussion of the gun this kind of mental connection is called classical conditioning when we fire the gun again our anxiety level will increase as we increase pressure on the trigger we will reflexively brace for the shot our reactive animal brain will have us take defensive action against the expected explosion right at the trigger breakpoint we'll start to shake lose concentration push the gun away or down or turn our head away all of this can happen very quickly and quite often the shooter is unaware of it these reactions interfere with the skill of handgun shooting we call this reactive interference this is the real problem in dilemma of handgun shooting the exact instant which is the most critical for shot accuracy in control is the same instant we lose control of the gun due to reactive interference right at the trigger breakpoint reactive interference has nothing to do with good technique it's the effect of the animal getting into the shooting process if you can't control the animal your skill won't matter you won't be able to apply that skill one of the things we do is put a laser on a gun and set it parallel below the barrel so the shooter can't see it when using the sights but observers can we see students hold the guns steadily on target right up through the trigger pull but right at the breakpoint the laser beam will flick off target in a split instant almost too fast to see the student has no clue why this is happening they know what to do when are doing their best to apply proper technique they're frustrated by this mysterious force that pushes the gun off target as they shoot the student has the skills but they don't have control over the animal at this point you may be starting to realize that mastering the handgun consists of two separate problems first is about the physical skill it's what we do with the gun that affects the shot it's the freeze squeeze realign reset sequence of shooting this is about 10% of mastering the handgun this is the easy part the second is controlling how the operation of the gun affects us reactive interference this is the critical 90 percent of handgun mastery the mental discipline conventional handgun training focuses on shooting as a mechanical technique and not a mental discipline it applies technique to the problem of reactive interference leading to solutions that don't work very well the most popular example of this is dry fire practice which is triggering the gun without ammunition the theory behind this is that it develops muscle memory of correct trigger pull that will carry over when using live ammunition this idea is based on an illusion that bad trigger technique is the major cause of handgun and accuracy since the gun is pulled off target during the trigger pull it's assumed that it's caused by trigger pull because that's the part of technique occurring at the time in reality bad trigger pull will only produce minor variations in shot placement it will drop your score and precision target shooting but it's not the reason people will miss a 14 inch circle at 25 feet I've got a double action training gun here equipped with a laser that I'm gonna drive fire at a 14-inch steel plate at 25 feet I'm gonna pull the trigger in a crude exaggerated manner to see if I can produce misses  as you've just seen ruff triggering will only produce about an eight to nine inch variance at 25 feet it will not take a shot completely off the target now triggering issues and bad trigger control will cause a scattering of the bullet impact points around this very large plate but it's not going to take the shot off the plate itself when you look down at the support beam you'll see a cluster of bullet impact points below the plate going to an extreme of three feet below the target this is not the result of triggering this is a complete loss of composure during the shooting process reactive interference this is the result of allowing the animal to fire the gun dry fire practice will not solve the problem of reactive interference pulling the trigger when nothing happens is one thing but when the gun discharges you're going to react to it there are other similar techniques like trying to create surprise with a slow trigger pull balancing a shell casing on the gun and using a combination of live and dummy rounds while shooting no technique based on physical mechanics is going to solve the problem of reactive interference that's because the problem is not out here it's up here the popularity of dry fire practice does illustrate one very important point you can't perfect handgun skills with firearms and live fire if you could there would be no reason for dry fire practice conventional training insists on starting the novice with firearms because that's the way it's always been done new shooters want to do this because they don't know any better people will go out and buy a large caliber handgun having no experience and then expect to train with their gun if you don't know how to ride a bicycle should you be trying to learn on a harley-davidson that's not the place to start and the same is true for handguns if you begin training with firearms your reaction to the concussion and recoil will dominate the entire training experience starting with firearms presents the novice with two problems at the same time the challenge of learning a new skill while dealing with the problem of reactive interference these two problems conflict with each other which is why very few people reach their full potential with handguns effective training has to be done in two phases first is learning the physical skills without reactive interference the second is learning the mental discipline to overcome reactive interference with firearms a novice needs to know before picking up a firearm that he or she has the mechanical skill otherwise the student can't separate a skill problem from reactive interference this leads to confusion and frustration so how do we learn technique without using firearms this is a handgun it is not a firearm it's a compressed gas training gun that duplicates a firearm in weight size and function unlike dry firing it shoots a projectile and has blowback and muzzle lift products like this didn't exist until recently they allow us to quickly train a novice shooter in basic skill and safety prior to picking up a firearm  Zen refers to an intense concentrated focus of attention on a single task to the exclusion of any distraction no matter how strong that distraction is we're going to apply this to handgun shooting mastery of the handgun means eliminating reactive interference getting the animal out of the shooting process we have to become the robotic shooter we can't eliminate our reflexes but we can suppress them blinking your eyes is both a reflex and a voluntary action you blink hundreds of times a day without thinking about it and you can also blink it will that's because the muscles of your eyelids are subject to both voluntary and involuntary control you can also stop from blinking as a matter of voluntary control you can override or stop reflexive blinking by concentration and practice all of the muscle movements involved with reactive interference are subject to voluntary control we can override them too it just takes concentration discipline and practice we're going to actively suppress the animal with the gun loaded ready to shoot a non target you start the trigger pull slowing down as you approach the breakpoint the objective is not to fire the gun but to find the point at which you lose composure embrace for the shot  it's important that the closer you get to the trigger break the slower you increase the trigger pressure so you can stop the trigger pole at the instant you become aware of bracing for the shot hold the trigger pressure without releasing it at that point and get refocused and recomposed before resuming a very gradual trigger pull if you can't get control and stop the bracing responds release the trigger and start over put the gun down and rest if you need to you can use the support at your wrists like sandbags a crutch works well in the standing position do not support the gun itself do not under any circumstances snap the trigger or allow the animal to fire the gun make sure that you go slowly enough with the trigger to ensure complete presence of mind and composure right up to the point the gun fires  if you can't do this do not fire the gun at all never fire a shot while you're out of composure not only is it a wasted round but you're practicing the wrong thing this practice may sound simple but it will test the limits of your concentration and self-discipline it can mean standing in a firing position without taking a shot for several minutes or more it doesn't matter if you ever fire the gun at all as long as you work on pulling the trigger back as far as you can and holding it without bracing for the shot once you can bring the trigger all the way back without bracing for the shot it's just a matter of being consistent while repeating this until you can do it faster your speed is limited by how fast you can go without losing focus are bracing for the shot you should be able to completely train yourself with one box of 50 rounds if it takes you more than that you're not following the discipline of this method conventional handgun training won't teach you this aiming a loaded handgun without firing it doesn't fit the common mindset of handgun training it's quite literally meditation with a loaded gun  the alternative for dealing with reactive interference is known as habituation it's the process of slowly getting accustomed to the concussion and recoil of the gun over time just by doing a lot of shooting it's why people will slowly improve their shot groups over time it's not the practices making you better so much as repeated exposure to the concussion gets you accustomed to it and gradually reduces reactive interference you could accomplish the same thing just by firing a lot of blanks many training organizations pride themselves on how much shooting you get to do with them we take pride in how much shooting you don't have to do in order to reach your potential after all who's buying the ammo  I've outlined the most efficient approach to mastering the handgun it's about getting to your best in the shortest period of time with the least amount of ammunition it's a transition from low to high power learning accuracy and then moving towards speed the basic skill and safety needs to come first which can then be applied to firearms to learn the Zen of the handgun this is really just a common-sense approach while this training method is best for any new shooter it's particularly well suited for women and minors who tend to be more sensitive to concussion and recoil  it's important to get your spouse or children involved with handguns shooting it's a powerful way to push back against the anti-gun paranoia that the media and public education create make no mistake if our personal liberty is going to survive we need to win over our own family members especially girls and young women but it's critically important to do this the right way I've been shooting for years I can teach my family members how to shoot too often handguns shooter will put a nine millimeter or larger and his wife or children's hands to show them how it's done the rationale is while they may not enjoy it at least they'll know how to do it if they need to this is not a good trade-off because it usually turns out like this gee dad that was fun I can't we can never do that again you may only get one chance to get a gun in her hands don't make it when she'll regret don't bother your family members even if you know how to train them don't good firearm coaches will not train their own family members and they'll tell you not to train yours that's because your egos involved in the process it's either he's dad or hubby and I worry about what he's feeling or he's dad or hubby what is you know a good spouse or child will be concerned about how you feel about how they're doing and not totally focused on what they're doing get them trained but scratch Bubba's discount handgun school off the list  the majority of our female students are women over 40 who share a common story when we asked about their prior experience with handguns these women will say some guy in their life dad husband or boyfriend took them shooting when they were young usually in their teens or early twenties they shot a handgun once and haven't touched one since they've reached midlife still afraid of handguns they got bud we're happy to see these women coming to us for training but between the ages of 20 and 40 they've been voting and raising children maybe they supported the Second Amendment and influence their children that way or maybe they didn't maybe they didn't have strong opinion either way but the point is this handgun training is not just about learning how to use a handgun it's about overcoming fear gaining real-world self-confidence a sense of empowerment and a true appreciation of the right to keep and bear arms handgun training is a life changing experience  the best gift we can give young girls is a sense of dignity and confidence that's based on real-world experience and not unpopular rhetoric the ideal age for introducing girls to handguns is from 12 to 15 they have the mental and physical capacity for it while still being young enough to find it interesting after age 15 you'll hardly get them away from their mobile devices many adults believe that young teenage girls can't handle large caliber handguns this is nonsense females reach their physical prime around age 15 and they can handle a colt 45 as well as an adult male the problem is not in their ability but in getting them interested in doing it teenage girls will rarely ask to shoot a handgun even if they'd like to they probably won't ask because of social pressures as parents or grandparents you need to guide them into the experience because they won't necessarily see the value of it for themselves the challenge is to find a way to get them into training children today are raised with the expectation that someone else will always solve their problems for them and take responsibility for protecting them the idea of handgun training for personal protection is not likely to appeal to teenage girls they want to do things that are exciting cutting-edge things that'll make them more interesting or give them standing with their peers whatever approach you'd need to take with them make it a priority pick a date and make it happen someday never comes time passes quickly and as they get closer to college age the harder it'll become they'll always have more pressing things to do meanwhile public education continues to pile on anti Second Amendment propaganda time is not on your side the reason we are losing the battle for the American culture is because we don't make a stand for what's important we have not been good conservators of what the Founding Fathers gave us we haven't kept the ideals behind the American Revolution our Constitution and Bill of Rights alive in the hearts and minds of our children and grandchildren we've allowed the radical left to hijack public education the public discourse the media and the courts by our apathy silence and failure to act I'm asking you to take action I'm asking you to become the radical activists pro-gun extremists constitutional conservative that the big government status have nightmares about work to get the youth of your family and of your community solidly behind America's first freedom the one freedom that really matters get them into training  you", "WdhQ5mM_Giw": "", "DBxdTkddHaE": "Well this might work too though yeah that's why we're here. Tods Workshop here and today we have got an extraordinary film for you it is arrows vs. armor Agincourt myth-busting.   This is something that we've all wanted to see for a long long time and we because I've got Joe the archer Will the Fletcher and Kevin the armorer to help out This is a day that I have wanted to do for so long, so longbows and arrows versus armor.  There is so much myth and legend around the longbow it obscures what happened, so we're running a series of tests with the best people in the best equipment that I can find and that we've we put together;  they have pulled out all the stops to make the gear for today.  First up we've got Joe Gibbs, he shoots a 200 pound longbow he can do that and it doesn't put him to hospital and and I quote,  \"shooting a 160 pound longbow is easy I can do it all day\".   I mean the man\\'s like half machine you can\\'t get a different Archer than Joe it has to be Joe.   And then we have Will Sherman from medieval arrows he's a full time Fletcher and an Arrowsmith and there are not that many people who are good enough to be able to do that full time and making a living at it you know the passion and the knowledge that he has is extraordinary.  So again there is for me, no other choice than Will Sherman to do this.  And then of course there's Kevin Legg from Plessis Armories.  He's the only armorer I know, who doesn't even own a MIG welder he raises all of his helmets, all of his work is done in the 14th 15th century way, has a really good understanding of the subject and that's not surprising because he does conservation metalwork as well as armory. He's an extraordinary armorer, he's brilliant. We have no predetermined outcome today we're not following a script,  as much as you want to know what happens, we want to know what happens as well that's why we're here so we are going to do the tests and what happens is what you're seeing we're not going to go back and do it again until we get the result we want we are learning here hopefully you will be learning here and we're all going to take this knowledge area of what happens with arrows versus armor on to a better level than we have now.  Now, when putting the team together to do this I needed people that I could really believe in; the last member of the team is of course Dr. Toby Capwell is an author, a museum curator and importantly a practicing jouster and that gives him an understanding of the armor and the weapons and how they're worn and how they were used.   So when Tod called me for this when he's putting this team together to do this experiment I was really excited by that but I also made the point that I think we need to be very specific about a particular moment in history that we're trying to explore.  So we've chosen a specific date because armor changes of course over time so this way we can get a meaningful set of results, targeting one date and what better date is there than Agincourt 1415.   So this is an evidence-based experiment, but what is the evidence exactly?  I mean Agincourt is a good battle to focus on here not only because it's really famous and and and very much mythologized but also because there's a lot of evidence, I mean we know more about the Battle of Agincourt than most medieval battles actually we know the battle site, we know more or less what the numbers were, we know the makeup of the armies we have visual sources of the time which gives us a sense of what these people looked like and how they shot. They're shooting straight, not up in the air we have then the written accounts there are both eyewitness accounts on the English side and on the French side and lots of them.  And then we have the material surviving, there's armor from this period surviving and enough of it that we can get a good sense of the metallurgy, the construction and the way its design.  One of the reasons i want to do this test today is it's like we can take all that evidence we can take our ideas and then we can see what the real physical world has to say about it.  Now we won't answer all the questions that are in our minds but we'll answer some and that's what today is about.   The first step was to get some chronograph readings to measure the speed and then the energy of the arrows at different distances.   Because at Agincourt we knew there were flat shooting, but we don't know what the distance was.   So we're shooting at 10 meters here which is is clearly too short, but it gives us an idea of the maximum power of the bow. So those shots we managed to get a reading for and that's giving us 123 joules or 91 foot-pounds.  The next stage will be to do it 25 meters because that's the distance we're doing the breast plate tests over and again we managed to get a chronograph reading off it and that gives us 109 joules or 80 foot pounds.  Now unfortunately we did go for a 50 meter one but we just failed to get it through the window I don't know why the the chronology wasn't working but we will come back to this in a later film. So we got readings at 10 meters we've got readings at 25 unfortunately it's too hard a shot for this at 50 to get it in the chrono window.  But I mean look at that.  Thats very impressive it's gone all the way through, it's still carrying a punch.  Well it is it's gone through a pretty new straw boss and still 25 mil, an inch, sticking out the back.  But it's not wearing armor yet.  So Joe what have you done to make sure that this weapon is the same thing as what they were shooting at Agincourt.  Visually this is a pretty impressive looking bow I have to say and it sure looks like the things you see in paintings and manuscripts.  The only bows we have left are the Mary Rose bows, so I've been and measured the Mary Rose bows and made a copy of some of the bows that are on that ship.  So basically in in your physique in the weapon you've gone through the process from childhood that they went through in the 15th century.  Yeah, I grew up with a bow shot since I was 14 ,15 ,sort of like a hundred pounds plus, yeah, and I shoot three, two to three times a week so what's the draw weight on this bow? 160 pounds at 30 inches that's pretty heavy, that's a lot heavier than most people will shoot.  Yeah it is these days.  And is that your maximum or can you shoot higher? No, I can shoot up to 200 pounds.   Okay so if you can shoot a 200-pound bow why aren't we using that for the test?  I feel this is probably an average weight for medieval period.   With a 200-pound bow after six arrows I'm knackered, can't shoot a bow but with a 160-pound bow I can shoot all day and I can shoot accurately.   Right yeah and let's not forget after you shot all your arrows you still have to be in good enough shape to get your sword out or your axe or your whatever,  and fight hand-to-hand.  Yeah exactly you don't want to be knackered, you want to still have a bit of energy left so you can yes so you can do the business.   Excellent OK these are the arrows were using for the test I gotta say just having come in and looked at these for the first time.   They're really impressive just as objects, but you know we've got to replicate the right conditions as far as we can, so can you just tell us a little bit about what you've done to make us feel confident that these are the same kinds of arrows that they were shooting at Agincourt. Well the problem we've got is that we haven't got anything from Agincourt to look at, so all we've really got is one arrow from Westminster Abbey which is about 1403 and the arrows from the Mary Rose which number about three and a half thousand.  The Westminster Abbey arrow is a really tiny arrow there's no way they were using that for armor penetration, so all we've got to look at are the Mary Rose arrows.  They have all, well pretty much most of them I've got a half inch shoulder and they taper to a certain degree and the half inch shoulder allows you to have a fairly large head.  So we do have archaeological evidence for the heads separately and we can kind of match that up.   Yeah these are from the Museum of London the exact head is a number 7568 from about 1403, so we're in that rough area.  And some of those heads that date from the right period would basically fit on the Mary Rose arrows? Absolutely yeah.  That's a crucial question; the Mary Rose is still a hundred years later, so you know we have to ask the question how do we know that the Mary Rose is the same as what Henry the fifths archers are shooting. But that's the sort of thing that starts to give us a bit more confidence.  Yeah once you take an actual head and you put on an actual arrow shaft and it fits and the weight remains usable and shootable, you know you're in the right area.  And they're fletched with goose feathers?  These are swan.  Swan? Swan primary feathers.   Very nice.  And they're they're bound into a fletching compound of beeswax, kidney fat and copper verdigris. That goes on first the feathers go on, bind them on, and then you heat up the whole lot and that forms this nice encasing of binding and feather.  And the heads are made out of iron? Yes iron.  Real wrought iron we've got a non-hardened one here and we've got a case-hardened one here.  Just to look at the difference.  And we've got evidence that sometimes they were hardened and sometimes they weren't or...... Not really.  Is it hard to tell? Yeah, because it's such a tiny amount of carbon that goes on the outside, once it's been in the ground for a few hundred years that's gone.  But at least we've got the comparison and you know if there's a drastic difference in performance we can be aware of it. I mean this is not a garden-variety target shooting arrow, this is heavy. How much do these weigh The whole arrow is 80 grams, the head is about 25 and then the shaft makes up the rest of them.  I mean I've been shot with arrows in armor for other experiments, and although they didn't penetrate, they hurt and they were a whole lot lighter than this.  I mean you know this is this kinda scary. Yeah they are scary. So we've replicated the weapon and now we're here on the other end at the the French Knight being shot at.  It's very, very important that we're shooting at something that really closely replicates the reality, so what have we done to get there? The choice of the armor pieces to copy is fairly limited and from this period so so what I found is the Churburg 14 breastplate dated at 13 90. We know the carbon content of the original, we know the thicknesses of the original, the weight and the dimensions. So I've taken all that information and I produced this piece.  So the original breastplate is thicker in this central area here just as mine is here it's two and a half millimeters thick in the center, a robust piece of steel right and then the thickness eases off to the side so at the very sight here we're down to one and a half millimeters thick. There's a number of different things that are important here we've got the shape we got the thickness what about the steel itself I mean what it what is this supposed to be made out of.  Now the original steel was a lot more varied than our modern homogeneous steel it had a varied carbon content but the maximum carbon content we had was a point six percent.  Which seems like a really small amount but that's enough to make it hard but not brittle.  That was the peak so what we've done is we've backed off from that slightly and we've gone for a point five percent carbon steel.  And you have heat treated it?  The original, was air cooled so the whole piece has been heated and then just allowed to cool naturally which I suppose in a modern term would be normalizing the steel.  So this has gone through that same process so the hardness of the steel is exactly the same as the original.  What's underneath? Now underneath this you're still going to be wearing a full shirt of maille; now the maille that we've reproduced to go under here is riveted mail.  Every single link is riveted together and that will increase the strength. Beneath that we've got our representation here of the arming doublet which again is layers of fabric.  Now arming doublet is the foundation garment that you wear over just a shirt or even next to the skin. That's what supports the whole armor, but it also adds a crucial layer of padding and protection underneath as well.  Well that's it it's a sturdy garment. And then even after all those layers, everything you're wearing, it's still got to go into the human body underneath to make a difference that the ballistic gel itself yeah if I press you can see it compresses just as the human body does it's mounted so it it'll give. It gives like a human just like getting shot.  It wouldn't get us anywhere to just bolt the breastplate solidly to to a target would it?  That would have an adverse effect because it would constrain the force.  You need that force to be able to dissipate just as it would when hitting a person. It's just moving the person back, rather than going through them. It's giving that that inertia. OK, First time shooting at the armor.  So which heads are we shooting now?  So these ones are the wrought ones that haven't been case-hardened, so you could refer to them as the soft ones.  Basically the easier ones to make. And there's likelihood is that there were lots of those around. I think so, I mean we simply don't know is the bottom line. Okay well this might work too, though we don't know. It might yeah, that's why we're here. That's the sort of one we want to see what's happened we should carry on Yeah I think so. Nice.  That was full on.  That was cool. That went did he see as well I couldn't see where but the arrowhead flew.  Yeah I mean the shaft went right but the arrowhead went up somewhere. The noise, its really loud.  So first shot through the maille, through the jack, through the body.  So it hit the turned edge and just made a bit of a mark and then skipped down underneath it. That's the next hit; there's a real deep dent there, but it's then skated off without without punching through.  That's kind of a weird one though because it hit really hard but it's not made a mark.  Really it's just kind of hit at a steeper angle and skidded off.  It does show completely what that V is for though to try to stop those ricochets coming up because that's exactly where that would have gone.  I mean it's doing did its job both of those times. And so that's with the soft head, lets go again with the hard. yes I think what I'll do though is I'm gonna mark off the soft so that we know. Just make a mark of what's what. So that's soft number one, here really, soft number two.  So that was the the softer, the wrought-iron heads and we're gonna have a go now with the case-hardened wrought-iron. Ok. And just see if they're extra hardness the hard jacket just needs to bite a bit more they're just skating off I wonder if that will make a difference.  We'll see I mean it should mark the steel better if nothing else, whether it penetrates is a different thing.  Whoa! Square you don't have to worry about them shooting them back at you.  No you're right because there's always that myth about you go and collect them and then you reshoot them back and all that.  No. Not if they hit anything. No. Wow So low and left, so I mean that's absolutely what the curve is there for.  It took a left, absolutely straight left turn didn't it? Wow.  Can see the dent from here.  Holy cow.  That was a big one.  Well there's a message in that isn't there?  Blimey,  look at that. So, that was the first. You just feel a little bit,  but there's a definite mark. It has scored the metal a lot more than that one did yeah and there's this one yeah they are biting more. There's not enough data yet to really say but it seems like they're behaving differently.   Yes, well the obvious thing obviously that we haven't mentioned is they haven't gone through. Right there's that, there is that yes. Mustn't forget that. H1, h2, so H for 'Hard'  and that's the central section Kevin was saying that's 2.5 is that, so that's somewhere between 2.5 and let's say 2 and its done that to it.  Wow.  I'm think we're just going to review the footage see what we can learn from that, see if we can find the arrow heads. Where's the rest of them? So, that one's half disappeared, heads have completely gone.  There's a crack in...right in there.  God, I wasn't expecting that. it's like it's crumpled and part of its broken this broken again.  Yeah well when we look at the footage it might be that that's struck something on the way past.  Got one.  That is interesting, I mean look at the point on that.  You know how steel changes color depending on how hot it gets? And what color are you seeing on the center of that?  Where it is blue.  it's blue yeah so that's like 350 centigrade, Idon't know what that is in  Fahrenheit 500 or something.   That's interesting because when musket shooting tests against armor you can see there's a there's an instant of superheating when there's contact.   Well that's what that's what's happened here, so there's enough energy in that strike, that it has heated the the iron so hot it's turned blue. how cool is that?  Yeah, I don't know what to make of that but it's neat.  I don't know if it matters, but I didn't think it ever happened. So here we got the first of the arrows which is wrought, unhardened. Just clipped underneath you see that wobble shockwave got the gel straight through the maille and the jack, just, just clipped the bottom edge of the breastplate. Ruining somebody's day.  You see that. It moved back a bit and the wave on the gel went right up through the chest. So got the second one coming and that, it's just a strike right in the edge where the armor is so curved that it's deflecting it, which of course, exactly what the armor should be doing. As you can see the arrow hit and then glance up and it's hitting that V rib.  Guiding it away from what would be the the throat.  There's still a fair amount of movement in the gel and that shot too. I mean it definitely knocks our guy back a bit as well. Wow Here we go, case-hardened. Shattered the arrow completely obviously.  Can't shoot that back at anyone. Did it hit the V though Tod?  Lets look at that again......and it just follows it up doesn't it right over the shoulder.  I mean it does show though the mechanism of lucky shots though doesn't it?  If they're not going through the plate, which I think we've shown that they're not. uh-huh People are getting hurt in another way. Glancing. You saw the arrow head go actually, I wonder how far?  Again you saw the head separate from the shaft and go spinning off, but the shaft actually stayed in contact and slid across the surface. Wow, that was good, lets look at that again. It rebounds basically straight off. Yeah it did,  but maybe it's the case hardening, but it didn't skate.  But also if you look at the amount of movement on that when this strikes I think that's moved more than any of the others.  So I mean you can see that I guess from the dent, it really has transferred the energy on that one.  Hasn't gone through, but wow there's some force in that.   And again you can see the armor flex, the ripples through the gel, the carriage moving back, it's all doing what you'd expect it to do.  So Joe, you're looking at that from the archers point of view, what you seeing?  Looks to me like with that that type of arrowhead hardened or not there's no way that's going through that that breastplate.  If you're out there where you targeting? I would just try and get as many arrows into him as I can and hopefully one of them will find the soft part of the whole amor. So volume of arrows frankly.  Yes that what I would do. So Kevin what are you seeing?  I'm seeing a really really well-designed piece of armor.  I mean that's experience that's put the thickness right in the center that you need.  it's experience that's put that V in the front of it to deflect exactly what we saw in the footage.   Perfect design engineering really. That breastplate is obviously thick at the front and it's a good quality steel even if it's not hardened so what about legs arms.   You move out onto the limbs and the armor is half this thickness that makes it more vulnerable, but the curves are a lot tighter so to get a square shot is harder there's another video in there.  So again the volume arrows and I suppose.   We've killed a few of your arrows today Will, so what do you make of what you saw? I could just echo what people are saying we're looking at something designed to stop arrows and it does exactly what it's meant to do.  Whether the head could be more case-hardened we don't know we can look into that perhaps. It's going through maille, it's going through the flesh, obviously it's going through textile armor, but that is doing what it was designed to do. And it's destroying arrows at the end of it, you can't shoot them back at people and they are ruined that's it.  Toby what are you what are you thinking?   Well I'm not surprised because I knew that the armor was gonna do its job.  I think this is this is useful though because it's a reminder that we're dealing with a really complex physical situation. There's all kinds of secondary effects going on and I'm amazingly impressed at how basically all of the arrows just explode.   But then you've got all this wood flying around and you've got heads flying around and and the noise. I think this this experiment helps the imagination, as well just trying to flesh out the real human experience of this, because ultimately that's what matters.   Looking at that breastplate and the damage that it's received, I can't see the arrows going through that now. It's not to say they won't go through weaker bits of armor, like leg armor or a back plate or something, but I think we can put to bed 'do they go through the breastplate?'  Perhaps occasionally, but generally no.  So that brings us to the mechanism of what happens.  How do people get killed?  How do people get injured?  So, it's got to be the lucky shots hasn't it so it's got to be; a strap is broken and your arm is open, or you get one under the armpit.  We saw that with the maille and in the doublet I wonder about the role of the jupon.  The English knew about them and there are depictions of English knights wearing them but it's it's it's not typical where it is typical in France so there's this this usefulness in having more thickly padded textile armour over the plate armor.  I mean that's that's a big thing in this period.  Well lets go an have a look at that. So here we have a upon that's been made by Chrissi Carnie from The Sempster.  Again, like everything else, made as authentically as we can.  so with the layers of the linen and the cotton wadding and the silk over.  This is a really important part of the test, because we know that thickly padded textile armors or jupons were a special French fashion in this period and it was typical for French Knights to wear these these textile armors in addition to their plates they didn't always do it but they tended to. It's certainly more common in the French army than it is in the English.  So we need to add that to the equation and nobody's ever done that before well it it does really strike me as a key element that they wore them over the plate armor; I know you were saying that sometimes they wore them under, but you wear it over and it's gonna radically change what happens when you impact it with things.   As well as swords and maces and such things it'll take some of the sting out but I think it will make a massive difference with the way the arrow strikes as well.  Let's see. Interesting, looks like you're right.  That it has absolutely captured it. Absolutely captured it and for once we've recovered an arrowhead as well. Did the head stay in? I don't know I think we'll find out.  So I mean that was square on center of the breast all the other arrows have just exploded.  So far no blowing up.  Yeah. Fascinating Wow Now look at that, so this is with the jupon over the breastplate there's very clearly something quite different happening, they're behaving in a completely different way.  Should we open it up? The heads again just mangled.  What we got here?  So those are those two strikes there.  And the other one didn't make much it didn't make impression, this is a new scratch there, I think that's what's going on here.  Not much but I mean that really did completely change the characteristics of what happened. but it's not I mean they're not deep dents, they're not worrying.  No not remotely. I mean they're shallow compared to this one. The fact that it's come out its come in here. Is that this one here?  Now that is interesting because that's exactly the lucky shot thing that we are talking about.  If it does that through the fabric....so it's it's gone, it's hit the plate, it's turned and it's gone up under, but again that's heading straight up under the aventail. I think it has hit that actually because it's traveling up at that same angle again, you know if you if you marry it back up it lines right up with the stop rib it's right on the stop rib. The exploding flying debris is very impressive but the the greater risks of the individual that it's hitting is the deflection into some other gap of some part of the arrow.  In sword combat in Lance combat, the skating weapon is one of the paramount risks in armored fighting.  I mean certainty it's gonna help take some of the spank out of a sword blow or a mace blow but I would say quite clearly that's also massively reducing the fragmentation the arrows. Imagine if you had 40 of those sticking out.  I know it's quite look isn't it? Quite the fashion accessory. Souvenirs for Will.  So there did appear to be a bit of a difference between the case-hardened and the uncase-hardened, but it's difficult to tell on that so I how did what was the process how did you K suddenly the heads that we made for this test were forged in wrought iron and in the half that we case-hardened were heated to 850 Celsius or 1500 Fahrenheit and then they were quenched in a compound of organic material like hoof, horn and sugar and that forms a layer of carbon.  There's a lot of variation in there and a lot of cooking times changed, the level of carbon that you get on these arrowheads and there's an awful lot of information that we need to learn about that. So to try and put that one to bed I've got a modern arrow of Joe's here so it's a modern steel case hardened so this is as good as we can get it.  We've shortened the range now to 10 meters to give us everything, the best possible chance of being able to achieve this and we'll see what it does.  Give it a go Lets have a look Well the arrow didn't fare any better.  Its clearly made a deeper impact, not by much, but a deeper impact.   My take on this is that the breastplate is maybe about two millimeters thick at that point and given it our best shot pun intended, with a modern steel case hardened it's still not doing it. It doesn't do anything here, great it doesn't go through, but on the thinner areas of the armor like the size of the legs or something suddenly it might start to make a difference and I think that's where we've got to go looking. I think what we're looking at here is an unanswered question, is does the case hardening really work is it really worth all those extra man hours and the time and the materials it takes the case hardened your heads and we need to go away really and have a look at that and really look into what you can do how far you can take it.  The problem unfortunately that you've got, is you can't go to a book and look at it, it was never written down.  It's that master and apprentice thing, you do it the way it\\'s always been done and you go \"oh great\" and because of that we have to go away and we have to do practical testing and see how far we can take it.  Wow, what a day guys I mean this has just been absolutely fantastic to see this and thank you so much for your input I mean really it's been great and it's answered a lot of questions for me.  It's quite clearly brought up a lot of other questions that we need to come back an answer;  helmets Kevin!  So we need we need to look at that about piercing the breaths and sights of a helmet.   Again with the case hardening but it's it's been fantastic this.  But really it's it's you guys I hope you've enjoyed it too and make sure you comment on it, you know we like to discuss this we read your comments we try to reply when we can and we learn from it so it'd be good to see you there.

of most lotto winners but he took his overindulgence a tad bit too far when he used the backyards of those very same houses as open areas to hold demolition derbies that featured the cars he had bought we already know that he would end up in jail and end up penniless soon enough that's exactly what happened enough said number 13 Etta may or kuu heart California's Etta may or kuu heart after

jail the terms of his probation were the usual no drugs no gambling and no getting into any trouble when he finally lucked out in 2011 and won his million dollars he was arraigned for breaking the terms of his probation thankfully the court asked him to make a moderate restitution and let him keep the rest of his winnings number 11 Ian Gault hrus we have heard about all the stories out there

on one such cash pool that yielded the winning ticket number 9 Vivian Nicholson of course everyone that wins a lottery jackpot wants to spend and spend and spend and when Britain's Vivian Nicholson won the lottery in 1961 her very very public exclamations that she was going to spend it all seemed very apt but of course no one thought that the lady would literally go ahead with her plans to such

Christopher Columbus noticed the coastline on one of his voyages to the New World but it wasn't until the early 17th century that the region was first claimed by French explorers soon there were rumors of a giant city in the interior made of gold called Eldorado in 1763 an official call went out to find settlers for this supposed paradise entire French villages emptied of their inhabitants as they departed for a new life across the Atlantic  but catastrophe quickly struck the ill-prepared colonists tropical diseases began to decimate the population within the first year over 12,000 settlers had died those who survived fled to three offshore islands a dubbed it the islands of salvation because the death rate dropped very very quickly they were able to find a way back to Europe and after they came back to Europe it was confirmed that this was not the land of Eldorado but this was the land of pestilence and this was a land of disease this was a colony of the Damned over the next 80 years others would try to settle this inhospitable country but all efforts failed  in 1852 Emperor Louie Napoleon the third devised a plan to settle French qiyamah and at the same time combat a severe crime problem at home his idea was to send Frances criminals to the distant South American possession regulations were established for this new prison colony including the concept of de blah de blah required a convict who had finished serving a sentence to remain in French Guiana for an equal period of time the first convicts were sent in 1852 and it wasn't long before female convicts were sent as well over the thousand women were transported to the prison camp it is shiny they were watched over by the nuns of st.

[Music] but the plan to encourage convict marriages to populate the colony was doomed from the start this'll still be fun is the main reason that women were sent to the prison colony was because they were condemned for infanticide killing their own babies it seems like a paradox because they were sent to Guiana to bear children the government schemed to populate French Guiana with the offspring of convicts was failing in both OCS vimana in Liberty they began to think that if you married female convicts to male convicts the children could only turn out to be damaged so the authorities stopped worrying about colonization they now worried only about emptying France of its context and installing them in Guiana  the authorities ended the transport of women in 1903 but by then this ill-conceived plan to rid France of criminals and used them to populate one of her colonies had turned into a folly of monumental proportions and it would take almost a half-century for it to be stopped French justice was harsh and often pitiless a convicts journey through the depths of hell began the day he was sentenced to servitude in Guiana prisoners from jails all of her friends were transferred to the town of San Martin in the northern French coast  twice a year a column of condemned Souls would march from San Martin's prison to the pier  specially trained Senegalese troops in combat uniforms and with fixed bayonets guarded the convicts as they walk through the town  since these were men with little to lose French authorities feared a mask insurrection most went peacefully others did not [Music] the column moves slowly forward  policeman hands back the curious who had gathered to watch our departure I looked up and there was my wife Nanette I never saw her again  neither prisoners guards nor public broke in on this poignant moment  everyone understood that these men were leaving the normal life behind whatever  and we've dug beyond show yeah [Music] the prisoners clamored aboard a transatlantic steamer called the margin year [Music] like cattle the men were forced into the hull of the ship  once inside the holding cells only a few hammocks were issued those without were forced to sleep on the steel floor which was often covered in human excrement  there was always a tremendous fear by the prison guards that there would be an insurrection aboard the ship anytime an insurrection was about to foment guards opened up steam hoses inside the cages and that quieted the prisoners down very very quickly for half an hour each day the prisoners were allowed out of their cages for fresh air they had been stripped of all personal possessions and wore only prison uniforms but they did have a secret way to hide valuables money and jewels were kept in small hollow tubes called plans Aleph Emet bra this is the famous plan the metal tube opened up in the middle everything valuable that the prisoner owned was inside there they could even keep small tools - saw metal bars with and in order to hide it they would use the plan like a suppository pushing it up into their lower intestine without having a place to keep one's valuables rather be confiscated by the prison guards or else it would be stolen by the other prisoners and prisoners would sometimes be murdered for the contents of their plans  after a journey of 20 torturous days across the Atlantic the convict ship arrived at the mouth of the Maroni River entrance point to the prison colony of French Guiana we steamed slowly along the bank toward Saluja we all flocked to the portholes of the cage there were exclamations of many kinds look look over there monkeys look apparent flying as I gazed out of the green jungle its immensity frightened me for I knew through it I'd have to take my chance to escape evany Beldon one  the martini air pulled into the dark as sama wrong many of the town's residents were there to get a glimpse of the new arrivals it was the only amusement in this bizarre town on the edge of the rainforest  after the material cargo had been removed from the ship the human cargo of convicts was marched toward the prison in French slang it was known as Lavanya [Music] there was a huge gate over the opening I read in large letters Count de Letran spot assume it's the banya the men behind me murmured in voice that was robbed of all hope so this is where I live until I die  the newly arrived convicts were assembled in the prison's large central courtyard the Commandant of the penitentiary made his traditional welcoming speech you have been brought to the prison colony of French Guiana he said to serve sentences for crimes committed against France behave yourselves and it would be possible to serve your term without suffering unduly first escape attempt had two years to your sentence second attempt at five more but escape is impossible there are two constantly watching Guardians at this prison the jungle and the sea [Music] a few days later our names were entered on the roll velbon wha-la four six six three five the figures burned like a brand in my mind I was the forty six thousand six hundred and thirty fifth condemned man who had arrived in Guiana since 1852  but despite the unimaginable misery and hardship to come the banya could not break Melbourne while spirit he kept dreaming of what only few men had done before him escape from Devil's Island [Music]  Renai Belvin woz second escape attempt was not successful either he and his companions were shipwrecked on the coast of Dutch Guiana hungry desperate and without any provisions they killed one of their group and grilled his body parts over an open fire  Belvin wah declined to eat the flesh  local Indians eventually turned the escaped convicts over to the Dutch police the special military tribunal sentence Bell Benoit to the punishment cell this time for half a year [Music]  bell Benoit's cell was just large enough to fit a wooden bed at its foot the so-called bar of justice  [Music] city of San LaRon where Belvin wah was kept existed solely as a prison city each morning the convicts would leave the compound and go to work in town prisoners kept the streets eerily spotless the little houses freshly painted convict labor helped make sound of raw live up to its nickname little Paris [Music] see I think I said it yeah they raised animals and farm built roads and houses all different chores then after 17 or 18 hours of work they returned to the main entrance of the prison and was searched for weapons [Music]  at night they were locked up in barracks that held up to 60 men the guards rarely ventured into this world it was a place of alcoholism rape violence and fear [Music]  the men were classified by the administration into several categories [Music] well the classification of prisoners started out with what the French called tonsfeldt a that would be the equivalent of felons they were sentenced to French Guiana for a determined period of time or for life a second classification of prisoners were called relegate relegate were petty offenders prisoners who had been sentenced for bicycle theft for stealing food such was the case with my father he was caught red-handed on the highway stealing potatoes and had to pay with the last 15 years of his life spent in the prison camp a convict sentenced to life in prison does not want to have anything to do with the relig a like my father I relegate was considered garbage he's a thief who will die a thief once a prisoner finished his sentence he was considered a liberate a freed person but in reality he was only free to live in French Guiana and struggle each day to stay alive  in the capital city of cayenne a liber8 and played for meager tips in a cafe she was in one situation if you are a citizen of Guiana that owns a small business you can have for a modest feed of the penitentiary administration convicts to work for Healy you're not gonna hire an e Beret who will cost you more who has already done his 10 or 15 years of forced labor and is worn out the last category of prisoners were the Incas or the incorrigibles these were men with unbroken wills men who rebelled against their captors but once labeled incorrigible a prisoner was destined to a faith it was very likely to kill him he would be sent to the much-feared jungle camps  men accustomed to city life in the temperate zone were put to work chopping down huge trees in the heart of the tropics half would quickly break and die  to the administration the men are things to be disposed of honeybell been one [Music] disease would eat away at the prisoners malaria typhus and yellow fever quickly drained the population  at night the men were locked in cage like cells deep in the forest here they were in constant fear of predators  venomous spiders deadly snakes poisonous centipedes and vampire bats that sucked the blood of sleeping convicts  although many tried to escape very few succeeded and a recaptured conduct might have a fate even worse than the jungle camps  the items of salvation a cluster of three islands nine miles off the coast of French Guiana this was the final home to hundreds of the most hardened prisoners Royale the biggest island housed the island prisons administration and also held over 400 convicts here life was an endless repetition  the bell that strikes at dawn to awaken the sleeping man is the one that strikes at dusk recalling us to ourselves  the sound of the bell punctuates our routines we live by it stalling another day no different from any other this is prison life forces lag Holmes  Francie's lagron who was sentenced to life imprisonment claimed to be one of the great art forgers and counterfeiters of modern times though he was known to be a compulsive liar one fact is indisputable he was a talented painter  following time spent in solitary confinement the ground began to paint religious scenes on the walls of the chapel on royale but alone in his cell he also created a series of vivid images of life in the prison colony  I think it really accurately portrays not only just the physical environment but the agony of many of the prisoners take a look at the prisoner with the double leg irons there he is in solitary confinement with a stub of a cigarette from his mouth we're think about the prisoners attached fighting with knives probably over a homosexual lover's quarrel he was telling the world the penal colony was rotten the penal colony was inhuman it was a way that the French government had decided to just get rid of people without thinking about the future or the past  [Music] across a narrow strait from Royale to st. Joseph's Island today there is nothing but ruins hoeper groaned by vegetation but half a century ago this was home to the reclusion or solitary confinement cells rebellious convicts and captured escapees were sent to this maximum-security prison  damp and moldy cells were only 9 feet by 12 the grilled ceiling allowed guards to watch the prisoners from an overhead catwalk to make their punishment even more cruel the men were sometimes forced to remain standing for 12 hours a day if you lifted up your head to look at the guard you felt like a leopard in a pit being watched by the hunter who had just caught you it took me months to get used to that offer sensation the men who planned this place must have been loved some monsters only thought beyond Shire  st. Joseph was known as the island of silence the prisoners were absolutely forbidden to talk  food served once a day in a small bucket supplied only a minimum of nourishment it was here men came to die a slow death  and yet some like the legendary Paul Drewes sank endured this cruelty for unimaginable periods but he was brought into the cells on st. Joseph's and at the end of his first 30 days of imprisonment he spat on the guards so they added another 30 days he threw his bucket on the guards at another 90 days insulted the guards added another 30 days and he spent 11 years in the solitary confinement cells and st. Joseph's half of his 11 years in the black pit dark hole cell which was completely cut off it was just a total darkness his name got as far as the newspapers of France and recite became a symbol for the rebellion of the prisoners sent to the colony  there's a small Cemetery on st. Joseph it was for the unfortunate families of the guards children who died of fever wives who died in childbirth [Music] but there was no cemetery for the prisoners when a convict died the body was rowed out to a point between Royale and st. Joseph's islands and unceremoniously dumped into the sea  almost instantly sharks long accustomed to the taste of human flesh devoured the corpse  eventually the Sharks themselves were caught and fed to the prisoners completing a gruesome and food chain  [Music]  the final island that made up this nightmare prison colony was Devil's Island it acquired its ominous name when the local Amerindians found it inaccessible because of treacherous currents that made the island ideal for isolating some of France's most feared political prisoners fewer than 50 men were ever imprisoned on Devil's Island  the island is only about 1,200 yards in circumference and one can almost circle it while smoking a cigarette it looks like a paradise all covered with palms but in reality it is an island hell where many poor souls suffer eternally in torment her neighbor Benoit  the most famous prisoner on Devil's Island was captain Alfred Dreyfus he was one of the first Jewish officers in the French army anti-semitism in the upper ranks was probably a strong factor in his arrest on charges of treason in 1894 a wave of hysteria swept across France Dreyfus was vilified in the press caricatured as a traitorous monster he was soon tried and convicted of treason based mainly on the evidence of anonymous documents  he was then publicly humiliated stripped of his rank and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island [Music]  alone on the island except for a contingent of guards Dreyfus was kept in a stone hut on the edge of the sea he thought that he might never return might never see his family again his wife's children he suffered the greatest harm that a military men could suffer he was accused of betraying his country in the first year and a half of his confinement Dreyfus was permitted to take walks around the island to receive books and letters and to occasionally speak to the guards but the prison administration became obsessed with the irrational fears in Dreyfus might somehow escape [Music] his conditions were changed radically the solitary confinement cell was built just for him outside a machine gun was mounted for added security this was an excessive type of punishment here is one prisoner alone on an island where Escape is virtually impossible and yet not only is he put in a Cell but he's guarded shackled and constantly watched the only movie ever made of the great French writer in 1897 spurred on by dreyfuses wife and family emile zola published his famous article J'Accuse in which he charged the French military with condemning and innocent men the case now commanded worldwide attention and caused an enormous uproar see diffusivity offer me but I think if Dreyfus had been locked up on an island somewhere in France people's imaginations wouldn't have worked quite the same way if you're convinced like Zola the Dreyfus was innocent that this innocent person was on Devil's Island meaning in hell it would strike your imagination very hard confined to his heart his mail heavily censored Dreyfus had no knowledge of the storm his case had created he passed his days solving complex mathematical problems [Music] but the long nights were more difficult he would write I was shackled in an unchangeable position to my been the shackles which were very tight lacerated my ankles the torture was hardly bearable during those tropical nights [Music]  on the northern tip of Devil's Island is a bench made of stone it is said that in the days before he was confined to his Hut captain Dreyfus would sit here for hours and stare out in the direction of France  I was invited to visit on the 100th anniversary of my grandfather's arrival in Devil's Island and I was very moved of course to see the places where he had spent so much time where he has suffered so much and and looking at these bars and his walls and think that my grandfather had spent so many many days looking at the same wall not knowing when he would ever return to his family so it was difficult difficult for me to fully realize what went through his mind when he was there  in 1899 a new trial was granted and after four years on Devil's Island Dreyfuss returned to France although he was again convicted by a military jury the government yielded to international pressure and pardoned him Dreyfus was reunited with his family finally in 1906 the French High Court of Justice cleared him of all charges [Music] he was reinstated into the army and in a moving ceremony captain Dreyfus received Frances highest military award the Legion of Honor thanks to his wife and millions of supporters Alfred Dreyfus had escaped the horror of Devil's Island [Music]  in French Guiana there was only one thing worse than imprisonment on the islands of salvation the guillotine  nicknamed The Merry Widow the guillotine was assembled often in San Lara killing a guard or a civilian was almost always followed by a death sentence the condemned man's fellow convicts were forced to witness the execution [Music] [Applause] [Music]  prisoner volunteers acted as executioner's and they were often the most despised men in the colony Omri claudia was hated by the prisoners when he walked a condemned man to the guillotine he mistreated him claw Co hit him with his fists swore at him called him a good for nothing but claw Co met a sad end he was murdered by some liber8 they tied him to a tree where there was a nest of ants and covered him with honey then they let him die a slow death burned by the Sun and devoured by the ants  to some men being sent to the prison commoning was a fate worse than death a few survived the ordeal only to come out broken and irredeemable  but there were those whose spirits could not be easily broken for them the only way ever to be truly free was to escape [Music] more than three-quarters of the prisoners in French Guiana would attempt escape there were only a few ways to do this all dangerous escape through the jungle almost an impossibility the convicts become prey to it and perish escape by way of Dutch Guiana must have been handed down and sent back to Saroja but there is the great and magnificent way of the sea and this is the most dangerous of all our nipple burn one [Music]  Renea bell benoit's third escape attempt in 1934 was finally a success travelling by land and sea he carried with him 13 years accumulation of journals and sketches about life in the prison colony eventually bellman wah made it to Panama and befriended the natives the Indians were shocked to find that an escaping prisoner would have all these papers on them completely useless things to carry around well if you had a sea turtle you put that in your back and you'd have enough to eat for three days but here is a man escaping from the middle of the jungle with 30 pounds of manuscript and original artwork from the penal colony he was determined to tell the world about Devil's Island [Music] Belvin woz dream seemed finally to be realized when he reached New York in 1936 two years later his manuscript entitled dry guillotine was published the French government was deeply embarrassed by bellman wah story and demanded his extradition he was forced to flee to Mexico but returned to the US with world war ii erupted in Hollywood bellman wah became a technical consultant on several movies about Devil's Island like passage to Marseilles which starred Humphrey Bogart why should we help you escape I leave that to your conscience in 1956 bellman wah was granted US citizenship by a special act of Congress his escape from Devil's Island had led him straight to the American dream  Auri sherry air claimed to have made eight escape attempts he finally succeeded in 1944 floating off Devil's Island on a raft made of coconuts  Cheri air became a citizen of Venezuela and published his book Papillon in 1968 it became an international bestseller translated into 35 languages later a hit movie appeared starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman but weather papillons accounts are true or not remains a matter of debate VVT did the truth about Papillon about his book is that it's a fine piece of work there is a part of it that really did happen to him it's been documented but he embellished the story with The Adventures of his cellmates and the convicts he met there however sherrier came by his story his prison comedy experience led him to become a very wealthy man [Music]  on November 22nd 1938 the Martin air left friends with 600 convicts it was the last convoy ever to French Guiana  World War two brought German occupation and misery to France  as the war raged in Europe US troops entered French Guiana to prevent it from becoming a Nazi be checked [Music] and though cut off from the world the prison system continued to operate  the French had known for years that the colony was a failure and after the war a plan was developed to shut down the prison  by 1947 the last of the convicts was freed most returned to France he's a leader tycoon defeated big so then they had a lot of trouble reintegrating into modern society because these men had acquired habits that were incompatible with the French Way of life many of them ended up in institutions and asylums they ended their days being taken care of by society Paul Roux sank the man who spent 11 years in a dark solitary cell could not adjust to freedom he told people that he no longer felt like himself in fact in 1949 he ended his life by throwing himself in the dubrow River his mind was still in prison [Music] 300 ex-convicts chose to stay in french guiana they had been away from france for so long that this was now their home by 1965 less than 100 of them were still alive  that year dr. Raja pretinho was assigned to the hospital in San Lauren his home movies of the ex-convicts are some of the last remaining images of these condemned Souls lit that esprit de Saskia met the spirit of the old prisoners very did slavery unikitty there were some who were jokesters and there were others who were rockin tours telling stories about their lives but others were much more discreet about themselves and didn't speak much GIM Chi Yong is great on morphine I remember one man who was always staring into space and from time to time he cried tears running down his face and you could see that this was someone who had been deeply traumatized someone who had certainly suffered a lot but didn't talk about it [Music]  French Guiana today looks upward to the heavens for its salvation this sank got  the European Space Agency launches Ariane rockets from a site across from the islands of salvation luxury cruise ships now make stopovers at Royale where there were once grotesque cells of despair there are now tourists strolling leisurely through the ruins the restaurant now caters to customers who can enjoy a picturesque view of Devil's Island  the colony of the Damned is now a country looking toward the future  if the buying I knew no longer exists it most certainly exists elsewhere the injustice and atrocities I saw are being duplicated at this very moment in prisons everywhere it is important to understand this because the prison is a prison whether it is located in Soho or in Paris and Devil's Island or anyplace else in the world [Music]", "VAIs8VLFbls": "what I'm going to do here is I need to shift this log roll it so that the heart cracks on both sides are level yeah see this is the heart crack through here generally most logs will have heart crack and I want to cut that I'll just make a mark so you can see it easily yeah I want to be able to cut that out when I start cutting slabs so both sides have that heart crack lined up level I can't roll it this way because I'd be going uphill so you'll be rolling it until it's vertical or until it's all real quite a ways to go mmm so this log is about two and a half feet diameter 30 inches and it's a eight-foot log well probably nine for you I usually cut about a foot extra so this is how the pyramids were built and rocks were moved yeah but a big piece of machinery would move pretty easy but just me yeah if highways  Wow so the heart cracks one in each end they're both slightly different to each other with the casting they play twists the log twisted wood it grew probably yeah so you're kind of find the average I'm finding the average basically I want two four inch thick slabs under this to make a big bench and so fortunately the heart's way down here so I'll probably get my two slabs here easily okay the sides off with my chainsaw because I don't need to do all the milling with my Alaskan mill with that because this is all gonna be exterior so I don't want any SAP wood if it was gonna be interior I would rip the whole thing because then you get all that width but the SAP wood really rots quickly outside so you'll cut the outside off and turn it into firewood yeah just like here just like that very cool  okay I should be able to see enough of that now that it's not look at a straight line how often do you have to sharpen the saw well as long as you don't hit during anything with this kind of work not too often probably every year just four or five times I mean cut yeah it's just so that if the teeth are pretty equally cut and the same angles and sharp the saw doesn't start veering to one side it'll make a cut just pretty straight  another advantage ripping the sides off or peeling the bark off yes when you go to use your Alaskan mill it's a lot easier to cut because the bark really clogs up even where your cut is so I won't have any bark on this when I go to make my gonna be really clean  you have your foot under there when you're cutting down that bar is going through can you see it yeah yeah cut the end your foot off you gotta really watch it yeah when you're doing this kind of stuff yeah sure it's happened before  good they okay looks good so what I'm doing is I'm taking the bark up because I want to set my rail to set up my Alaskan male you don't have to do that but it makes it a lot easier just set that just set it up yeah and de nailed it on cuz you got to nail it onto the log yes so harder through the bark so what exactly is this bar um using is what the bar this is just a bar that's older than I am I got it from my father that's probably 70 80 years old uh-huh this is for its uh originally I think was used for setting best put fence post so you put your post in and then you tamp it down like that around the post  multi-functional oh yeah I must have yeah I use it leverage yeah it's just great for leverage I couldn't move his log otherwise yeah that makes it peel off like a butter  the logs been sitting here for months sometimes it gets a little easier to take off okay what I'm doing now is I'm putting this rail that I've made it's straight and each side is parallel to each side on the rail so if I get this set up correctly I'll cut a even slab off of the blog with my mill so what comes into play now are the lines I've made because that means that I can measure down to this level line that I created earlier on each side of my guide here then on each side over there and then I'll be able to cut down to the line with my Alaskan meal so this you call this a board what do you call this as my guide you guys did you make you use this for all your jobs have you made it for this job oh I use this for all of my milling jobs I made this a number of years ago I have another piece that goes on to it and I can cut 25 feet long so this is twelve and a half inches on this side and I have 12 and 3/8 on this side so and shim it up a little and try to get that  twelve and a half so after I get it all Eve equal on each side I'll nail it to the log so on this side you're also bringing it to 12 and a half inches right yeah twelve and a half inches to the line from the top of the board on each side of my guide and each side of the each side of the log so now I'm at 12 and a half here and twelve and F here now I have to check the other side because I pivoted it may have changed mm-hmm twelve and a half inches from the top of the guide in all four positions on both sides of the log so now I'll nail it down and I can use my Alaskan mill great so when you nail it down are you nailing through those shims on purpose through the sham so they stay in place because the Alaskan mill really vibrates a lot and in my brain out so the nail goes through the guide through the shin and into the log  you just feel make sure it's dirty so you had holes there in the guide before so you kind of use the same holes over over and over sometimes it just depends on where I'm nailing it doesn't matter yeah okay now the one thing I nail the other side AII it just to make sure it's parallel and that's the advantage of having these two two sides mm-hmm and they're very close to parallel I could read this maybe a sixteenth of an inch  so if you want a flat slab like how are you determining whether it's completely parallel in Flash well I'm eyeing this edge get backing up and eyeing this edge and see that it meets that edge so it's not tweaked to is not tweaked in any way right and I'm just trying to raise this one edge about sixteenth of an inch right now I have the two sides parallel now great and if this was a longer log if it was say a 12 or 13-footer over put shingles in the center here then I'd nail it there too but this doesn't have any give in this short distance okay I only need two sets of shingles and nails to keep it accurate enough yeah okay the part where I was measuring the 12 and a half inches from the top of the guide yeah on this nailed to the log yeah because now what I want to do is I want to add up twelve and a half inches here before I put that top board on well first of all let's this is the Alaskan mill this is Alaska mill you can buy setups that are aluminum got bars that an adjustable but they get a bit pricey and you can make your own pretty easy yeah this is my Husqvarna that has a 42 inch bar on it I drilled two holes in it and put in a ready rod bolt folded and stays in place pulled it on both sides with what lock washers and then you just drill this so counter drill it so that it sits on the bar its depth thing stuff to like a step yeah so now I have all these different size blocks and I need to add up to twelve and a half inches so I'm at and I need two and a half more inches so I should have  okay there's 12 and a half so I'll just repeat that on this side so is it a particularly strong saw well it's a good table it's an old so I've had it for over 20 years mm-hmm and it's held up really well it's a big saw yeah so this is what an Alaskan mill is it's not like a it's a chainsaw with a set up on this chainsaw with a set up on it sometimes you have two chainsaws one on each side just depends on how how big a cut you're making and how big your saws are you don't have to have this big ax saw you can have a smaller saw you're just gonna be cutting smaller pieces of wood is all  that will cut right down through that line that I have on the log  I used to use just a 2 by 12 for my guide this works a lot better but a 2 by 12 will work this is about how much well this is an age structure Hou sees a plain bored playing to the instruction structures this is like a beam structure so it's a lot stronger so when I go ahead and make this cut I use a gas mask along with iron ear protection because I'm sitting right next to that motor and the fumes come right up at me and they're pretty toxic so it's a good idea to protect yourself from it yeah why more so than with a regular chainsaw well when I'm cutting with the regular saw my head's quite a ways away from the saw head and there's a breeze going through and so the wind is really taking it off I'm not getting it but with this you're really sitting right in there with it okay so now with the set up I have this board will run down the top of this now I'll be cutting right along this line and it should meet on the other side where the line is - no yeah this cuz everything is parallel and I did it with a level no and that's why I needed to shift the log so that the heart crack I was cutting out was the level tooth and then to this board for the ride along the top of that board yes while you're sewing and the bar will will cut right through that line so we'll see if it does yeah okay okay  when I first put the board on I put it on backwards and there's a reason that I have it longer on this side just for safety I like to have the board go past the end of the bar it's too easy for someone else to walk up and walk into that bar when it's when the chains running and get cut really badly so right now we're looking at how it's going to be while you're cutting right and so if somebody walks up they're gonna get to the board before they get to the the chain moving because that'll cut through you pretty fast yeah okay well I'll get the chain saw started now so just hangs on bouncing on the wood  nice come out in the line yeah good very impressive okay so now I'll remove the nails and then we can cut from the surface that I created we don't need this anymore I like how you put the shims in that makes sense they're as thick as the as the blade yeah if you don't put the shims in it drops down on the bar then you're cutting width and it'll bind your chain what you're gonna make out of this big block of wood on my pond where I have the koi I'm going to take two slabs and make a circular bench area  break your foot I can't live something like this how happy to think the top slices what's that how heavy is the top slice gonna stop sighs I would have to guess just 500 pounds I mean this is Greenwood yeah it would probably break your foot or break your leg yeah so you lever it off oh yeah I can't lift it  so now I'm going to go for cutting a 4 inch slab and so now I just change my block setting to 4 inches perfect and they should both be the same yeah so we got 4 inches now  so you have to be pretty handy to want to do this to be able to do this oh yeah it's quite a bit of work for everyone it's not for everybody but on another hand where can you go buy a 21 inch 4 inch slab that's 8 P or 9 feet long of Redwood that's all hard to cut a bench out of yeah these logs over here actually I'm just gonna be cutting into material like the two by they're in stump or by because I'm going to be replacing a d\u00c3\u00a8cadence 20 years old so that you could just go out and buy all right I've got the material here for big slabs so it just makes sense to use it because I had to take the trees down anyway so a lot of your house you would have made the boards actually no I fell the trees but I had a mobile dimension milk up ah that would be just too much to do yeah that's uh I had a twenty seven thousand board feet of material cut up so that was like a look like a lumber yard I wouldn't be able to do yeah the most I've cut off it any one time is about 3,000 feet that's a lot of work  okay now I can cut off of this flat surface that I've created for my next 4-inch slab so you don't need your border you don't need the board you only need it the first time for the guide for the first guide yeah because now I can you look at this it's a really nice flat surface I mean it's really nice straight and flat super plain yeah so you wouldn't use these shingles until you're actually working along you just place them ahead of you yeah yeah just get them in place  mmm mmm mmm mmm  pretty good it's quite dangerous there I mean you're using your your foot it could be you have to be very very aware of what you're doing well it helps push it down there because you are actually pushing it and it's kind of hard to reach over and push with your arms the whole day I know yeah your legs a lot stronger yeah okay we got a slab beautiful so I'll take it off and put it on some stickers they're parallel with each other and so that it dries fairly flat  oh nice board nice board huh ready for another chicken ass and then I should miss C on both sides  wow it's sure looking different around here cutting these logs there's just a little bit more to cut but some of my piles are very close to where the log is so I'm gonna be moving this wood to another location and then I'll finish cutting up that one log there ah sorry it's only about a foot away from your stack of wood right I need quite a bit of room for the saw because the blade extends you know a couple feet so maybe you've got like 30 or 40 boards here since we were last with you oh yeah yeah I cut up this time in a combination of two by and four by I just cut up according to what my usage is going to be yes so I have to replace a deck and so I'll need some 4 by material and then a lot of 2 by so that's how I decided to cut this time so on top of the pile there's like a thinner board yeah what I do often is I cut out the center where the heart goes through because often there'll be a crack through that and it makes the wood not usable so I'll cut like I cut just an inch out here and it's just not a very usable it's not reusable so I just cut that out because I don't want that crack to go into the next piece like this was the next piece uncut and it's a floor boy and I don't want that crack going into it so then I just use it as the cover board I see there's a little crack there in the end yeah crack here you can see it a little more clearly these are a couple more that I'm not you seeing right now cover boards but see this crack mm-hmm see it goes diagonally vertically in some areas and kind of diagonally oh yeah making the wood pretty useless in that area yeah except for a cover board yeah cover board good and I might you recover a little bit of the wood but not much yeah then sometimes you notice that one's even it's one inch everywhere this one goes from about two inches to one inch yeah sometimes the crack that goes through the heart which is typical in most trees you'll get that mm-hmm it doesn't it's not going parallel with my cuts the way I laid out the log it twists it'll twist as it moves through and this one twisted a bit so there was more waste on one side so what I do is I just used my guide again that I have right here when I get down to the heart crack and I set it up on it and then I can cut out a shape that I take more out on one side than the other so I don't get that heart crack into the next piece of wood into your primary boards that you're cutting right so now these cover boards will you be able to use them later or like what happens to them with like how many months will you leave these wood piles stats to season it just depends on what the usage is uh-huh the deck I'll probably use it in a couple months mm-hmm it'll dry some it's not essential that it dries mm-hmm because when you go to the lumberyard and buy redwood to build a deck it's wet mm-hmm it just depends on the usage right the one thing about the cover board though is it does help keep the top piece out of the Sun because the Sun does make it crack more quickly and more more quickly until it's dried to some extent so you leave these board these stacks of wood summer on your property out in the weather for a number of months oh yeah with your hoverboard yeah yeah see what happens is if if this is exposed to the Sun before it dries to some extent yeah this top part will dry before this bottom part too quickly one dry evenly mm-hmm and so that that means that part of the piece of wood is bigger than the other part and so then it starts doing all sorts of weird things because it's not dry drawing evenly yeah great yeah so anyway this is the project almost completed now almost completed and ready for me to just so these remaining pieces with lots of bark on them they can become firewood yeah all the rest of the material that I've left that I've cut from already will become firewood just as I have stacked between the trees and this is the one log here that's very close to the pile so you'll shift the pile of wood and I just don't want to double have to double move it so I'll move the pile of wood where it's gonna go and then I'll finish well it sure is interesting yeah it's an interesting way to produce your own wood if you have it you know the trees on your property and you need to take them down yeah yeah not not easy work no not easy work but then on the other hand you either are going to go to work and earn the money yeah to buy the wood or you or you do this and you have the wood you just get all the in-between stuff wonderful yeah yeah very cool great thanks sure you bet go mill your own wood", "PRgoisHRmUE": "(Low rumble) -The endless expanse of wasteland in Nevada Endlessly towards the horizon.

Navy veterans and a group of brothers Hope you know that what they have witnessed is true. This is their story. Junior officer Jason Turner waiter on board Princeton University in 2004. His personal beliefs democracy and patriotism Guide him to find the truth. -This is the actual event that happened I witnessed it. Aviation Technology Patrick Hughes, He is a veteran of the Nimitz speaking for his companions Who chooses to remain silent. -I am one of them, I have to believe Obviously I've seen evidence like this So it exists. -Top Gun Air Intercept controller Kevin Day And firefighter Gary Warris from Princeton, Serve the combat information center together on board. They looked at them first. No matter what they are. -They want to show themselves no matter who they are. I don't think they want anything related to us. -They literally break the laws of physics in my eyes. These sailors are here for truth and defense. Their story goes back ten years to a time and place This marks the departure of everyone, Their career in the navy, and in their knowledge Limits of human technology Learn about our world. (Dramatic instrumental music) Looking out the ocean to the horizon, The sun, the sea and the sky form an endless beauty. Endless cycle of tides, wind and waves. Here, strange events off the shore have begun. These stories extend the boundaries of our imagination And challenge our beliefs. This is a true story from an account event Sailors and Navy experienced pilots, Professional military service wants members of the world Know what they encountered was real. Even more disturbing, our military did not explain. The answer seems to be everywhere, Like reflections on waves. However, they are there. (Jet blasting) November 10, 2004. 90 miles southwest of San Diego, California In the naval theater of operations, Nimitz Carrier Strike Group and Her Praise Battleships and Airship Wing 11 aircraft, Routine, two-week training. Nearby, a guided missile cruiser, The USS Princeton has been tracking unknown aircraft Appears and disappears from her maturity AEGIS radar screen. SPY1 Bravo radar is one of the most advanced The sensors were deployed. Princeton's main role is in defense of Air Strike Group And Operations Specialist Responsible for protecting the airspace around Nimitz. -My job is for men radar and ID everything Fly in the sky. I also took a position called Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator, if we ever had to go to war, I am the one who is about to launch Missiles and killing. Other than that, I am the air intercept controller Take off the carrier when Super Hornet, I am the one in control And take them to fight and keep them safe home. Had a lot of experience in that room. Captain has 28 years, I have 18 years, And Aegis ships are our latest weapon systems. It has a radar system for spies, Phased array radar system. I am an expert in this area. -In the combat information center Chiefs Day's attention is focused on a group of unknown people Airplane on spy 1 screen. He is trying to find them. -I'm watching, we might be 100 miles, I forgot how far that day was We left the coast of San Diego, south-southwest. A bit off the coast of Mexico, Baja. I started to notice these strange tracks The radar coverage that suddenly appeared under my head San Clemente. The reason I said there is strange because they are Appears in groups of five to ten at a time They are very close to each other. They are 28,000 feet, a hundred Track the knot in the south. In my head I was thinking, you know, That's a little weird. I mean, what, I don't know anything like this. They are not on the COMAIR route, Commercial routes. I am not so worried about it I don't think they are hostile For any reason. I am also another observer watching the same formation It appeared again of course three days, four days May be a point group of five to ten May be 50,60 songs at a time. -Today Kevin and Gary are still looking for answers. They have known each other for more than ten years Since their Navy Day. Gary is a third-level officer And firefighters at the time. -I have worked on the AEGIS computer system The USS Princeton cruiser on the CG 59 missile. I am responsible for CEC and a data recording and maintenance And operate all mainframes running the system. -They have become increasingly frustrated Before they try ID objects with strange air, No transponder, And there are no known flight profiles. -The people working on the Spy one Bravo radar, They have met and said they need to adopt this system They get messy for recalibration reasons Or ghost tracks and they need to be recalibrated Get rid of them. And then once they have done all the recalibration, Taking it on track does not disappear. They are still there, but in fact they are Clearer and clearer. -They are doing diagnostic tests for everything We have to make sure it is not a system failure It turns out it's not, These are actually real objects. My SPY highest tracking quality possible In these contacts. -In this case I actually started recording Play on all four tapes simultaneously. That's it, it's a continuous loop in one, I just Replace them when they become full. -We completely failed to identify these things. It didn't encounter any of any parameters That is well known. -In some cases they seem to come down from space, Then suddenly got into trouble and approached sea level within seconds. Plus the nature of the unidentified craftsmanship None of these have cleared extreme flight observations Very troublesome crew members are assigned protection Aircraft carrier group from air threats. Sunday morning, November 14. Nimitz deck crew is busy launching F / A-18F Super Hornet, Helicopter And E2-Hawekeye electronic warfare aircraft. mission? Air defense simulation, or ADEX Pacific training. The wind is calm and the sky is clear. A near-perfect flying day. At their launch, the black Aces squadron I don't know what happened nearby. -In my mind, that's when I decided I want to be concerned with these objects. We are preparing to launch a bunch of planes In that sky. -Quickhawk climbed up to 20,000 feet And head to the CAP station, About 40 miles south of the airline. CAP is a point used to form a collection point With other planes. -25 miles away. -Fast Commander Eagle for over ten years In the air. His wingman of the day was a new pilot, A young officer on her first carrier deployment She was paired with a senior pilot, System executive of her back seat weapon. He will manage navigation and advanced radar And aim the pod on the plane. (Jet blasting) Overhead from Squadron of E2 Hawkeye Wall Bangers Direct the plane at the station. Bangor provides eye sky command and control During carrier operations. Back to Battle Information in Princeton Center Mysterious objects are back again today is the first time Senior Chiefs have air jets Can intercept mysterious aircraft. -I am looking at these contacts. Captain Smith ordered me to intercept one of them So I just want to go back to the console, I pick the one closest to us, And I was going to let Hawkeye intercept Because they are already in control It's easier. -Captain's day briefing, they agree Send the Hornets. Air interception Princeton controller, Callsign Charlie Radio Hawkeye And control the fast eagle. -Banger, this is Charlie. -Charlie, this is Banger, go ahead. -Shouting to Charlie, how about you? Keep unknown air in contact BRA 270 48 28,000 feet in Bogey. -Charlie goes to Bangor, no. The radar picture is clean. -E-2 radar operators have been frustrated They try to get a radar to return to the unknown Air targets being tracked by Princeton. Even with their 24-foot radar plate, They cannot lock objects. -Deal with Charlie, Transfer Charlie Control of Fast Eagles Flight, Button 13. -We provide them with real world missions. -Charlie to Bangor, Roger. -Quickhawks Charlie, stand by For Real World Tasking. -Charlie Quickhawk, send it. -We aspire to be in the sky The radio is really quiet, I just call him, BRA, This is the bearing, range, height To these unknown bogey groups and basically I'm just telling the crew where the air object is, Their bearings and their range And their height can go by car. -Contact BRA 270 41 20,000 feet Bogey Snap 270. over. -Roger bearing 270 41 miles. -100 paths. -100. -Say country? -State 12,000 pounds. Clean, do you have it? -I'm trying to find a track on it. They sent LINK 16, but my radar picture was clean. -The next wireless phone surprised everyone. -Quick Eagle 110, speak it out. 110 What does your weapon carry? -Tactical Operations Officer, TAO, She listens to the radio name is Elder Lieutenant She just pointed at the blank Quickhawk If they carry any type of weapon One was stunned listening to the radio. -Wings clean Princeton. We only have CATM training missiles They did not derail. -We are in a working environment The last thing we want to do is start shooting stuff. -The controller now has the pilot's full attention. Usually, the squadron does not carry Life regulations during training. -What do you think it is about? -What about the load? I do not know. Maybe a drug athlete or something? -It could be a man, or Cessna lost So-cal. - I do not like this. -Fast Eagle Charlie, contact BRA 160 34. At 8,000 feet, bogey. (Dramatic music) (jet blasting) -Roger, 34 miles from 8,000 miles. Commit, your call, continue. -When the fasthawks approach the target, They don't see any abnormalities Their airborne radar was unable to target. -Quickhawks Charlie BRA 160 10 8,000 feet. -Roger. (Dramatic music) -Quickhawks Charlie. Merge the plot. -Basically what the merged plot means on the radar. You have two objects with the same vertical sky. So when I was looking at a 2D display, It now looks like a radar blob. -The object appears to be stationary. -My speed is 17.7k -The display basically has no air speed. -Hey, did you guys see that? - what is that? -Approaching the target as a Super Hornet, They saw interference on the sea; Its size is about 737, It looks like something may be just below the surface. -100 anchors here. Angel 24. -Roger. -Charlie Quickhawk. -We are watching something in the water. Possibly on the plane in the merged plot of water It's about two miles north of us. -Charlie, Roger. -I'm dropping Angel 14 to see it. -Do you think that is unknown to us? -Not sure. The radar is clean. -As soon as he reaches the merged plot position, The object he was intercepting dropped from 28,000 feet As low as 50 feet above water in 0.78 seconds As I discovered later the next day. -Get closer to marine interference with the arrival of the Super Hornets He suddenly found another ship above. A much smaller white object rectangle Hovering and the dart was just above the waves. Objects are moving irregularly, Seems to focus on white water. The shape is similar to Tic Tac. It is as smooth as porcelain. This is not an airplane. Suddenly, the object began to rise into the air. (Dramatic music) -Hey, it's just my nose. It's almost here! 2 miles. -Strange crafts start to mirror Fast Eagle turn rate. -Tally a bogey 287 for two miles. Angel 5. -The target now is his position at three o'clock Because he kept turning. -He turned very hard at 3000 meters. -We have communication with external speakers In battle so everyone can listen. Then I heard from the radio, Oh my god, my God, I'm engaged, I'm engaged! -He is 1000 meters south. We need to avoid it. (Dramatic music) -Commander is now about a mile away He lags behind unknown craftsmanship as he manipulates his Hornet. It's about the size of F-18, It is about 47 feet long and has no wings. As the fighting dogs unfolded, He quickly turned to dive and advanced his jet Close distance object -Holy! -It jumped! -1000 meters he is ... (Dramatic intense music) I lost him! Do you see two? -Suddenly the Tic Tac rocket passed. It has gone beyond the horizon in a blink of an eye. -I saw it gone 137. No tally. -That didn't just happen. - Say it again. -Quickhawk Charlie, sir you won't believe this But now it's Bogey back to your hat standing and come over. -Return to the area with Quickhawk Ocean interference, objects disappear, the sea Once again calm. Soon they landed on the boat. (Jet engine) Back to Banger on board, the crew has been listening To radio transmission comes from Fast Eagle. The crew has been tracking and intercepting In their advanced display system, it is called CEC. One of the radar operators who wants to remain anonymous Describe hearing fear in the pilot \u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice, He knew it was not drilling. -I have a good friend who flew over Eagle Eye. We keep calling him Roger, Protect his identity because he doesn't want to come Go forward now, but he wants to contribute To verify the story it really happened. So there were five people on the plane. Roger has been sitting in the radar officer's seat This is towards the middle of returning to the plane They depend on each side or behind them How the chair rotates like a window. -Suddenly his attention was drawn to something Outside Hawkeye. He and the entire crew watched incredibly Suddenly formed their E2 as Tic Tac objects Then shoot just as fast away from sight. The crew was incredible. As Banger returned to the ship, the crew wavered. Very unusual events are disturbing, But what happens next still haunts them today. U.S. Navy officer quickly arrived and escorted the crew To a safe space on board. As the crew began to take off their flight equipment, An officer started reporting by telling them, This did not happen And they were given a non-disclosure agreement. They were warned never to discuss the incident again. (Dramatic music) -We are preparing for air defense exercises again So now we get all the squadron launch carriers Because they all got to do their function Check the flight. -Senior Chiefs Day Watched Incredible Tic Tac UFO Respond to upcoming fighters. -All objects in the sky, they all dropped out From under 28,000 feet of sky to 50 feet. -Based on SPY1 Bravo radar system Objects landed at more than 24,000 miles per hour. -Incredible because what usually happens If it is normal aircraft to do so, first It will separate, it cannot bear G power will appear as multiple sonic booms. So this will be a boom, prosperity boom prosperity boom prosperity. There is no sonic boom. -From what I observed, I saw it came from, you know, 30,000 feet above 25 and 25 Below sea level. -Contact. Tag number 042-- -Give me the actual confirmation below sea level Sonar's technology company communications battle Like others with technology say they have a positive track Under water. -They are talking about their sonar guys You know with us i mean i was told Directly it did go underwater, you know, I mean it comes from the air to the water. From what they say it's average You know, about 500 knots underwater So it does slow down when it hits the water But it does not affect it inertia. -After interception, Kevin and Gary Climbed the bridge wing to get better View of objects through binoculars. -We went to the bridge wing to see them Big eyes this is a magnifying binoculars That was the bridge wing of the outgoing ship. -Even if I'm not watching I often participate in battles Anyway, I'm sitting there console, I just chose Closest to our object and i got relatives Carry from the boat. The relative influence of the slaves over the covenant Right height, then see this white light in the sky. -The movement is smooth to unstable, yes. They just move from one point to another. It is always very clear and clean. It always feels like a constant speed, not acceleration. It just needs to go to that point, it decides Do it at this rate and then it will go They are leaving from nothing Then stop at the next point. -Meanwhile, back to Nimitz, Aviation technology Patrick Hughes is working Protect confidential data from Hawkeye's recorder Encountered Tic Tac. -We take out the hard drive. We call them RMC. We call them bricks and they are heavy Like bricks, but they contain software to run Plane, they also recorded a lot The data crew in the air saw during the flight So we take something that moves, we take it out, We went downstairs and returned to our store. -Patrick's work involves tracking the chain of custody Hard drive. -Then we turned on the security and put them in the safe, We have tracking tables so we know What RMCs or what plane. We know who signed them, who put them on the plane, Who took him away from the plane -When he is ready to complete the task, knocking. -Our commander is there. The other two were suitable for what I assumed in flight Air Force officer's career is very certain This is what they have in their hearts, But they were not on board earlier. I don't seem to be on board So I'm not sure how they got there. But the captain basically said I need bricks get off a plane. We opened the safe, we put them in the bag and he took them, He took his two anonymous officials and left. -Officer, with assorted hard drives in hand, Soon boarded the HS-60 Seahawk helicopter and left Nimitz. (Helicopter propeller rotation) Shortly thereafter, Petty Officer Voorhis There are officials of his own visiting unknown Princeton University. -Once they land and everyone then leaves, maybe After 20 minutes I got a call to get all my data Turn over the tape and tell me what I need Reload CEC 'because it was erased. So I flipped everything over the tape, and then they said If there is any blank tape erase everything Otherwise it's in the store. Well, they're the ones in plain clothes. On the helicopter. This is my command system, Controlled the tape from my hand. Helo then left them. So, because we went right back to the flight path. -Tic's connection between Tacs and these men is unknown. How they realized the UFO encounter And how they got to the ship quickly It was also a mystery after the incident. -The video you are watching is a real gun camera Tic Tac's FLIR footage for future flights. This is the first video ever released by the U.S. government Showing military aircraft participating in UFO. Advanced positioning pod, called ATFLIR, Suitable for TV mode and infrared mode. The film has no control surface, no exhaust plume, Uniform thermal characteristics and no visible means of propulsion. Gary and his crew saw a FLIR movie on their console And on the secret LAN on the Princeton. -This is a clearer video. You can see its shape boat and you can see, You know, moved. I try to get a disc to copy it By the time I came back it was closed Our hard drive, turn off the LAN. Yes, it can't be accessed anyway. -Junior Officer Jason Turner also saw higher Resolution version of FLIR movie shows strange Appendages extending from the object. -But some do stand out at the bottom. I don't know if they bend backwards or straight down. -Jason says the video is about 10 minutes Much longer than video Has been released. -I watched this video while playing, I would ask him, This is what we are training or this part Training, we are going to pass, he said, no, This is real life, when I see it, This is a very clear picture, a very clear video, And this thing is going wild, like a turn This is incredible. The amount of G force it will bring to humans This is happening. The jet pursued it like it tried It will run away and leave them. It just disappears and then it comes back Then you will see it. Then it, I mean, it is, it makes a maneuver, As if they were chasing it. It went with them. The incident stopped and turned, but Pew was gone. I mean, this is the only way to describe what it looks like. -This is fucking droilet brother. -They have a whole fleet. - Oh my god. -Just 11 years later, fighter jets from USS Roosevelt This anomalous object was photographed in 2015. -Look at that thing! It's floating. -Just like the Nimitz encounter They are also conducting routine training The pilot met when the UFO team was in. Nimitz encounters secrets kept secret More than 13 years. First-hand testimony about UFO sightings It was actually unheard of from soldiers. Thanks for the bravery and honest description of the sailor And naval pilots who have come forward Their experience, and extraordinary videos That day they took a picture that the silence had been broken. -I dealt with all this for many years, myself. It was not a pleasant experience. Because no one really believes in you. But now things have changed and anyone there That's trying to solve this problem and hope to reach out, Now there is a group you can reach for And get help, support and justification. -Honestly, this is an easy release It's really important to talk about it and how And not just continue to blow it out. You know, someone is here Really need to know and want to know You have support, you know, me and Kevin And those of my other crew who came forward And decided to talk about it. -My role is to describe the story and convince people Yes, this event really happened to these objects It's true, but what they are, I don't know. -It's my thing to wonder what it is. That's why I chose to come forward Contribute to this story because here is a story, More info here Talk to more of us about it, better opportunities The whole story comes together. It's almost our defense Everyone else looks at it, you know, We finally told us the story and people listened. -If you need to know us Or want to talk to any of us, Kevin, Me or anyone else who comes forward There will be an email address at the end of this video You can contact them and they can get us. -If you or someone you know witness unknown Objects from warships or airplanes, Please contact us at the address on the screen. You can stay anonymous. As we struggle to understand these encounters Agree on what they mean There is something farther horizon and limit Our understanding is waiting, waiting for all of us. (Dramatic music)", "_hgV9k_iLw0": "[Music]  hey everybody how you doing in this video we're comparing the 30 30 versus the 308 first the 36 and as you can see here we are going to see how many walls of concrete blocks somebody's gonna say that's a cinder block you know what I'm saying how many walls each one of these rounds goes through every single one of these is a 150 grain bullet these are also the 12 inch blocks not the standard block so they're a little bit bigger than the normal blocks you see around your foundation or what-have-you but 150 grain bullets 3030 308 30.6 let's see what happens put down in the comments down below how many walls you think each bullet is gonna go through and which one you think is the winner I tell you the arguments I always hear the 30-30 guy says more deer have been taken with the 3030 than any other rifle cartridge then the 308 guy says well the 308 has less recoil and you can shoot it more accurately at further distances so I like the 308 then the 36 guy says well you can take any animal in North America with a 36 because you can put a bigger bullet in it but all that aside we're gonna shoot all three calibers all with a 150 gram bullet against these bucks and see what happens let me give you my guess so what is this 1 2 3 I think that the 36 is going to go through 4 walls and the 30 30 and the 308 is going to go through three walls that's it we've got a whole lot more lined up and a pile full of spares in case something happens but I'm thinking three with the 308 and 30 34 to 36 it should have a little bit more boogie on it be going a little bit faster but let's load up get to shooting I'm gonna go 3030 308 36 let's see what happens the rifles we're using for this video are a Winchester 94 30 30 and then to Ruger American rifles one in the 308 and one in the 30 out six all right first shot with the core locked 3030 150 grain  [Music]  [Applause] [Music]  [Music]  we got a cool little cloud of smoke there from the 30 30 let's take a closer look see what happened to the box so if you look at the front there is definitely a clean hole through the front wall that's awesome that's what I was hoping what happened so question is though how many walls did it go through so one two and then it stopped at the third wall so the 30 30 round went through one wall to wall hit the back and there's no bullet to be found if you guess two walls you were correct on the 30 30 let's load up the 308 see what happens all right now here goes the 308 Winchester super X 150 grain  [Music]  [Music]  the 308 actually threw some block up and obliterated my GoPro I'm sure the camera is fine but I'm gonna put that footage in and just leave it there we'll see what it looks like but a lot more massive damage from the 308 check this out I'll put these pins here to help us potentially catch the bullet but you can see that didn't really help us here because essentially the block got broken up into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 pieces and then the very next block looks like the bullet hit there but not really a dimple the 308 went through three walls had a lot more massive shock damage to that block the 3030 just put two holes for it and then OOP that was it the 308 mm exploded the block and went through one more wall so let's load up the 30 at 6 let's see what happens with that one alright here we go now with the 30.6 winchester super exciting  [Applause]  so as you should see there something very similar happened with the GoPro except this time it knocked over the whole ladder kit and kaboodle that was holding up the GoPro but hopefully we'll still be able to have a good shot with the slow-mo on the GoPro but let's check out what happened here with the 30.6 against the blocks walking up to it you can see there's a missing block half of it there half of it there and when you go up to the block the next one there's really no markings on it so and remember there's three walls to each block one two three one two three so what happened with the 30.6 something very similar to the 308 massive shock on that first block went through three walls stopped at the fourth no big dents on the fourth but definitely transferred a lot of energy to that first block went through three walls so 3030 two walls clean holes through the first two walls 308 and 30 out six big massive shock to the first block went through three walls on both of them this was a fun video my guesses were what a little off but let me know if your guesses were right let me know which rifle you prefer the 30 30 the 308 the 36 and why as always thanks for watching the videos guys don't forget to check out all the links in the description down below follow us on all our social media sites if you haven't already don't forget to subscribe to the hoo-dee-hoo channel stay tuned for the next one thanks guys who knew  [Music]", "ad-Kp4Lu6UI": "", "tSRVw_fGrQQ": "recording sir yes okay so I don't think I have come across any video that shows what's inside this Ralph's around this is what military uses and it's one of the most expensive 50 BMG bullets out in the market the regular armor-piercing and full metal jackets they can range anywhere from $2 to $5 around however this one here it's about if you get lucky you can find them for $65 $225 so it's got a tungsten core inside of it inside this copper this is the bullet obviously if you guys don't know what the bullet is inside the bullet which is covered by the copper it's a tungsten bullet tungsten core and the tip is incendiary also explosive highly explosive so everybody always shoots these but no one can actually catch that tungsten I've shot myself many times but it's usually always shooting some sort of a metal to see what it does and somehow even disintegrates or just kind of ricochets and goes somewhere else so to fix that issue I was like you know what let's shoot point-blank because we cannot risk it going even centimeters off because it will start shifting left to right or recurve different direction so we're gonna use this 50 BMG from certain firearms mark star booth designed this for people that just want to shoot 50 BMG and I can't afford to spend over $10,000 on a rifle and it's a super cool and I'll show you this but they also make the they make the semi-automatic just for you right over there that's a 50 B BFG 50 a from several firearms and that one is a semi-automatic this is a single action break action I will show you how it works I put the rifle inside the stand but it's very simple it's just barrel with the trigger house and the stock there's a little trigger here which breaks it open like this it's got a breech you remove the bridge let me actually start from beginning this breech sits right over here so you open the breech you insert your round in there like that and then you close the breech and locks back in like that so now it's locked in strap this in here so it doesn't move and then you just kind of cock it all the way back and it's ready don't strip the wire let me get my rifle out of the way okay let's go you ready swimming in little bit okay perfect okay guys I'm gonna count to three and fire let's go according let me see how long we catch the bullet I think there's no way that you don't think it has to be look Oh oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah is there there was no way escaping that and here's the exit wound from here holy moly look at this Wow look at this thing just buddy look what it did so 3500 sheets there it is right there and here's what happened at the on the end one hopefully the paper doesn't go anywhere  ah ah that's hot there it is that's a jacket so what happens is the jacket gets stripped off so that's the jacket right there no it's hot it's really hot  what is more of it so there's all your jacket so that copper I was talking about that sits and goes over the mixture my count is not wrong three thousand three thousand thousand two thousand three thousand thirty five hundred sheets and there it is your bullet right over there that's paper that was the back or the front  oh wait ah will it go there's two pieces to this just bury wait it went to 35 four thousand Oh an Cup football don't tell me that come on go inside that and go know this no don't tell me that right now it looks like it hit right over here  come on look the exit is in the bag I  have another one you want to try it again cover on I don't think we got room to children with more paper sorry guys okay wait wait why don't we put it a cinder block in them in the middle cinder block will slow down and catch it  we'll put a cinder block and then some more paper in the back because I really feel like it should okay I've never seen it like this look it's cut in half it looks like the tungsten sits right in the middle of that or whatever so something continues going forward which is that tungsten piece I'm not gonna go back until I do this around - okay should we do it let me get another cinder block hold on we don't have see the trucks no I have two more over there oh yeah okay yeah I'll be right back oh yes okay I'll get it  the papers should slow it down and the cinderblock will catch it hopefully and that should do it I can't believe I'm gonna have to waste some more alphas for this but I really want to see what that tungsten looks like so let's go around - let me look one more time before I waste this one all these rocks look like Tung Chung Chung oh you know okay round two you ready I'm ready okay cocky okay good luck guys it's good it's recording we've missed up the cinder block but now probably not gonna find it Oh was this ah yeah let's see this is the jacket ah hot hot hot hot hot hot come on go in the hole the hole in there and the paper visible yeah oh shoot you right there's a hole  Oh cut it oh yeah wait in wait no what is that the other one he's inside that one probably okay so the jacket is here here you sucker God ah ho that's the first time ever I've seen a tungsten core inside does a little piece yeah the little T yeah but look how it look it didn't even break after going through that cinder block or nothing oh it's heavy too this is how you know your tungsten is legitimate you're out first round when you find the actual it's gotta just where you wanna you have a suit nice zoom in on that yeah give you another nice close up the tracer which one person might not tracer because more fire in it I don't like are you it's got fire in the front than the back I don't like fire okay no somehow I broke the concrete just approaching the force we got lucky stuff on the last one oh yeah there it is it's hot mmm it's hot but not super hot what is the fire burn okay so do you see the back yes show the back rock like a you see how the back of this is hollow  you see that how its hollow they put the tracer compound right behind there so at nighttime and you shoot these you can see where they're going and now let's compare that to the tungsten one and you already put that one okay so there they are yeah it's warm now so there they are side by side because this stuff is heavy and they are side by side and that's the video guys I really hope I can find the other tungsten ear somewhere but I don't think I will okay that's it make sure your notifications are on consider subscribing if you haven't I hope you guys enjoyed this

Smith [Music]  [Music]  [Music] okay  I may be out of my neighborhood you boys ready a league alright so welcome to concealed-carry University that was a little bit over the top and it's actually not what I actually advocate that you do that intro was done actually to make a very valid point we want to check some realism back into concealed carry a few years ago I started to see and especially in paper magazines and stuff these photo spreads of everyone's EDC or or pocket dump or or whatever it was all just a conglomeration of just complete not or nonsense nobody cares that much hardware guarantee a famous trainer has nine pieces of flair and his pocket dump Tilley sponsored by nine companies nobody does that stuff these guys carry more hardware allegedly then I carried when I was a load this operator places like Baghdad we might actually get shot also you don't wanna be dressed up like you just stepped out of the 5-11 store with all this other whiz-bang stuff actually bought a gun from a new light dressed up like that one time you look exactly like a target you look like the guy that you wish you'd shoot first because you're undoubtedly carrying a gun underneath your fishing vest anyway so in terms of rejecting some reality back into this kind of last point there's all here people defend carrying like a mountain of hardware because I want to be prepared for everything there's no such things prepared for everything no I've been outgunned with that told my friends with machine guns on a speck of gun ship on station unless you can fit all that in your cargo pants you're not prepared for everything so what you actually can do what you should do is tailor your loadout to your environment the same thing we would do for a carrying tackle kit I'm not going to carry the same thing for a run through the door right off the truck assault I'm gonna carry through I don't know the mountains of somewhere for me personally this is my level one this is my go-to gun this is usually with all that I carry for a concealed carry it's my little 7/11 special just my XDS with the magazine that's in it and a little clip on holster we'll talk about this a little bit more when we talk about a holster selection but nice thing about this one I can stick with my sweatpants if I have to go get you know baby food or something like that my level one is just the gun with the magazine that's in it because that's usually enough level one alpha most days I go to my little stabby knife and it's not gonna be a stabby knife maybe carry a spare magazine to reload and I feel like I said I don't carry reloads very often three level two is where I'm going somewhere a little bit sketchy or maybe I'm going to a bigger city outside of the 1950's here in Idaho I'm going to maybe not quite Detroit or something like that but just a bigger place and I want to be a little bit more prepared I'm a little bit further from health all I do for that is I step up to a slightly bigger gun I go to my Glock 23 had to go to a little bigger holster it's usually carrying a crossbreed so when were paying to put it on it takes a little bit more real estate and it's just a tiny bit harder to keep this bigger gun concealed so also carry the magazine that's in it and I always carry to reload for occasions like that if I can't solve it with 30 rounds of 40 Cal I'm probably having a bad day out of it so that's my level two just a slightly larger gun slightly larger caliber and a reload and honestly that reloaders more not that I run this one dry it's in case you know I haven't have a malfunction with this that I dropped the magazine so I still have some bullets to to finish the fight with now I've also done some protection work things like that that's kind of where I go to a different place this is my level 3 and this is not something I would abdicate for Noble concealed carry because it's borderline ridiculous when I go to level 3 for like a protection detail or something like that I go to an outside the waistband holster and I go to a gigantic gun usually my Glock 34 cuz I favorite capacity / / round lethality when I'm talking about a platform like this go ahead and slap a big ol flashlight on it because why not the outside the waistband carry is also done because when you're on a protection detail or something like that it's more of a courtesy that your guns night out everybody knows who you are it's kind of hard to miss the monkey in $1,000 shoot with a bull genders under the jacket so I don't really care if the gun prints it's not really an issue people already know what's going to happen when I go that level also that's one of the few places that I'll go ahead and bump up to extended magazines and carry multiple reloads if if I'm on a protection detail and I'm not just doing concealed carry stuff I have a lot more of a duty to stand and fight for somebody then I would normally when I could just leave the situation so did it magazines volume of fire basically at that point you're somebody's mercenary this is also the only place in my concealed carry loadout that I'll even consider carrying a handheld flashlight to me this is just a big chunk of metal to keep in my pocket I don't carry this anything else I do carry with the protection gig detail as I might have to do trauma in a car somewhere it's a lot more of a threat and so I go ahead and solve the handheld whereas most of my concealed carry everyday stuff it's completely unimportant that's our level three big old scary gun extended magazines flashlight and outside the waistband on now to me there's really only one more level past that and it gets for lack of a better term I'd call it full retard day and that is all my protection detail stuff combined with actual armor and a plate carrier and magazines and most importantly a gun that's actually good at shooting people I've only ever actually gone to this level in the civilian world one time for whatever reason the business that I'm in added drive from Glock which is north of Atlanta to Orlando which is not very far from where the case was happening on the day that the verdict was being handed down in the George Zimmerman trial so best believe that I thought there might be some resistance on the road and I didn't so I put all the stuff in the front state of truck ended up about 80 because there were no riots at least where I was at at least on the interstate so that's the one and only time that I've gone to level four which is rifle stuff rifle and basically the lady didn't really pay apocalypse I think that should kind of set the tone for what I believe in for concealed carry yeah you can make an argument you can talk about historical that one times that one dude from you know New York didn't have about bullets and as jframe revolvers so you should always carry 17 reloads I think it's completely utter nonsense so in review you said this is it for me most of the time those will get the job done for for most of the threats that I encounter  those we're just a little sketchier maybe I'll step it up to a big boy gun and a couple more bullets if I'm required to protect somebody besides just myself in my family yes I'm gonna go to super high capacity and a whole bunch of rounds and maybe I'll get a chance to hide behind a wall web like back in the old days and level you probably shouldn't be there and you had any sense you wouldn't be rifle and play carry hope this kind of helps keep things in perspective you don't need all kinds of crazy was this stuff and a tourniquet pre tied around your legs to go into combat or the old I've got an IV started my arm and wrapped in duct tape there's no need to live that lifestyle unless you're actually a limited war as right now it's completely over the top and you don't need", "sFlQC8_uPMg": "", "D0MJul9CiU0": "", "nWGYYA6vUbY": "what's up America and then you'll hear from John Farms Academy thanks for watching I am super excited today because I'm going to be redoing my most popular video it's got over six figures and views already it's concealed-carry positions where why and how the difference with this video is that I'm going to do everything live-fire so you're actually gonna see how this all works alive so I'm very excited hope you are let's get started far as the positions go we're going to look at this just like a clock so the front here we're at 12 o'clock 3 o'clock 6 & 9 okay pretty basic there the first position I'm going to talk about is appendix carry appendix carry is where the holsters going to be right up here or some people even like to do kind of a cross draw appendix okay I will tell you this there's national trainers out there that really love appendix carry personally in my opinion I don't like appendix carry if that's how you carry an you carry everyday and you like it fantastic do it for me one that when I carry appendix if I'm sitting it's pointing right at my body which I'm not a fan of you can still do it safely with training I just don't prefer that but most importantly it's super super uncomfortable for me I carry a larger full-size gun four inch barrel and that thing sticks right my grind when I sit down so I'm just not a fan of it but that doesn't mean it's not good whatever gets you to carry every day that's what we want now the next thing we're going to look at is the three o'clock position where you would see most law enforcement or people are going to be wearing it and more of a security type position whether outside the waistband and it keeps everything out here clear obviously not good for concealed carry typically because you have a bulky gun on your side now once we go around here you have where I'm carrying right now which is what we've considered a 4 or 4:30 position ok this is what I prefer mainly because I carry a larger gun and - I just find it very comfortable and I can do all the things I'm going to show you from the ground from seated whatever the case is I can access that weapon very quickly and it keeps the gun very comfortable I'm going to touch on the types of holsters based on where you're going to carry because an appendix holster can be a little different than say a whole search you're gonna carry at the 4 & 4 3 so we're going to cover all that in just a minute there is a couple positions that I would HIGHLY discourage you from and imma give you the reasons why the first one is what we call small of the back okay so if I remove my firearm here small the back obviously is what it sounds like right in the small of your back so they've done what fit right back here hey now clearly uh we always want to have a holster for safety reasons when I keep that trigger guard clear obviously that firearms been cleared and I just want to demonstrate where it is but let me tell you why and to be honest with you it's actually pretty comfortable back here and super easy to conceal let me tell you why I don't like this position okay first of all I do a lot of training a lot of Gracie Jiu Jitsu and I can tell you first hand that trying to access this gun and I'm going to show you in just a minute what I'm talking about is going to be nearly impossible but I want you to think about this if you are in a violent encounter it's not going to be a scenario where you're going to be gently lower to the ground there's a good possibility and get shoved down so think about this do you really want to get forced out of the ground with this piece of steel right in your spine I certainly don't but now let's look at this from the perspective of actually accessing the weapon should we be in that situation I'm on my back now and I see one hit push me down should be down pull me down from behind one of the cases and now I'm on the ground alright so here we are worst case scenario someone straddled me they're on top of me they're going to do some type of serious bodily harm stab me punch me whatever the case is the realistic option here that I'm going to get underneath now let's look down not just to my side but I'm trying to get underneath I got to get under my back get this gun out while I have someone bigger and heavier on top of me to try to access this is really a terrible idea do we have techniques to help with that sure we do but why would I want to do that if I go to even my 4 o'clock position it's far more accessible to be able to access that gun even if I have to move from sit up which I would want to do anyway for distance management but I've been able to access that much much better in anyway this is going to be a bad scenario but I want as many advantages like now you see this in a different angle without somebody had taught me but obviously you can imagine somebody's here once again I have to get my my pelvis up my lower body either get under here again while someone's trying to do harm to me very very difficult even if I sit up I can still access my four but getting back here is really difficult again with somebody on top of me so that's why I'm not a fan of small the back real quick the one that I'm totally I would actually rather you I can't blame the sanest I'd rather you not carry a gun at all then carry off body off body simply means it's in some type of bag purse murse satchel whatever you want to call it so think about this the whole purpose of a holster is to keep this gun oriented aligned and attached to you so that every time you need to get to it you can do so but in real life again you're not going to get attacked from 25 yards they're going to be up close and personal so now that I have this bag right right a gun in you seriously think that someone in my personal space I'm gonna get this bag open it up trying to get this gun out or somebody's here I mean are you kidding me the other thing is even if the bag as a tactical bag and has a holster in there where the gun is solid the bag is not solid it's moving around right so we got to get this bag around get it out not going to happen plus if we don't have a tactical holster we just have this in a holster of some sort let me put it in a bag now the gun can be oriented in any any orientation it pointed in any direction we're going to try to find it so that's ridiculous the biggest thing is this is actually a big danger because if someone's gonna take your purse or your bag or whatever who cares it's not worth your life you have a to them and move on but of course this time you kind of think about it from a criminals perspective they're gonna rip that open try to get your prescription drugs or your money or whatever the case is and take off well what happens now they open it up and they find a gun right not a good center best case you can wish for that case is that you just armed a criminal horse cases they now have a gun so I don't really want to find out where that happens what happens next right and then of course you're also more inclined you something stupid like to fight somebody over it and get really hurt because you know there's a gun there okay so I'm totally against off body carry that once you understand why ever look at types of holsters obviously these are completely different types of holsters they do a similar function but these are designed primarily for comfort in different positions so first and foremost this is your typical appendix type holster it's a very minimal holster it has a single clip what I'll tell you about these clips I'm not a fan of any clips on a holster I would much prefer loops because these clips can come undone but usually on appendix ulcers this is typically what you're going to find so the way this is going to work this is going to go inside where my appendix cure position would be clips onto my belt like that okay and then I would of course have my firearm right into the holster and that's pretty much where I would carry that for appendix and pull mature old and we have the hybrid or the pancake style holster is where you have to to loop the two clips and they're spaced apart and again this is more for my mode of carrying back here at the four o'clock position because it's a bulkier holster as far as overall length but it's designed to kind of contour to the body and dispense the weight with these two clips important thing about the standard type of Eclipse that you're going to find where this actually the belt goes through here and these are actually pretty decent because they got a little a little ledge there these clips are garbage at the end of Dan'l care who makes them eventually these are going to come out I always replace every holster with these loops whether there's a strap with a polymer Stipe or this is leather I don't really care but I like a type that goes all the way around the belt and snaps shut so that you don't end up pulling the whole rig out when you pull your gun out now we're going to go ahead and put one of these on if you haven't seen this done before I'm going to keep my shirt tucked in just so you can see how this is a going together here I also skip a loop so I off the side for you what works best for you but we're going to do these snaps real quick this will go inside your pants okay the let's go on the outside and then they snap shut from the bottom up  just like so once we have that position where we want it go ahead and sense your pants back up okay now key thing this has got to be tight I'd rather you if you have if you're not using an island holster you want you have a leather holster with holes I'd rather you go to where it's tighter than looser okay might be long comfortable but be much more comfortable overall in carrying once I have that got the hard outer shell so I don't need two hands let's put it in there okay little look in my holster and there we go nice and tight sticks nice and tight to my body pull my shirt over we're good to go super important point here you want to make sure you get a quality gun belt a gun belt they don't sell it at Walmart or Nordstrom's or Macy's or whatever okay they saw them when they sell holsters so gun belt super important now here I am in my normal Riggle I'm going to do my little 360 here if if they're at some point there's a little bit that sticks out when I move or something I don't really care printing everyone he's all worried about printing printing printing let me tell you little balls in there could be a cell phone it could be anything and if anybody ever approached me and ever asked me no joke I would tell them straight up it's a colostomy bag mind your own business okay this from a seated position I could tell you right now being in this this little crappy lawn chair this is way tighter than any car I've been in to unless maybe you drive a smart car so this is very confined but maybe I'm in an office chair I don't know what the case is but the point is shooting from the seated position let's see what this looks like as I do with every single draw when I'm coming from concealment always a shooting hand first learn that the hard way from an instructor ten years ago I used to do the old with my reactive hand and pull out and they grabbed my hand and I said go go I know it's like wow so you'll eventually learn that using this to clear your garment is a far better way to go because if you do this normally and you got two hands great if you don't get used to pulling it so this one is gone you still have your your your firing hand but anyway so we're seated position same thing applying so I'm going to come up whether a five-minute car like a pulp with the steering wheel that's great or I'm going to sit forward wherever the case is take my hands at the same time they're moving together I draw up hold my gun out  from this position we're going to do from the ground here again just like someone push me down wherever the case is or I fell down can I draw my gun up and shoot and we'll talk about a little variations that we can do from the ground okay so again go up pull my gun up key thing here I want to clear my leg so I'll keep my legs down they sit up okay now I can also from this position I can get a very stable base locking my elbow to the ground and using this for a very accurate okay if I need a sweet super important lie fire I don't want to cross my limbs so I can still shoot I have to but as I come over to this side obviously I'm shifting my legs okay I prefer to just come up that way I can cover whatever I need to cover and I don't have to worry about my limb the techniques that we use in jujitsu that I apply for this I want to keep my my muzzle forward because I may have more threats coming whatever the case is and obviously I want to get off the ground so what I'm going to do is what we call standing at base I'm gonna use my left hand here to plant on the ground as I keep my firearm I still have a sight picture got the whole nine yards I'm gonna bring this leg behind my arm okay the whole time I'm still got my muzzle forward and I'm getting up if you notice if you would have built a wall right in front of me I could have still gotten up because I'm not going forward I'm coming up and rising too straight onto my threat whatever you guys decide to do as far as appendix 3 o'clock 4 o'clock whatever the case is please guys when you pick a position stay consistent do it over and over and over if you want to carry backup guns and whatever the case is by all means do whatever you like but your primary weapon has always got to be in this location the same location each and every time so when things go south you just react I always say 500 times of repetitions of something before it becomes almost like second nature not to think about these things so again if you're going to carry back here stay consistent here's another quick tip these you can buy these shirts anywhere this is by Wrangler but these are super lightweight they actually are I'd rather wear this in a hot day than tshirt but they're just a short-sleeve button-down shirt they cover everything extremely well they'd write really well real breezy so they don't print even if you carry outside the waistband like I do for sometimes for security type stuff you can actually carry the entire gun completely concealed and nobody knows about and it's super super comfortable keeps you cool remember the reason we do consistency is cuz anything can happen any time you want to be ready", "0dOVZ5TRCUw": "welcome back everybody this is Eric from all spawn and gun I have a very special guest at my range today in case you don't know this is Jerry Mitchell act he came out to talk to us today we're gonna be talking a little bit about intermediate handgun marksmanship basically transitions drawing sight picture trigger control ways to improve speed we could not have a better instructor out here with us today so Jerry won't you take over here and give us an idea what we want to talk about what we're going to work on guys is basic coming out of the host to making the first shot what you trying to do here how to make that consistent what I'm running is my mep open pistol it's the pro series so as an open gun I can do anything I want to it I run a tactical light to add a little bit of weight to it okay and it's magnified it actually quite afford it it has a vortex of raising red dot on it has a magazine well has a tungsten guide rod 26 round magazine so it's an open division gun I can do what I want to it and you can get away with it it fits into the into that package really nice so what I like about them and peas guys it's actually a very functional gun you can change the back straps it comes with three different back straps sure so it fits just about any hand size just so you guys know you know Jerry's talking about his MMP here this is the standard MMP pro series and this is what his gun essentially started life as now his gun does have an aura more cut and that's how you got your optic on there right there right this is the MP Pro Series it's that core model which means it's fit for optics already comes with five a different adapter base it'll take seven different sites available ok aftermarket red dot sights and it also Co witness on five of the the red dot sight so do you want to have a package where you can have either or a table that's just actually going to get guys it's right it's ready to play right out of the box so it's been a great gun oh he's gone alright well let's say let's have a look once you got going on here grab some ears what you want to remember when you're when you draw your pistol out of a holster you wanted to come right up on under your dominant eye you don't want to have to tilt your head or lean or bend your knees so if I'm standing there looking at the target all I want to do is draw the fist through and bring it right into this into the target zone all I want to do is move my hands and bring it right under my dominant eye and a good way to calibrate where you are as a shooter is we do a drill called the bill drill which you come out of the holster and six rounds on one target it counted what what you're doing with this drill it teaches you rapid-fire but it also teaches you how to lock your wrist in the elbows so every time you fire an accurate shot no matter what platform you would have in your hands it's going to return right back to the center of the target if it's not returning right back to the center of the target net holding right so it kind of calibrates you to the platform that you have being a shotgun rifle or pistol so working with a pistol what I'm looking to do here just come out of the holster shoot the target in the middle of six times for a nice little tidy group and see how long that takes all right it's a good way to start go ahead and load her up here good to go good to go eyes and ears guys here we go  holy smokes so just come out of the host to keep it under your dominant eye first jobs are 1:13 what's smoking but it's an average out of a tactical host and not a bad draw so when you go back and review your shots plates we had 17 to 15 a 13 to 16 and 15 and a 15 so we run in six rounds see a total time was so we shot six rounds on target pretty much about eight tenths of a second you know we're not too much work so you saw they're pretty pretty tidy so what I'm without the ultimate expression of that would be to go ahead and do that same performance but two on each of three targets in the same amount of time just as fast as you just did it but in all three torso we had a 189 so let's see if we can run across and do the same drill I got to see this  Wow  well that was blindingly fast so we're right back there again guys so what you saw was the same the same performance but on multiple targets and the only thing I did there was use my time wisely in between shots vision wise and you see it came right across had good hits first targets pretty good oh yeah so what you have to remember there guys good technique is a foundation of all your shooting if you watch I'm gonna stand right here to the side if you watch there if you watch the muzzle of the gun what I'm what I'm trying to do here when I shoot rapid fire is not let the platform jump at all the least amount of this dirt of dispersion you have on the muzzle it's going to amplify greatly a distance so what I want to do is have a technique to when I hold that pistol it doesn't matter what caliber good right here yeah all right you watch if you watch the MOT you watch my muzzle here I'll go ahead and shoot it you didn't see a lot of flip right there I'm just not letting it jump we've got 13 12 another 13 so we're under about 1,300 splits per shot and keeping them on the target pretty easy so what you have to realize good technique is the foundation of all your shooting so if the gun is not consistently coming back to where you're looking and to a site picture you need to tweak and get it back in line hold it with that show them show them how you grip a pistol like you're your grip on the pistol we still get a close-up of that okay you know I think that that's where a lot of people fall short at least in my bit of experience with it is that you really have to have a good purchase on the gun and I'd like for people to be able to see how Jerry actually holds a pistol well the main thing guys has to line up with your dominant eye so when I grab it you also realize that this thing wants to fly out of your hand so the idea of shooting position on any handgun was to have the boar in line with the centerline of your hand then they could only know like pointing then it would only recoil straight back but the way it's designed of course the barrel sits over the hand so if you give it leverage point that's more leverage point where the room say so what you have to do as a shooter is try to get as high on that gun pistol revolver so when you fire it it's going to try to recall straight back so you notice the web of my hand as it as high as possible on the back of the pistol high as you can get it okay all right the thumbs I don't actually do anything with my thumbs they're just end a way so I just let them get some air that's usually what I do to know what happened we try to drive with your thumbs a lot of things can happen especially when you do reloads and working really fast out of the holster so I'll just kind of get them out of the way so with my non firing hand the other thing you want to remember is your your wrist position is going to be critical on how well you can control recoil the more straight up and down there the harder it is the more muscle lock it takes so if it's broken over Center like this it's a lot easier so basically you support hand you just lay it in there you want to try to get as much contact as you can when that grip panel and bring it on out to the target and make the shot well a lot of folks have trouble is actually try to drive the handgun with the trigger finger this job is only to fire a shot and reset the trigger so if you try to do anything else with it it burns the clock and you're not gonna have a fast second shot all right give us an example of that like how would how would someone okay well what I was doing there was as soon as I fire a shot I'm letting up so when I'm coming into the second target I'm gonna on the trigger hard enough to where as soon as it gets in the center it's gonna cook off another shot okay if I do if I do anything different I'm gonna be behind the curve sure so the idea of firing a shot is when you start shooting a handgun the noise and the and the the recoil effect makes the average person want to drive with their trigger finger well they wanted they wanted gern they want to hold it and let it come back down on target didn't release what you should do as soon as you fire the shot and it's coming back into the target zone you should be coming back with your trigger finger should release it during the recoil cycle and pick it back up come back in there and make it hot now standing is that simple what is that hard but what you once you figure out the pull and release you can actually cook them off pretty good I've got my open division magazine of course it's a limited to one hundred and seventeen millimeters so this package hose 26 rounds pretty comfortably so I'm going ahead go ahead and top that Smith & Wesson off come out of the host and put see if I put 26 on the target there see how long that takes all right target in the middle all of that only one miss that's amazing yeah I got to uh I got to looking over the gun there whew and done that in a while that was wicked fast actually picked up 27 so I must have had 27 in that mag after the springs take a set they'll actually hold a boarding that they started with so it's a 4.5 and the first shot was a 102 so 4vets at three three-and-a-half seconds put those rounds on target 27 rounds on target so it's kind of fun that's wicked fast but what I'm looking for when I was actually doing that performance was trying to drive it between the edges of the target you see how the other group was straight up and down now just kind of letting it bounce and just not over overworking it just riding the trick I try to get you know what it is it's almost like you know in my experience shooting machine guns you know if you're behind a belt-fed machine gun you're letting the cadence of the gun sort of take over and then you're reacting that cadence you're just letting the gun do what it needs to do and you're controlling what the guns doing I shoot machine guns excellent but in your case your hand is kind of a machine gun so you're kind of like you know just letting it give you an idea what we did there was an 18 11 to 12 a 15 13 so I start to get back in cycle 12 of 12 it said 17 13 11 14 it's at eleven fourteen eleven that's a pretty hot splits in there 13 this gun shoots so easy that I have a tendency to work it too hard so as I was shooting I had to I was in and out of how hard I was holding it to make this happen I haven't shot at rapid fire in a while so it actually takes a little bit different technique to that just make them burn sure if you if you over muscle it it you you want to drive with your trigger finger so there's that there's a fine line between control and and rate of fire so and that's an amazing display of pistol marksmanship I tell you what I don't know if I want to try after that let's hang them up and give you a rush yeah absolutely I'd love to try it with that crazy race gonna be awesome yeah awesome all right I'm going to try the same exercise that Jerry just did I'm probably gonna do it about double the time that's okay I've got one of these amazing 26 round magazines which I'm gonna have to get a couple of these bases these things are just awesome and they work that's the beauty of it so I'm actually not wearing a holster I'm just going to kind of I guess leave the gun kind of low and ready that way we're keeping it in a safe direction let's try this thing out so I was three to half seconds for 27 rounds let's see if you can do it yeah I don't know about that whatever you ready shooter ready right I'm bi very nice that was a five point seven for use for your time on target 27 rounds so about double the you're actually shooting pretty good okay yeah modes of control was excellent just got to work on the speed the trigger release is killing you because I'm basically what I'm doing is I'm I'm probably moving too much with my foot trigger finger might be I'll tell you what guys this core MMP is just an awesome pistol especially the way Jerry has it set up here it's all in a gun it's not me no it's you I promise you all right we're gonna try again same target all right alright you ready to do it yes shooter ready stand by  not bad he had a couple of them fly away from me but yeah bad that was actually a five point four or five not the same as for the first to the last shot yeah yeah cool what am I doing wrong my trigger finger excited let me see if I can excite my finger one more time all right you got a second yeah absolutely go right ahead I hate to load a magazine you know what I found about ammo when you open a box like that and once the air hits it it goes bad got about a 30 30 minutes shelf life so yo open a box ammo guys you got to hurry up and get it downrange go right ahead it's fast try that you'd hate to see it spoil they shoot the target on the left let me see if I can crank it up a notch oh I'm thinking give me another mag you shyster you're just trying to die I'm thinking now instead of shooting all right holy smokes did you imagine somebody rob robbing a liquor store while Jerry's in there buying a beer or something and you know he just happens to be you know coming back from a match or something and then unleashes out on somebody that's like an mp5 Oh mo how fast was that oh by the way Bob running by myself by my first run oh wow yeah but not as fast I used to be so anyways being modest it's just fun gun fun gun absolutely yeah I tell you that the trigger on that thing is just beautiful and I think that what I tend to do when I'm trying to shoot fast and you can probably mirror this this concept when I try to shoot fast like when I'm running in saiga-12 or something I've outrun saiga-12 before very rarely but like like we were testing ourselves on the s12 the other day and I was dumping like ten shots in two seconds which in theory you think okay yeah that's fast but it's not really when you think about when you look at the slow-mo and you see yeah the technique that's being applied in the fact that there's so much movement there if I'm actually fully releasing weezing again like you said it's like that it's like that anticipation like the recoil forces are almost causing you to break your concentration off a proper trigger discipline and their discipline is hard to maintain in a recoil cycle where you're really watching everything that's going on in and trying to pay attention it's fun to shoot it is fun to shoot it's fun to shoot but I realize that now after watching you shoot and seeing the techniques that you employ and like that just really good trigger discipline I was watching you while you're shooting and and just the way that I mean like you're literally just you're just really like kind of riding that area between the sear and the brake it's just that it's a small amount where you just you found that sweet spot that you got to minimize the motion on the trigger exactly cuz that kills time that's what's taking so long yep minimize motion always faster than the other guy less work is always better that's right yeah it makes them so less you have to measure work delay the least same thing on a draw yeah if you cut out all the stuff that doesn't contribute their performance and just use what it has to what you have to do to get a gun out the hosters gonna look a lot better no doubt more consistent no doubt well um so what would you say to somebody I mean if they were really wanting to let's just say not even get into competition but just say someone wanted to become a better pistol marksman they wanted to really take the time to learn just how to defend their families better how to protect their families in their home or how to how to just be a more efficient plinker even just the home hobbyist basic pistol marksman what would be like the best amount of if I see would give to someone like that to get better well you have to start with accuracy first being able to hit a target consistently and I liked well we train we shoot night matches now so we do like we do low-light and we do highlight we do stressful shooting and competition so the idea is when you're shooting well and you and everything is in your favor well that's that's one thing but when you go to competitions you out of your favor of you or you in situations where you're you're nervous you don't really know the course of fire it's a stressful environment and what that does to you it makes you a better person a better gun handler and that's what you're trying to do when you when you compete and not necessarily that you win the match or you lose the match is that - or that you were better that you're a better competitor you take something from it you know you take something from that competition that makes you a better shooter moving forward and you just take all of those experiences and they compound and they compound and then they integrate into your training exactly and then one day you're you know you were there so what you want to look at yourself more as a gun handler than a shooter like I tell people that take concealed carry class if you if you bought a violin and put it in the trunk of your car and you're driving along the highway and you're and you're passing a violin concert you're gonna go up on the stage and be a violin concert no no you're not gonna be I cannot go better do that so same thing with that handgun if you're gonna buy a gun for self-defense and you never go in a in a situation that puts you off level of what you're comfortable with sure non petition or whatever night training you're never going to you're never gonna have that next level you know you're always going to default you're never gonna increase every stress cause this yourself you have to default to learn so when I when I go out and do drills I always try to leave with something that I can't do I stress myself there then I'll do something that I can do and I get a good feeling they go back to the house and try to figure out why I didn't do this right and I come back and to practice again well guys pay attention as Gerry knows what he's talking about I've been really lucky to have you here with me today I know we're here over the last couple of days Jerry and I have been filming a lot the farm here it's been a lot of fun and I've been really honored and privileged to have a guy like Jerry here because he

you sir thank you we'll see you next time [Music] you", "sFudJ2yIBJE": "this trick hasn't been used for a few years  apparently the digger was popped up when when these trees were just planted so you can see they've grown quite a bit  interesting to see what state it's in  that looks like an old Hitachi  you watch oh-for-three so that's one of the earlier ones that Itachi put out it's going back a few years  Jesus the withers been added a bit she's pretty well rusted out  no keys damn it very grass growing in it I've always got a cover for the exhaust so that's a good sign the engine hoses hopefully hasn't had water on it Rammstein let's do that there's a wee bit of rust there but those two front two are retracted so that's good there should be a right bloody cover covered in oil  looks like the hydraulic pump is still there good  it's actually pretty clean under there surprisingly looks to be all intact  doesn't look too bad all right everything seems to be intact so I think what odo has come up again tomorrow bring some batteries up maybe a bit of diesel and some tools and see if I can get it started it's probably gonna take a bit more than that but we'll see what we can do  it's been a rat's nest under there I suppose the first place to start as drawing get that key Barrow out of there and test the whys behind it to see if it's getting power there so I've tested or was was and it doesn't seem to be any power getting to the back of the keys I'll have to trace the wire back to the battery and see whether breakers I've traced the wiring back to this shutoff relay so this this here was lossless cable so I've tightened that up and now I'll see if is power getting to the key  of managed to get power to the ignition by attaching these buried a was but I can't seem to get the starter motor to engage so after do some more investigating  yes I found some Rhett Trude wiring up under there I've joined it again and I will see how that goes oh she's turning over that's a relief before I go any further I'll change the world and fill up the radiator that's a good sign she's turning over it's not seized up so I do a bit of maintenance on the motor and then we'll try again  yeah the radiator had water or not so I only had to put about three liters on so that's a good sign it's not leaking out of the radiator anywhere it's probably just evaporated over the years still had some oil in it but probably only about three or four liters that's it's got a slow leak and it's mostly drained out over the years yes blackest tar that stuff so I put some fresh oil in it now it's holding oil that's good it took all of that ten liters just the right amount the next job is to flush the diesel tank see if I can get fuel to the fuel pump diesel tankers up there so I've got to somehow reach up there drain what's in it and refill it with fresh fuel hey that's not lift in that diesel tank and it doesn't really look like fuel anymore there's a bit of rust on this yeah that wasn't gonna start quite a bit of water as well by the looks of it  I ran out of power on the batteries yesterday before I could do any more I had a go at starting at priming the pump it was turning over but not firing so I replaced the fuel filter you can see it's got quite a bit of rust and in there so it's got a new filter in there I'll give another Prime and then see if it'll start  okay I'm theory now it should start stopped fresh fuel new oil water the engines turning over so and this is a problem with the both compression or the fuel pump it should run but before I try and start it again I'll check the hydraulic oil so I don't want to doing the pump out if it has all week tout  as you can see the hydraulic O'War looks pretty good after all these years I see a bit of moisture on the cap so I'll drain a few liters off the bottom that'll let all the water out of the tank don't really want water going through the pump  well she's a runner most of the controls work boom the arm and the bucket controls will work but of a leak on that RAM it doesn't look too bad bad results that only one of the travel motors works the side one is all right that one's got no engagement whatsoever this the control stick actually feels quite loose like there's something disconnected so I'll have a look underneath that'll be the problem that linkages come off so obviously a nut that's come off there it was holding it on I've managed to find a temporary fix for it so I just put a bit of tape around the thread so it doesn't ruin it and put a pair of vise grips on there so that that'll hold it in place just temporarily opening another nut up for it tomorrow so see if that works  I went to start it this morning and it wouldn't go so I had a bit of a look under here and I noticed the feed pipe this rubber pipe here had perished yeah right at the where it goes onto the the hand pump so I've pulled it off cut it and put it back on so the parish but that's gone now and reprime knit and it's good again that and I should get it going again yeah it had leaked a bit of fuel but just mainly got a bit of air into the fuel system so that's what wasn't starting obviously these trees weren't here when it was parked up so I went quite foot through there so what I'll have to do is try and work my way up slowly and scrape a bit out of the bank there so I can get through it's gonna be a long day probably getting it out I also checked all the oil and the swing motor the gearbox oil in there and the travel motor gearbox hauls and one of them looks good but the other one seems to have hydraulic fluid on it it's leaking through the main seal of the travel motor they don't need pulling apart and fixing before I do too much work but it should hopefully get me out of here to a place where I can pull it you know strip it down take it out  [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]  [Music]  mission complete I managed to crawl with digger home to my place took two days but we got there in the end had a bit of a nursery with this travel might have started passing out oil so I poked and prodded and this this whole pipe broke off so so rust and through it just and just popped off a whole lot of hydraulic fluid came back through it's just the case drain pipe so not a huge deal but I'm going to take it off here and just swirled it back on so they've got me home anyway this this is the motor I'm gonna have to pull apart because it's leaking from I dropped motor through to the gearbox so there's obviously some seals or something go on in there looks like it's quite rusty so I might end up having to buy another one if it's too shared and soon to be tracking all right maybe a bit less power than the other side but I think these ones are quite prone to leaking through from the motor to the planetary side yeah that's the gearbox side and it should only be about that full with oil but that's full with hydraulic fluid so it means the fluids from the hydraulic motor is coming straight through seals so if it's been doing it for a long time it's probably worn some grooves in the shaft and I might have to get it reground anyway small price to pay for a free digger another thing I noticed was the tracks are obviously pretty worn out you know and there's odd loose squirrels over there but that the tracks are quite quite sloppy so eventually have to replace those and this top roller the bearings are shot and that's just spinning around craft so I have to replace that but apart from that she's pretty good mix a bit of oil but nothing too major got to expect that for a 40-year old digger the arm Ram the seal was shot on that and these ones have a slow leak so I've got three Rams to reseal I should be able to fix it for a listen maybe was that motor maybe less than $3,000 hopefully so cheap digger really and the neighbors happy that it's gone from this property so everybody's happy", "I--m8IuSkS0": "if you want to enter the iPad 9.7 pro giveaway contest all you need to do is leave a like and comment hit a subscribe button and make sure that the Bell notification is turned

[Music]", "NiARHO2d3Rs": "hey guys I gotta tell you I think I have got one of the best logs that I have ever cut on my wood-mizer here with me today this is a figured maple that I had a customer bring me and again they had a difficult time finding someone that was willing to do this log I'd cut some other things for them before and it was one that I asked them if they would please bring it here to me at my home so that I can saw it here and have a little bit more time and more tools and things available at my resources to move it around this thing is gigantic and so as they brought it to me I understood that I was going to have to do a little bit of chainsaw work to it to get this whole thing able to work out and I'm gonna walk here on the log here a little bit and show you just why this is kind of challenging but also at the same time what we want to use as much of our capabilities as possible to cut this thing because there's tremendous value in this figured maple log that they brought me let's take a look at it right now as we approach this log this figured maple you can see all these kind of Burling and figure around the outside of the log and it is absolutely everywhere all the way around it and then when we get to this side you'll see where the customer started cutting it down on the side there and even at that when we look up close you can see oh my gosh look at all of the figure that is in that so this is going to be quite a fun project to do back it up a little bit here and you can see kind of how that was cut now the challenge is a Sawyer when we look at something like this is that first of all it is too big for my mill as it currently is the wood-mizer lt40 that I run can handle a log that is up to thirty six inch diameter that's a bit early around  it's not rounded as curvature to it and other issues that would affect the ability you saw this properly so what I have to do is I have to go ahead and get out the chainsaw and do a little bit of work clean up where they started cutting and cut that off and I might take that and turn that into some bowls or something because it's not going to be really useful for lumber but I think that we're gonna have a good time today cutting this up so let's get started [Music] as you can see now that I've cut that it is certainly a lot straighter I've gotten rid of that bump on the bottom as we walk around here you can see the color difference from the old to the new from what I've cut there so I'm gonna go fire up the skid steer and tip this thing over I'm going to try to set it on the mill and it's going to take a bit of craft to cut this one down let's see what happens  [Applause]  [Applause] [Music]  [Applause]  now that I have this awesome maple log up on the mill I have to go about starting to cut it so this is now approximately chainsaw down to the maximum diameter that this mill can handle you're gonna see that I'm gonna have to still rotate it and take cuts around the outside just to get it to a reasonable working size and they're still chainsaw marks from the other side from where the customer had cut it across before so there's a little bit to work around but we have a lotta log to work with here so there's going to be a little bit of scrap but there is I think we're gonna have some very beautiful wood in this [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music] well guys I got to be honest I thought after I did don't tell my wife how I did this video and it went crazy with I think we're almost at 2 million or over 2 million views now but I would kind of be done doing stuff like this um little wood dust in my mouth but this is the kind of thing those videos have a lot of power in the fact that they bring me work I get to do that other people would never get to do and have a lot of fun doing it so let's continue cutting this log [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Laughter] [Music]  [Music]  [Music] I want to share something with you guys about cutting a log like this a little bit of insider information some of you watch this video because your Sawyer's yourself and you like to see different techniques and you like to see how other people do things some of you are new to saw milling and you want to know if certain things are possible if you can really do them ya with enough motivation you can do just about anything and with enough time and enough chainsaw chains and gas and lubricant you can pull off just about any job jobs like this are difficult and one of the reasons is because of all the work you got to put into them but there's always a point in time when I know I finally got the job licked and that's when I'm reaching this point that I'm about at now you eventually reach a point where you've got it straight enough and you've made enough cuts around that now you know from here on out there's probably not going to be any more chainsaw work there's probably not going to be any more funny rotating the log around or anything like that and I think that I'm just about there now so let's go let's finish it out  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  okay if you can see here on this last cut I hit a nail right there and shiny thing right there and that nail will dull blade so I need to change the blade out right now to finish cutting this log  all right so this log is officially a pain in the rear now I thought I had hit a nail but it was very robust whatever I hit and I'm trying to dig this out of here now to see if we can figure out exactly what it was it is stuck in here but whatever it is it's very substantial so I'm gonna go get another tool to try to pry this out and cut it out of here all right this is the picture of what it is here you can see that is a thick metal strap that is embedded into this log I have no idea how far it goes through all right well I'm gonna keep going on this let's see where I get all right after digging in this for a little bit longer I discovered that this metal strap has a twin there's one right there and there's the other one so I'm gonna have to make an executive decision here I realized that this is really too far into this log to be able to cut this and have any success without going through every blade that I have and so the decision that I'm making now is that I'm going to cut this log right about here cut down with the chainsaw in the hopes that those straps are going that direction and then I can cut the rest of this into short stock which should be just fine for whatever purposes that we have in mind for it well guys this log is what we call a butt kicker there's nothing else that I can say about it that metal strap in there is going somewhere I cut it where I thought would be a safe distance away from that strap and I got about four inches into it and I obviously hit metal so now my chain on my chain saw is ruined so the next thing to do is to try to cut even higher yet - probably like about another six inches above that and see if that metal strap is continuing to go up there I have other commitments today so I got to come back to this for you watching it will make a difference but for me I got to come back to this that's supposed to rain all day tomorrow and I work outside cover of the mill up at night and so it's gonna be a couple days until I can even get back to this so then I'm gonna have to resume recording for you all when I get all my stuff together and be able to do this so we're two sawmill blades in hopefully the third one I put in is the last and I'm just saying this is what you get into when you get into some of these large logs that come from a person's house or neighborhood you will cut into it relatively speaking you'll cut ten or fifteen years into that log and then you'll find something that someone nailed or strapped in there from I don't know 40 years ago and there you go so we'll come back to this and you'll see me in a second which will be a couple days take care guys okay I felt inclined to say one more thing before I come back in a second to finish up this log don't give up sometimes things are just difficult and there's a lot of life lessons to be learned and this is one of those don't I don't get this hardened when this stuff happens it doesn't bother me it used to but it doesn't bother me anymore because there are serious lessons learned in something like this and so much better than this victimization ideology that seems to exist today where everybody thinks they've had a hard life but have really overcome nothing except for maybe the sofa in their parents basement this here is stuff that grows life in commission and it grows good character and so these are the kind of things that I want to raise my kids in maybe not sawmilling but I want them to know that when things happen you don't blow up and you don't get irritated but you fix the problem and you move on so there you go there's the moral of this whole story let's finish this log  [Music]  [Music] okay guys it's time to show you why this wood was worth saving this is something I know that you all want to see look at that you can see guys all the figure that's in this wood is just absolutely crazy now I got another big piece that I want to show you here real quick here's another couple pieces  [Music]  here's some close-up shots look at that just absolutely stunning hopefully you can see that  one thing the sawmilling business has taught me is about never giving up every now and then I'll get some young guys that are working with me and we'll ask them the question about halfway through the day when they start thinking like oh my gosh this is really tough and moving these heavy boards is awful and I'll ask them this one question I'll say son what do you think sawmilling is about and has usual I get kind of a dull look in the eyes and I say sawmilling is about winning every time that you approach something you're going to run into difficulty you know I think that work is about teaching life lessons as well it's not just about monotonous labor that goes on and on and is this mind numbing thing that you never get any enjoyment out of work should be enjoyable and it should be a challenge and you should have a lot of joy in overcoming those challenges and so that's part of what I've learned about doing this business it's just finding joy in what you do yeah it can be difficult work at times but it's worth it and so that's why I've kept doing this over the years this maple log was absolutely beautiful and it's a shining example of why it's worth putting in the extra effort sometimes to get something that's really worthwhile guys I hope that you've enjoyed watching this video if you like what you're seeing here please go ahead and

be there to kill you the sniper first sergeant james gilliland longest kill shot with a 7-6 2 caliber rifle seven tenths of a mile once the individual takes that step and crosses in lon then he comes into our world he comes a target Gilliland and shadow team a 10 man Army sniper unit watch insurgent activity from Heinz throughout the city they rack up 276 kills in six months  one of the biggest techniques that we use to find where our next targets we're going to be it's directly related to deer hunting turkey hunting which observe an area just like a lot of hunters doing preseason take mental pictures of what you're seeing what you can and can't see from what angles you start learning the players just like 800 would learn you know what animals are in his hunting area watch everything and you just kind of remember in your head we knew pretty much everyone in the town and then for some reason a lot of one would wear masks which was a big giveaway I don't know why they would even do that yeah you see a guy in a ski mask in Iraq it's that's a bad guy shadow team sets up its main hide on the rooftop of the opie hotel overlooking route Michigan the major roadway through Vermont it was the tallest building in the city so obviously we had 360-degree observation we were pretty much on the roof in a what we call a crow's nest  Gilliland preaches two things to his team multiple weapon engagements and body shots  aka center mass holds basically center mass is just under the breastplate it would not only give you a larger target service to hit but also it can be used as a desensitizing in a way that you're not looking at the individual instead of picking out a facial feature to engage you were picking out a shirt button in the sniper game everybody wants to think that they had shot it's the way to go I wanted to get away from that especially in that environment there were multiple targets regularly and if you wasted the time to take two well aimed headshots you could have taken five body shots and then come back and either captured or re-engage and kill the enemy  we were probably engaging up to three or four targets a day sometimes more we moved them back further and further into a point where they wouldn't do anything within 800 meters of us because they were scared of us we heard many times nas was Iraqi force nigh / and we adhere over the intercoms of the mosque and stuff blah blah blah can ask and ask and ask constantly I think it was always just warning people that we're out there which helped us because honestly fear is a big factor over six months shadow team clears their sector IEDs but the real danger will come from the rooftops we were over watching one of the line companies that were doing cordon search in the industrial area yes to the north side of the Opio tail a common practice for a lot of units to get the best observation they can get they would go to the rooftops of buildings and when you do that you scowl on yourself just like you can see a single tree on a mountain if it sticks up above the mountain and that's essentially what these guys were doing they were making targets in themselves I call down I was like hey you tell Jason and he's to get down and you know lo and behold a few minutes go by and he'd be standing up again with a couple of other guys I call back down there's a cake you know you can feel Jason he's get back down everybody can see him if I can see where I'm at everybody else can see him  when I saw this going on for the third time I picked the radio up right as I was gonna go to takea to tell them like hey you need to get those guys down one more time right before I push the talk button is when I saw him jerk and he fell we're providing overwatch and then you hear over the radio man down someone just got shot by an enemy sniper so we are just glued to the scopes looking everywhere trying to find the sniper so we start looking at the hospital and start going saw the sniper in the window on one of the top floors I noticed on the fourth floor there's a single individual standing in a bay window I could clearly make out a longer barrel collision the cough type rifle we knew that from our building to that hospital was twelve hundred fifty meters or seven tenths of a mile from our observation post the rifle I had in front of me was a standard issued in 24 siper rifle  the enemy snipers 1367 yards away the distance of 13 and a half football fields nearly 500 yards beyond the maximum effective range of Gilliland's m24 the perfect intent was not to make a one-round clean shot it was to add that distance suppress the target in 24 has a loophole in three alpha scope that's that fixed in power with mil-dots and a bullet drop compensator you correlate the number to the amount of hundreds of yards that you're going to shoot I turn a turret to ten to shoot for a thousand yards a quick calculation estimated the bullet drop decided that I needed to hold about three mils over the target to compensate for the drop at 1367 yards each mil dot represents four feet the great distance in severe drop the bullet due to gravity and drag means Gilliland must aim 12 feet above the target and also in doing that had to allow for the wind which will push around as well as spindrift as the round is flying through the air and spinning the force that is caused by the actual spin will cause it to rotate up and away from the centerline of the board much like a top it would eventually start moving in the direction of the spin it's the same way for the for the actual bullet it's measured and it's pretty constant so you can use a formula to account for that Gilliland aims or holds off eight feet left of the target to compensate for a light wind and spindrift this compensation is known as Kentucky windage the crosshairs were completely off target whatsapp was comfortable with where my site was a squeeze around off  I noticed the target grimace and then he fell back and didn't see him come back up again after the guy went down I turn around looked my spotter s did you see that the report came back there was a single individual male on the fourth floor balcony with a single gunshot wound to the center of the chest the angle was pretty pretty severe so the bullet actually entered at one part and stopped somewhere inside the individuals body there's so many factors to a shot like that  in over a distance like that it had to fall just perfect it was one a million shot Gila lads kill shot it's seven tenths of a mile with his m24 sniper rifle

"5D-nAZv2Ars": "", "9pgx_VPmJx8": "", "xYemnKEKx0c": "So this story begins: I was at a friend\u2019s house She had on the library shelf a copy of the DSM manual Which is the diagnostic and statistical guide for mental illness. And it contains every mental illness that exists. In the past, in the 1950s, it was a small, thin booklet. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, Now it is a 886-page directory. It currently contains 374 mental illnesses. While I was reading it, I was wondering if you had any mental illness, It turns out that I have twelve of them. (Laughter) I have generalized anxiety disorder, This is necessarily known. I have nightmares disorder, Which is put under classification If you have frequent dreams that you will be pursued or declared to be a failure-- And all my dreams include people chasing me on the street Shouting \"You are a failure\" (Laughter) I have problems with the relationship between parents and the son, Which I blame my father for. (Laughter) I'm joking. I'm not kidding. I'm joking. And I have the disease. And I think it is a rare fact Have disease disease and generalized anxiety disorder, Because disease disease makes me feel very anxious. Whatever it was, I was looking through this book, Wondering if I was more crazy than I expected. Or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose that you have any mental illness If you are not a trainer to work professionally in this field, Or maybe the psychiatrist profession has a strange desire To label what is considered normal human behavior as a psychological disorder. I didn't know which of these two things is correct, But I thought it was a rather interesting idea. And I thought maybe I was supposed to meet a psychiatric critic To get his point. So I ended up at the lunch table with one of the Scientologists. He is a man named Brian He runs a special operations team of Scientologists Determined to fight psychiatry, wherever it is. They call the CCHR So I told him, \"Can you prove it to me Psychiatry is a false science that cannot be trusted? \" He said: \"Yes, we can prove it to you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said: \"We will introduce you to Tony.\" I said, \"Who is Tony?\" He said: \"Tony is on Broadmoor.\" Now, what he means by Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It was known as the \"Broadmoor Sanctuary for Unreasonable Criminals\". There they send serial killers And people who are unable to help themselves. Then I said to Brian, \"What did Tony do?\" He said, \"Hardly anything. Hitting someone or something like that, Then he decided to claim madness to get out of prison. But he claimed madness very well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor No one can believe that he is sane. Would you like us to try and get you to Broadmoor to meet Tony? \" And then I said, \"Yes, please.\" So I took the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn irresistibly at Kempton Park, Apparently, this is what dogs do when they're anxious-- Irresistibly yawning. And we got to Broadmoor. I was taken through a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate To the recovery center Where you can meet patients. It looks like a giant hampton The whole place has peach and pine trees and its colors are comfortable. The only glaring colors are the red color of the emergency button. Patients began to move in. They were a little full and wore cotton sports shorts And they seem easy to comply. Brian whispered Scientology to me, \"They are under the influence of medicine,\" Which is considered to be the worst thing that could happen in the world. But what I thought was probably a good idea. (Laughter) Then Brian said: \"Here's Tony.\" There was a man walking inside. He did not look fat, his body looked very good. He was not wearing these cotton sports pants, He was wearing a striped suit. His arm was outstretched Like a man exited from \"The Apprentice\" He looked like a man wanting to dress up Convince me that he is very sane. Sat down. I said \"So, is it true that you occupied to reach here?\" He said: \"Yes, yes. Of course. I hit someone when I was seventeen. I was in prison awaiting trial, My cellmate told me, Do you know what to do? Call madness. Tell them you're crazy. They will send you to any of the many hospitals. Where the nurses will bring you some pizza. You will own your PlayStation. \" So I said, \"Well, how did you do that?\" He said, \"I asked to see a prison psychiatrist. And you've watched a movie called \"Crash\" Where people get sexual pleasure by bumping cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \"I get sexual pleasure from bumping cars into walls.\" So I said, \"And what else?\" He said, \"Oh, yes. I told the psychiatrist I want to see women die Because it makes me feel normal. \u201d So I said, \"Where did you get that from?\" He said, \"Oh, from Ted Pandey's autobiography That they had in the prison library. \" In any case, he claimed the disease very well as he put it They did not send him to Wathira Hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the moment he got to this place, He said he took one look at the place, asked to see a psychiatrist, He said: \"There has been a terrible misunderstanding. I am not mentally ill. \" I said, \"How long have you been here?\" He said, \"Well, if I had implemented the sentence I was sentenced to imprisonment for my original crime, I would have taken five years. I've been to Broadmoor for 12 years. \" Tony said it is very difficult to convince people that you are sane To convince them that you are crazy. He said: \"I thought it was the best way to look natural You may be by talking to people naturally about natural topics Like football or what is shown on TV. I am subscribed to \"New Scientist\", And recently it had an article How the American army was training hummingbirds to smell explosives. So I said to one of the nurses, \"Do you know that the US Army trains hummingbirds? To sniff out explosives? \" When I read the medical notes written about me, I found that they wrote: \"It is believed that bees can sniff out explosives.\" He said, \"You know, they are always looking for Non-verbal signs of my mental condition. But how do you sit sane? How to put a leg on the other in a rational way? It is impossible. \" And when Tony said that to me, I thought, \"Am I sitting like a journalist? Should I put one leg over another like a journalist? \" He said, \"You know, on the one hand, I have the tendencies of a serial killer like Stockwell Strangler The \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" usurper is on the other side. So I tend to sit in my room a lot because I find them terrifying. They consider sitting for a long time in the room as a sign of madness. They say that this proves that I am lonely and arrogant. \" So, only in Bordmore, the unwillingness to go out and walk around with the serial killers It is a sign of madness. Anyway, it seemed completely normal to me. However, what do I know? When I got home, I sent an email to his doctor, Anthony Madden. I said, \"What is the story?\" He said: \"Yes. We accept that Tony claimed the story of madness to get out of prison Because of his hallucinations, which seemed vulgar to start with Which disappeared the moment Broadmoor entered. However, we have evaluated it. We have decided that what he is is that he is upset. \" And in fact, fake the madness It is precisely the kind of cunning and manipulative behavior of the disordered. She is on the list; cunning and manipulative. So claiming that your mind has something wrong It is evidence that your mind already has something wrong. I talked to other experts, They have said that the striped suit - a classic disordered mind. Speaking of points one and two in the list of symptoms; Sweet-spoken, superficial personality charm and a transcendent sense of self-worth. I said, \"Well, he didn't want to mix with other patients?\" Classical disordered, this is evidence of great feeling as well as a lack of sympathy for others. Hence, all things that looked more natural in Tony It was evidence, according to his doctors, However, he was ill in this new way. He was disturbed. His doctor told me, If you wanted to know more about psychopaths, You can go to the Psychopathology Training Course Run by Robert Hare, the man who invented a list of psychopathic symptoms. And that's what I did I went to a psychopathic discovery course, And now I'm certified-- And I must say, I am very skilled-- As a discoverer of psychopaths. Here are the statistics: One in every hundred ordinary people is psychopathic. Well, there are 1,500 people in this room. Fifteen of you are psychopathic. Note that this number increases to 4 percent From executives and businessmen. So I think there is a very good opportunity There would be 30 or 40 psychopathies in this room. A massacre could happen at the end of this night. (Laughter) (laughter) So Herr said that capitalism is at its extreme Rewards psychopathic behavior-- Lack of sympathy for others, sweet talk, Sly, disingenuous. In fact, capitalism is in its cruelest brutality, It is a physical embodiment of psychopathology. It is like the type of psychopathic That is affecting all of us. Hare said to me: \"You know what? Forget this person in Broadmoor And who may, or may not be a paranoia. who cares? This is not an important story. The important story, he says, is \"they are psychopathic companies.\" You need to interview some psychopath companies. \" So I made an attempt. I addressed people at Enron. I said, \"Can I have an interview with you in prison To find out if you are psychopathic? \" They did not respond to me. So I changed the tactic this time. I sent an email to Dunlap \"Electric Saw\" Originated since the 1990s. He was involved in companies that fell and cut 30 percent of the workforce Simply referring entire American towns to ghost towns. I sent an email to him and said: \"I think you have a very rare brain defect That makes you special And interested in predatory spirit and not to fear anything. Can I do an interview with you? About your rare brain defect? \u200b\u200b\" He said: \"Come.\" Then, I went to the great Dunlap Palace in Florida Which was filled with sculptures of predators. There were lions and tigers. He was taking me through the garden. There were falcons and eagles. He used to tell me: \"There are sharks.\" He was saying this in a less sinister way. \"There are also more sharks and more tigers.\" It was like the Kingdom of Narnia. (Laughter) Then we entered his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlop was being brought in to rescue the companies that went bankrupt. He was laying off 30 percent of the workforce. And he would often fire people from joke, For example, one of the most famous stories about him, Someone came to him and said, \"I just bought a new car.\" He replied, \"Maybe you have a new car, But let me tell you what you don't have, job. \" Well, in his kitchen, he was standing there with his wife Judy And his bodyguard Sean. I told him, \"I remember how I told you in the email Could there be a rare defect in your brain that makes you unique? \" He said: \"Yes, it is an amazing theory. It's like Star Trek. You go where no one has seen you before. \" I said, \"Well, some psychologists might say This makes you ... \"(grunts) (Laughter) He said \"What?\" I said \"psychopathic.\" And then I said, \"I have a full list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I pass it on with you? \" And he seemed very interested against his will, And he said \"Okay, go ahead.\" I said, \"Okay, a transcendent sense of self-worth.\" And what I have to say is that it was difficult to deny it Because he was standing under a giant oil painting drawn to his person. (Laughter) He said, \"Well, you have to believe in yourself!\" I said \"manipulative.\" He said \"This is the leadership.\" I said \"shallow expressions: Inability to express the extent of feelings. \" He said, \"Who wants to be burdened with some trivial feelings?\" So, he was passing the points on the psychopathic list Mainly turning it into \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" (Laughter) But I noticed something that happened to me on the day I spent with the Dunlap. Whenever he told me something he looked normal For example, he answered \"No\" to juvenile delinquency. He said he was accepted to West Point, They do not accept people with a history of events at West Point. And none answered in short marital relations. He only got married twice in his life. Acknowledging that his wife mentioned in her divorce papers He once threatened her with a knife. He said that as long as he wondered what the taste of human flesh is, But people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages at the height of verbal quarrels His second marriage lasted for 41 years. So, whenever he tells me about something that might seem non-psychopathic, I say to myself, well I won't put this in my book. Then I realized that by being a psychopath observer It has turned me a little into psychopaths. Because I was striving to squeeze it into a box that reads psychopathic I was striving to know him as crazy as possible. Then I realized, my God. This is what I have been doing for 20 years. This is what all journalists do. We travel around the world with our paper notes in our hands And we are waiting for jewelry. And jewelry is always a ceiling In the characters we meet. And we sew them together like medieval monks. We leave natural things on the ground. This is one of the countries that diagnoses many mental illnesses far more than the reality. Bipolar disorder in children - children four years old They are classified as bipolar disorder Because they have tantrums, Which makes them score high on the list of bipolar disorder. When I returned to London, Tony phoned me. He said, \"Why didn't you answer my calls?\" I said, \"Well, they say you are psychopathic.\" He replied, \"I am not psychopathic.\" He said \"Do you know what? One of the paragraphs in the list is the lack of remorse, While the other one on the list is furtive, manipulative. When you say that you regret your crime, They say; exactly like psychopathy Cunningly claiming that he feels remorse while he is not. \" It's like magic. They turn everything upside down. He said \"I have a trial soon. Can you come to it? \" I said well Then I went to trial After 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go out. They decided that he was not supposed to be held indefinitely Because its high scores on a list Which could mean that he has above-average chances of a reversal. So they let him go out. And outside in the hallway he told me, \"Do you know what, John? \"All people are somewhat psychopathic.\" He said \"You. I. Well, obviously I am.\" I said \"What are you going to do now?\" He said: \"I will go to Belgium Because there is a woman there I dream about. But she is married, so I will make her separate from her husband. (Laughter) Whatever it was, this was two years ago, And here is where my book ended. In the last 20 months, everything was fine. No bad thing happened. He lived with a girl outside London. It was, according to Brian the Scientologist, It replaces the past time - which I know looks sinister, But it is not necessarily doomed. Unfortunately, after 20 months, He returned to prison for a month. He got into a fight in a bar, as he called it-- Which ended up going to prison for a month, Which I know is bad, But it is at least one month that means whatever quarrel, It was not so bad. Then call me on the phone. Do you know what? I think it is right for Tony to be outside. Because we are not supposed to know people about their craziest limits. And what Tony is on is that he's semi-psychopathic. It is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find complexity, Where you find humanity And where you find the truth. Tony told me, John, can I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. \" I did not go. If you were me, what would you do? Thank you (clap)", "XPbCw9pV90c": "you  our next segment will be on criminal assault pre-incident indicators my goal here is to give you those four or five seconds before an event to give you a chance

be very beneficial this took place in I think Miami you can see very early the morning about 138 in the a.m. you see that car across the street they just pulled up presently from the driver side passenger door a man will come out and he walked toward the intersection  pretty busy busy street in that timing and watch you cross the street he starts Beering off to the left a bit here comes our victim she is clueless until he starts pistol whipping her strips her purse from her dick then obviously seen her earlier then moved to the clinic intercept for the cutoff now she's in pursuit while wearing heels which is a common response and not necessarily a good one and they effect her escape now this guy turns the corner and there is a woman in the street saying I just got robbed contrast that incident with this one this is New Orleans the Big Easy this guy crosses the street and she's halfway down the block before he noticed and he before he can react now you're gonna notice here he was actually pulling a pistol from felon carry let me back that one up again you can see this watch him you see how he looks up the street before he crosses that is his witness check who's gonna see this max on the other potential tell or clue would we get moving discussing later in detail pre instant indicators criminals will frequently conduct a form of interview and there are three types observational conversational or confrontational the observational interview the observational interview is merely the criminal observing his corrupt surroundings looking for people manifesting a behavioral pattern which their experience has led them to believe that person would be easily victimized the classic case heads in cellphones jamming out to hear bugs back in the day reading papers the interview conversational it can be what says they will approach you say hey can I ask you a question who's had that what time is it could have a light probably the most nefarious is a low a bill like a dollar bill sir so you draw this and you're processing like what why is this first thing moving toward me and during all of these it can be like hey hey can I ask you a question with that movement towards you to close that distance a confrontational interview will be just that hey what are you doing here to shock you in getting action engage your response for their next step if you're back in their face they'll have to recent they'll reset and rethink if you meekly take it well that's going to only further encourage their action sudden appearance aka he came out of nowhere now this young lady is leaving a gym in pink I believe with Pennsylvania that guy had set out there for hours waiting for someone to victimize he's wearing a sunglasses at night she's not paying him any attention she's probably I can wear that he's even there he reorients on her he strikes her from behind I don't know how that resolved the last I saw of that case they didn't think she knew him it was just literally the random act of violence but she was unaware he came out of nowhere an attempt to fix you in place you ever walk down the hallway and someone's walking towards you and you moved to the right and they moved to their left then you moved to your left and he moved to the right and you'll say like thanks from the dance and you'll move past them well it can be much more nefarious than that  he blocked her movement if someone's blocking your movement left or right left or right when they're moving towards you they want you to stand at that spot for a reason they intend to victimize you there  these next three the weight shift the de personalising stare and distraction when people square off to fight or throw a bull drop that foot back next to the weight shift they're orienting their body mass in a position that can throw a more effective below the de personalising stare because you're just a piece of meat I'm the wolf and you're the rabbit and then an attempt that distraction you give me the classic look down look right this next video manifests all three there is a stare in the distraction and loading up proximity is part of all these events maintain that arm length and a half distance a healthy young man can throw a blow from nowhere in hundreds of a second an abrupt change of directions or reorientation we'll watch this video from the Big Easy New Orleans these three men are walking down the street it's again early morning hours behind they're just walking down the street behind them will come these two ladies you can see shortly a sudden real reach a tree orientation interaction back toward them from the assault  it's a person acting now this this young lady I like her she throws a punch BAM and y'all she's like oh we're not done with this and she's gonna chase after those guys the big thing there though was the sudden turnabout associated movement some years ago I was taking a persian/farsi class in downtown DC so Barney Farsi I went going to class get my stuff on Google off to my truck and go home well on this particular evening I come down the steps and I can remember turning to the left it's not quite dark I think it was like summertime about 7:30 or so and I was conjugating the pershing verb to see in my hand walking back to my truck and in front of me were two gentleman a sidewalk when facing me when facing away and they were holding a very loud animated conversation as I walk toward them about 20 feet away the guy facing me nodding his head the guy facing away did that yeah I thought oh here we go that was movement associated with my arrival on the scene that was nonverbal communication like okay here he comes I got it and I will Mick I felt a flush of recognition like I know what this is Eureka yeah then I got angry like no way all right let's just do this I put a folding knife in my hand did not deploy the blade walked up upon them swung out to the right one of the two probably got it was facing away reached out I think he's trying to grab my collar but because I moved he got me on the shoulder my briefcase came up knocked his arm off I deployed the Brig and go get my hip both of them and they looked at me like this they looked at me with each other with me so damn well man we just wanted to talk I got nothing for you went back to my truck put them put put the blade away drove home that neck and that next morning I woke up shaking and how stupid was I let me count the ways it was easily 20 feet I had to do anything other than keep walking toward those two but I was angry next we should class I say hey did anyone see those two guys head him woman to the class long time DC resident and she said oh yeah I saw them I cross the street correct answer doctor April when you take us class violent acts and violent actors and other such courses any offers we'll talk about heuristic completion and you're just people will just stay locked in on that one pathway and you have to break that knowing about aimlessly  suspects approached the victim before running from the location surveillance cameras in the downtown area were able to capture the robber the victim was transported to an area hospital to be treated for the injuries one of the things we need to look out for is what is outside the normal realm it's not normal for people to hang around street corners in the middle of the day that it's like a lying hanging around the water hole he's not there to enjoy the swimming he's waiting for a victim and that was a blind corner the guy moved into it turned the corner running to the ambush the next one is the identification the we this is one particular that's a women are need to be aware of and say for instance you are tasked loading putting groceries into a car and your approach and you hear the what we are not just to let you do that we're not gonna let you carry that the forest teeming Ted Bundy was expert at this for steaming the we the identification and now yet to pull it apart from the from the eternal pursuit like boys great weather today stuff like that no that's one thing but like we are now going to your house that's an indicator posturing  [Music]  now I'm using dogs here as an example of how people can behave I mean either one that can move to the other side they could have at each other but they don't really want that they embark at each other now that can be an indicator though it can escalate to actual violence when people start posturing urrrr melissa's go up language goes up tone and volume change working just the posturing either way we need to extricate ourselves from that situation mad-dogging or people holding your gaze by staring at you we've all seen a draft part with the velociraptors well what was happening on the flanks are behind you it's also can be used as an escalation eye cause like what what are you looking at what are you looking at  what you think say that advant someone can be trying you like oh I'm just paste out my apology service I didn't mean to offend you or that's a great shirt dude where'd you get that something to deflect off that course banging out or multiple threats here's an example on the street you watch these three guys approach this woman how they expand out to divide your attention and your capacity to respond  and she holds on to her first hurting you'll see example after example I'll show you one layer of a of a concealed-carry citizen confronting a man armed with a knife and keeps backing up he's been essentially being a hurting here's another example what that can look like you have one man the confrontation in the front hangs up I'm a boxer in a boxer he says he's backing up he is totally focused on that man in front of him and he keeps backing up he's being hurting  running with ambush  scanning I mentioned earlier that scene from New Orleans the guy gave that quick look around his list check here's the other example this took place in DC some time time ago I think she was 98 years old obviously limited mobility give her age she has her cart and this guy has her pin pegged in and he's gonna tell her over and dominate now watch if he looks around he was looking for potential witnesses on his escape route  she knows what's coming  now I cannot verify it but I'm told he didn't last long in prison rapid breathing someone's ramping up that body alarm reaction respiratory rate goes up heart rate goes up hitting hands hands behind backs hands in bags hands on your shirt hanging hands at Target clacks I look here at my friend I'm gauging my distance and direction to him for me to make a move or if I'm looking at one part of his body I'm looking at his neck or a throat to throw a blow their  grooming gestures and people get anxious and get it ramped up Megan particular they'll start making grooming gestures and they're undergoing that mental calculus am I gonna do this just nervous energy burning off you see this you start to make space the number one indicator deliver it movement towards you this took place in the gas station in Houston you look off to the two guys on the right and they form up their team and they move toward the victim almost like wolf stalking their prey one guy stopped short engages in conversation for distraction the second one uses the train as it were or the gas pump comes around achieves surprise and the robbery is on  now that's a getaway car  and he's what happened I don't understand they came out of nowhere  another example of direct movement this is a rather famous case from Florida this is ATM surveillance footage on this man is due to an ATM transaction he looks up periodically he sees the little silver mirror thing and the camera is you sees this guy approaching but he's missed a lock into his transaction and this guy closes the gap he sees him coming and there's a pistol so he looks back over his shoulder and mother is actually in the car he throws the money John the classic and then he attempts a half-hearted attempt just snatched the gun he shot once in the chest staggers about collapses and dies in front of his mother  he was absolutely locked into that transaction he took them back in his car even though it was quite obvious there was it was a coming he just had to complete that mission so here's a whole list what I've talked about some of these are more consequential than others the movement towards you the sudden appearance others are taking two or three like one or two or three at a time may not indicate an impending event but you need to be cognizant on what can be going on around you one of my World War two heroes Joe Foss fighter pilot famous for saying looking around doesn't cost anything and to health you have it ain't Joe had it right that concludes this segment I look forward to your comments below thank you", "ldSta87yzMU": "What's going on Luke from USACarry here. A couple of weeks ago we covered a story out of Pennsylvania about a woman that was jumped by two other women in a Walmart she did have a concealed carry permit during the attack she pulled her pistol shot at the two other women attacking her as they fled about four or five times and then she proceeded to follow one of them down one of the aisles and shot her twice hitting her in the finger and the thigh she was charged with attempted homicide and aggravated assault at the time we didn't have any surveillance footage so we were just going by the reports that we read it didn't sound like it was justified since all the reports we read said she was shooting at him as they fled and obviously chased after one down an aisle but now we do have the surveillance footage so I figured let's take a look at that see what actually happened I want to note that the district attorney has dropped the attempted homicide charge so now she's just being charged with aggravated assault so let's take a look all right so this is surveillance footage so obviously it's not gonna be that great of a quality report said she was with another male who tried to break up the fight but was unsuccessful so as you can see there are two guys on electric carts here talking to each other this guy in the black is the guy that tried to break up the fight I don't know if she was with both of them but for now you can see they're just having fun on the electric carts neither of these guys are disabled as you'll see in just a few minutes so I guess if somebody that was disabled needed the carts they're kind of screwed because these guys are just having fun anyway they're sitting here talking and then skip forward a little bit right about here this is where you can see the girl that was attacked come into the frame now she's walking looks like she might be on the phone and right here you can see the two these two girls walking right behind there maybe four or five feet behind her the one goes around this little kiosk and then comes back around pauses for a second the girl that was attacked will just call her the victim she starts walking down this aisle the two guys on the electric carts drove off the two girls that attacked her are still following her one of the girls that attacks her reaches up like she's pulling something off the shelf right as the other one comes around and hits her as soon as she hits her the other one starts attacking her and the fight ensues then it spills out right in front of the surveillance camera it looks like one's kind of dragging the victim down by the hair which I'm assuming is the hair you'll see flop on the ground here in a second right there what's impressive is while she's being attacked and dragged down she's still able to reach into her purse and pull her handgun and as soon as that handgun comes out everybody goes flying so I'm not sure if that's one shot right there or if they're running just because the handguns out but then we'll kind of go frame by frame from here so you can see how many shots there are based on the recoil so that's could be one two three four just can't really tell if that's four or five shots I believe it was reported now that she shot five times but as you can see she was definitely shooting as they were fleeing you can see that their shots and the other two attackers are not even on the screen anymore they each went down separate aisles the problem is she's now chasing after one of them one of the attackers is apparently coming back at her which that doesn't make sense to me I wouldn't be coming back at somebody that was already shooting at me I assume that's when she fires two shots because the girl goes to the ground she gets hit in the finger in the thigh and then the quote-unquote victim decides to go looking for the other attacker because she goes down that aisle 22 Jersey decides to pick up her hair and her purse and then they both meet back up and they decide to grab her other items and just head out of the Walmart so like I said when we first reported this it sound like it wasn't justified because she was shooting while they were fleeing now was the first couple of shots justified since it happened so quick now once they're off the screen she continues to shoot at him so they're obviously no longer a threat now that one attacker did come back at her and wound up getting shot but as a district attorney said she chased after her which that's something you just don't do she needed to just get out of the situation and call the police so what do you think was any part of this shooting justified maybe the first couple of shots but once they fled obviously not it is interesting that the district attorney did drop the homicide charges and now she's only being charged for aggravated assault it's gonna be up to a Common Pleas Court to decide if her actions were in self-defense or not so let me know what you think in the comments below what would you do so

pound bug-out bag.  In any sort of a bug-out scenario, when your main goal is to put distance in between yourself and whatever the incident is that you're running from, the key is to be lightweight and fast while still being able to provide for all of your immediate needs: maintaining your core body temperature, consuming water to stay hydrated, and consuming calories for energy...and to be able to cover ground quickly without wearing yourself out. In addition, you need to be able to take care of any life-threatening injuries that you may have sustained during the incident, or since you've left the incident. and you need to be able to effectively and efficiently navigate from point A to point B. With this in mind, it's important that you really streamline your kit and only carry what's absolutely necessary, as well as allowing for some redundancy for some of the more important things, to allow for contingencies that you didn't see coming. While it may be tempting to carry as many modern conveniences as you possibly can to make your life easier, the simple fact is that the heavier this pack is the slower you're going to move, the more water you're going to need to consume to stay hydrated, and the more calories you're going to burn and therefore more calories you need to consume to keep your energy levels up. All three of those things go against your main goal which is to put distance between you and whatever the incident is as quickly as possible. You should never plan on carrying a bag that is is more than 20% of your actual body weight. A better goal would be to have a bag that's 10% of your body weight, and it'll make you that much faster, that much more efficient, so long as you're still able to provide for all your basic needs. My bag weighs in at only 18 pounds, that's a little less than 9% of my total body weight. This allows me to move extremely fast and cover longer distances without getting tired and still provides for all of my needs. The bag starts with a good durable backpack, and like my clothing choices I prefer natural colors that blend well in a woodland environment, but I don't want a true camouflage pattern that's gonna stick out in an urban environment. I also try to avoid clothing and equipment that has too much of a tactical look to it. This is another thing that allows me to be a little more inconspicuous regardless of where I find myself. I may plan on bugging out to the wilderness but I may have to start my bug-out from an urban location, I may have to go through an urban location, or I may have to come back into an urban location to resupply at some point, so I don't want anything that makes me stick out. Let's take a look inside: now as far as my immediate needs I need to maintain my core body temperature and especially within the first you 24 hours or so in the beginning of a bug-out scenario, when I'm not sure you know whether it's going to be a permissive or a non-permissive environment, I'm going to be extremely careful, so fire is not going to be something that I'm going to do if I don't have to, so the primary function of my body's thermoregulation, maintaining my body's core temperature, falls on my shelter kit. Every good shelter kit consists of something to sleep under, something to sleep on, something to sleep in, and some cordage to hold it all together. For something to sleep under I prefer a military poncho, it takes the place of both a rain jacket and a tarp so it's multifunctional and when I'm moving I could use this in place of a rain jacket. It's large enough to protect me from the rain and also drape over the back of my equipment and keep my equipment dry. It also has these grommets that I can use to tie up simple and effective poncho shelters when I'm stationary; and as far as this being camouflaged, I don't necessarily mind my shelter system being camouflaged because most of the time this is going to be packed up in my bag and not seen. One of the benefits of having this camouflage pattern is that when I when I do stop and I do put up a shelter, this camouflage pattern offers me a little bit of concealement. When it comes to something to sleep in, it's hard to beat a military poncho liner for something that's lightweight and extremely packable. It also saves me time when I go to pack up because I don't have to worry about a stuff sack or any cinch straps or anything. It can be crammed into all the voids in your pack rather quickly. The majority of our body heat is lost to conduction from our bodies being in direct contact with the ground. In my opinion, thermal mattresses are a little too bulky and they catch on too many things. They stick out from the sides of your pack a lot of times, they catch on a lot of things in the woods, and for that reason I like to carry a simple bivy sack. This bivy sack can be stuffed with leaves and debris to make what's called a browse bed mattress to sleep on and it's also waterproof and windproof so if I don't feel like putting up a poncho shelter I can tuck myself inside here with my poncho liner and use this as a standalone shelter and be fairly protected from the elements as far as cordage goes I prefer TITAN SurvivorCord for a number of reasons this is high-quality true milspec paracord that has the outer sheath and it has the seven inner strands it has three additional strands one is a copper utility wire one is a monofilament fishing line the other is a waxed jute strand that I can fluff up and use for emergency tinder this prevents me from having to carry an extra spool of wire for use in trapping and it also prevents me from carrying an additional spool of fishing line for food procurement on top of giving me an additional emergency tinder source for fire-starting true milspec paracord has a breaking strength of 550 pounds in this Titan survivor cord which is true milspec plus three strands has a breaking strength of 660 pounds so it's going to hold whatever I need it to hold lastly I carry six lightweight aluminum tent stakes this is something that's more of a convenience when I do finally settle in for the night to throw up a shelter I want it to go up as quickly as possible although I can make these in the field this is one more thing that consumes time and energy that I can eliminate without adding much weight to my pack in most cases I'm trying not to be found one of the quickest ways I can signal my location is to have a roaring fire the flames and a smoke can be seen day or night and it can be smelled from a long way off it's not something I would I will likely need in the beginning and not something I want unless I absolutely have to so I've built the rest of my kit to ensure it isn't an immediate need however I may need it for thermal regulation I may need it to boil water may need it to cook food etc so I need to be able to make it as quickly as possible in all types of weather fire is an extremely critical skill over all so it deserves some redundancy a lighter is the easiest method since it's sure flame and keep in mind that it's not the same thing as sure fire I'll normally keep the lighter in my pocket so if I'm separated from my pack for some reason whether that's voluntarily or involuntarily I still have a chance of having an ignition source the main problems with the lighter are that they're pretty challenging to use in the wind in the rain and that's likely when you're going to need it the most the other problem is the fuel can leak out if the button is being depressed in your bag or if it's in your pocket or in your kit and if they get wet you have to dry them out before using them also they've got a lot of small moving parts that can break so I normally carry my lighter in an Exotac fireSLEEVE to prevent all of this. in an effort to conserve what little resources I have I like to have a couple more durable and longer lasting redundancies for those I choose a fresnel lens and a ferrocerium rod if the Sun is out I can quickly start a fire with little effort using solar techniques that take nothing away from my kit if that's not possible I'll normally choose to use the ferrocerium rod a Ferro rod is a larger version of the same sparking device that's found within a lighter I can expect this particular one and a half by six inch Ferro rod to start thousands upon thousands of fires and last several years before wearing out while these lighter may only provide hundreds of fires and a year or so and that's something that's important to consider when you may not be able to resupply I can normally source dry natural tender in any weather condition to use for starting a fire but it's worth carrying some man-made emergency tinder to use for when dry material is scarce and we're not convenient to go look for I like these fire tabs ten of them take up very little space and weigh next to nothing I can pull each tab apart to make three fires each they also work really well with a lighter that's out of fuel and work great with the larger Ferro rod as well on top of emergency tinder I generally like to carry at least three beeswax candles these are UCO candles and in addition to being a good useful tool for getting a fire going especially in wet weather I can also use this as kind of a low-key source of light around my campfire that doesn't put off as much light less likely to give me away in the event I'm using this and if I had to I could boil water with this it would just take a little while but each one of these candles burns for 12 hours so I've got 36 hours of light in every three pack the next challenge in a bug-out scenario will be remaining hydrated normally a person needs one half gallon about 64 ounces per day the need is much greater when the weather is hot if the area you're working in is especially dry or if there's a lot of physical exertion happening like you will be when you're carrying a pack great distances across difficult terrain under stress and possibly injured water is heavy it weighs about eight pounds per gallon we've already discussed that carrying extra weight will require more water consumption so for me I would rather rely on resupplying at every opportunity then attempt to carry a full day or a few days worth of water which could be several gallons I should also mention that I'm not anywhere near the desert I don't plan on going anywhere near the desert so if you are you want to make you may want to carry more containers of water from the start for a container I prefer a single walled stainless steel 32 ounce water bottle single walled so that I can boil water in it to disinfect if needed 32 ounces for a couple of reasons one that's half of my normal daily water requirement and it's roughly one liter which is what my water purification tablets are meant for the nesting cup allows me to have a secondary container and also allows me to char material for fire if needed again if you're in a desert or extremely hot or dry weather environment or freshwater sources or a little bit fewer and farther between in your area than they are for where I'm planning on being I would highly recommend carrying at least two containers of water instead of just one an additional 32 ounces would only add two pounds to your total pack weight a cotton shemagh is useful for a number of reasons but it's part of my water kit to act as a pre-filter for my water bottle to keep debris out when I'm filling it I can also wet it and wrap it around the bottle and take advantage of evaporative cooling if the water's too hot to drink this would also keep your water and your self cool in a hotter environment should you need to because I don't want to start a fire unless I have to I carry a small lightweight water filter I prefer the Sawyer Mini it filters down to a 0.1 micron level and it's rated for a hundred thousand gallons if i were to drink two gallons a day which is way above my requirement i could expect this filter to last me almost 137 years I can use it in several different ways as well which we'll get into later it also comes with you know a couple of other accessories one of which being a large syringe that you can use to flush this periodically that doubles as an irrigation syringe for wounds so this is also part of my first-aid kit I also carry twenty water purification tabs while my primary means would be to use the water filter and when possible to boil to save resources there could be situations where I could drop one of these tablets in 32 ounces of contaminated water and let them do the work for me while I continue to move an example that comes to mind is crossing stream during movement that I don't have time for this situation doesn't allow me to stop to actually take the time to filter it I get it fill the bottle as I cross and keep on moving these tablets alone will give me about 10 days of my normal water requirement food is not necessarily an immediate need however it is a metabolic need and you're going to be burning calories and an extremely high rate you can't afford to completely let yourself tank mentally or physically and you likely don't have time to trap fish or hunt right away I carry emergency rations in my bag to make sure I have some calories to bring in that I don't have to work for my goal is to create distance as quickly as possible and that requires energy I prefer the SOS emergency rations because they're individually wrapped once you open the main pack and they taste pretty good each pack has nine individually wrapped bars that are about four hundred calories each for a total of 3600 calories so this is 3600 calories that I don't have to work for that don't take any time I can eat these on the move and never stop once those run out and as opportunities present themselves I want to be equipped with at least some basic supplies to procure food that don't add much weight and take up very little space we had already talked about the monofilament fishing line and the utility wire that are found in the survivor cord I also carry a ReadyMan Wilderness Survival Card and this has hooks arrows points an improvised fish frog spear point and some snare locks as well as a couple of little tools so this coupled with the monofilament fishing line and the utility wire that I can double over and use a snare wire inside the survivor cord gives me a nice little kit to be able to fish or trap when the opportunity presents itself it would no doubt be a highly dangerous event that pushes you to bug out and well not all would involve gunfire or sharp metal or explosions or what have you there are some that we can all like limp think of that might if you become injured at the start of an incident or somewhere along the way you need to be able to take care of it to the best of your ability I'd like to carry a kit that can handle injuries sustained from things like gunshot wounds or lacerations to the extremity torso or head I like the Black Scout Survival Individual First Aid Kit, the BSS IFAK as the baseline and then I add a couple of things to that based on my experience in my competency level this allows me to take care of major bleeding sucking chest wounds tension pneumothorax manage airways what have you any sort of trauma and that could be either for myself or the people that are with me and of course I like to keep that somewhere where I can get to it quickly you need to have the ability to navigate from where you are to where you're going as efficiently as possible you've got very limited resources at your disposal so you need to make time quickly hopefully you're moving towards a well-stocked much safer location having said that you may not be able to take the route you originally planned on taking and you need to be able to adjust on the fly based on circumstances I'd like to have a map of the entire area I expect to be going through along with some waterproof paper and some mechanical pencils for recording information and route planning as far as compasses I prefer the Suunto MC2 compass because it's got a sighting mirror that I can also use for signaling and it also has a small magnifying lens that I can use as a backup fire-starting method it also has built-in scales that I can use in place of a protractor or a coordinate scale I also keep pace beads so that I can easily keep track of distances traveled this is extremely important in the event I have to change routes on the fly knowing what distance I had moved for the last known point before changing direction allows me to better pinpoint where I might but there are a few tools that I feel are absolutely essential for every bug-out bag so the first one being a headlamp with extra batteries the second being a good full tang fixed blade belt knife and the third being a multi-tool I prefer the headlamps that you can put a physical filter on like a red lens filter over a light that has it as a button option if I'm trying to sneak in as concealed as possible without compromising my position the last thing I want to do is hit the wrong button and flash a white light instead I also carry three or four sets of extra batteries which should be more than enough to get me where I'm going especially if I'm trying not to use light at all when I'm traveling or when I'm working around camp at night and I prefer the longer-lasting lithium style batteries for this option in my opinion and experience the best fixed blade knife for the money is the Mora Carbon Garberg it's full tang maintains a good sharp edge has a good 90-degree spine has a Scandi grind that's easy to sharpen in the field and this thing can take a beating, this thing will do everything you needed to do in the field and then some and lastly my choice for the multi-tool would be a Leatherman as far as the model I'm just looking for one that has pliers wire cutters has an awl for stitching and repair has a good saw on it and in addition to all that I want it to have a good blade so that I have a back of course depending on your situation and your experience level and what you've planned for you may want to add certain tactical gear and personal security items as needed it's going to increase the overall weight of your pack and slow you down but but it's also going to greatly enhance your security in an uncertain situation but that's a conversation for another day this particular go bag has been developed to take care of all of your immediate needs and at only 18 pounds it won't weigh you down until next time stay safe keep prepping", "j6zQgrzqOLc": "", "rIlwHT4IdRc": "hi guys thanks for tuning in to another video on Forgotten weapons comm I'm Ian and I am here with a pretty cool gun that has been provided for this video by modern arms out of Tempe Arizona suburb of Phoenix this is a GE m134 minigun and i'm sure everyone's familiar with having seen these but i bet a lot of people don't really know how they work or where they came from so a little bit of background on this thing these were actually first developed as a 20 millimeter rotary aircraft armament and the reason that they are called mini guns today is because when ge developed this one they scaled it down from a 20 millimeter aircraft cartridge to this little tiny 308 round and at that point it becomes the mini version of the gun now actually development goes back a little bit before that that was 1950s but in fact experiments with electrically powered Gatling guns and that's what this really is go all the way back to the 1890s you can in fact find it's really cool you can find articles from magazines in the 1890s talking about Gatling guns with electrical power firing at these astonishing rates of fire like 3,000 rounds a minute literally as fast as they fire today they were able to do prior to 1900 the reason is an electrically driven motor will run this gun as fast as you want to run the motor now the obstacle back in the you know 1900 was you couldn't just have electricity anywhere and where these guns were considered or powered Gatling guns were considered at that time period was his naval defense because on a large naval vessel you had a turbine always running that was providing electrical power and so you could hook the gun up to that at that point you didn't have vehicles driving around that you could put power you know connect the power from and certainly you can't run this as an infantry weapon because you need electricity and in 1900 you don't have electricity to just kind of carry around like that so they never they were never really successful at that point people opted for other other mechanisms and at that point they were never belt-fed they were typically running Ackles drums or Broadwell drums or some other existing Gatling feed mechanism and at 3,000 rounds a minute any of those go dry really fast if you're gonna run this effectively you really need a belt feed that's what we have in this and that's what made these practical in the 1950s so power wise these things run on 24 volts DC and they run now your power consumption depends on your rate of fire because this is a totally electrically operated gun it's not recoil operated it's not gas operated it's operated by an electric motor so it'll run it whatever rate of fire you want it to and your power consumption for three to four thousand rounds a minute is gonna be about a kilowatt in half and that's quite a lot of power you're not getting that with double A's or cr123 batteries you need basically a pair of car batteries hook together and that's on one of several reasons why whenever you see these things in Hollywood being carried around and fired from the hip or whatever completely bogus the first reason it's bogus is because you're the guys not carrying you know 100 pounds of batteries with him the second reason it's bogus is he's not carrying the ammunition with him because at 3,000 rounds a minute you're firing 67 rounds per second  you're go through a lot of ammo and that you need somewhere to store it and it weighs a lot and of course the recoil force you're talking literally hundreds of pound feet of recoil impulse from this thing this is equivalent to fire your 308 rifle 3,000 times in a minute or 67 times in the second adding all that recoil up and delivering it to the shooter so that's why they're always on fixed mounts now originally these were aircraft armaments specifically helicopter armaments in Vietnam and they were fantastic in that role that's where they really shine because in say an you know an attack Huey you can stick this thing on a nice fixed mount guys got a nice open field fire out the door ammo just goes in a couple of crates inside the helicopter you can plug into the helicopters turbine engine get all the power you need and the real advantage of this the reason that you want 3,000 rounds a minute is because when you're flying past someone you have a very limited window in order to engage a target and so what you had to do you know the better the gun was the more bled it could deliver to the target in that one second or two seconds that were available this is something that you'll also see in standard aircraft machine guns for example a ground mount browning 1919 run said five or six hundred rounds a minute the aircraft version they make a bunch of changes and crank that up to like 1,200 rounds a minute because again you have these very short engagement windows and when you are on target you need to put as much lead downrange during that brief moment as you can that's where this shines all right so the way that these actually work is there we have a couple main components here we have a barrel cluster we have the actual power source the the motor that runs the gun and then the most complex and really in some ways the most important element to the gun is this structure here which is the DES linker so this gun is fed via a standard belt of 308 ammunition normal links m60 links and what you have to do is have a way to take the rounds off the belt and then feed them into the rotary system of the Gatling gun so I've taken a cover plate off here so we can see the actual workings of the gun and what we have are six barrels and six bolts and you can see depress this you can see that the the barrels rotate through and we're kind of getting the boring section here but right here is where they're closing with a new cartridge they're firing right about here and then the bolt get scammed backwards by this track to extract the cartridge so we're getting a feed down in this area comes up chambers locks fires at 10:00 or 11:00 o'clock on the clock face and then extracts and ejects and you can actually hear the firing pin  so the firing mechanism the actual barrel cluster is in some ways it's not that complex and it's actually extremely similar to a vintage 1870s Gatling gun what makes it different is the DES linker alright so this is a separate D linking mechanism and this is definitely the most complex part of the actual gun so what we have going on here is right here is the entryway where the belts coming in so when this is on the gun it's gonna be kind of in this orientation with this solenoid sticking up out of the top but what we're looking at here is our links are gonna come in here our belts going to come in here and what we have to do is actually push the cartridges forward off of the links or straight through the links so most machine guns pull the cartridge out the back this is going to push it straight through straight forward through the link and it's going to be hooked up to the motor by this gear and we can see it best okay so right up in there at the top of travel you can just see the pushers starting to come through as I rotate this what's gonna happen is rounds coming here at the top of this mechanism they start to get pushed out of the links and then we come to this side they get pushed forward into this silver spindle and what's interesting here is this spindle actually holds two cartridges one above the other when it's operating so when a cartridge is first stripped off the belt it goes into the very bottom of this cutout and it's then going to go all the way around this circle and end up on top of this it's kind of like a snail shape surface here so when the cartridge goes down it's on the underside when it comes up it's writing on top of this surface and right about here it gets transitioned off into the gun so the best way for me to demonstrate this is to actually just put some ammo in it so there is no firing pin mechanism in it or anything in this this is just the D linker and it would be a little bit better if I had these on links but I can manually cycle it with my thumb if they're just loose rounds and you'll get the idea of how this works so I put a couple rounds in there and then I have the exposed gear so we can start to pull them down a couple more in there fill it back up now if we look down here we're gonna start to see these come through so there's our first projectile coming through and as I said it's going to come up inside here so these cartridges are in the bottom of this boy I don't know all the terminology for this gun bottom of that spindle and then they're going to rotate around there we go no now you can see we have this cartridge on the top and we've got another one coming in right below it right there just in time this one comes up now it can actually come out it's sitting on top of this surface and in the top of the spindle and right in here the D linker hands this cartridge off to the actual barrel cluster to fire  and that is how your minigun feeder or D linker works when those links when the rounds are pushed out of the links the links are gonna come out this little feed chute kind of directed away from the rest of the the works of the gun to keep it clean but that's where the links will come out and we'll see that in just a moment in some firing footage so the trigger mechanism here being that this is an electrically fired gun it's got an electric trigger mechanism make sense right a bunch of different stuff going on we have this plug which connects to our master power and then a safety switch that turns power on or off to the gun and of course when you knock this down you're going to turn the gun off light just confirms that you have power running to the gun these are your triggers you can fire the gun with either one of them you don't have to have both depressed and then interestingly you have another one here this button is actually set up to connect to your communications so if you're the door gunner in a helicopter or if you're you know Humvee or something that has this mounted on it pushing this activates your radio it's the equivalent of reaching to your microphone and what this allows you to do is keep both hands on the gun and still be able to communicate which is important when you're the one directing this kind of firepower all right so firing procedure lifts up the safety engage master power lights on although you can't see it in the sunlight and now we're ready to go one of the interesting side effects of an electrically powered gun like this is the barrels don't just stop the moment you release the trigger they're going to the motor stops and then the barrels spin down until they stop from friction you do want to make sure that you don't have say all of your ammo continue to feed through the gun while the barrels spinning right so you don't have you know fifty or hundred rounds dump out the side of the gun while the barrels are slowing down and that is done in one of two ways the original mechanism was actually a mechanical a solenoid on on the feeder and with those you would actually lose about 5 loaded rounds when you stop firing they would spit out the ejection port and the reason for that was that they were in the gun cluster at the time the more modern way which companies like Dylan have have developed is to actually put a clutch on the thing that disconnects the feeder earlier and with a Dylan clutch on it you don't lose any live ammo that was one of their selling points so you know I can fire up like a one-second burst and I'm getting about a one-second spin down a little more than a one-second spin down when you're actually shooting these something to keep in mind is that they don't really like quick repeat taps of the trigger so give it a moment to spin down before you fire it again otherwise you're kind of inviting feed jams when these guns do jam it's primarily this guy it's the the D linker that's going to give you problems and you don't want to have to pull this thing apart to clear a malfunction you just want to keep shooting it so in general firing these give it a burr you doesn't have to be a long burst but don't try and fire stop and then immediately fire again all right before we can shoot it we have to load it up now of course we have this feed chute that doesn't what this does is simply guide the belt and prevent where there's a cloth cover on here to prevent links from getting stuck in the belt this just keeps everything nice and clean so I'm gonna go ahead and disconnect that then this is our ammo can and this is I believe a thousand round ammo cam got some half-turn locks and we can take the lid off and you've got it divided into two segments here and there's a trick to getting the thousand round continuous belt all loaded in here just perfectly so it'll feed without any snags now we're gonna load I believe I think we're into a 200 round belt this time so we're not really gonna need to mess with this we can use just the cover so let me put this back on what I'm gonna do here is pop the top of this and what this this funnel is here so that you can feed from either this side or this side and the belt will slide into the center position where it goes up into the feed chute we've got a plastic nice low friction roller there so put our feed chute on there we go lift up the top cover as with US military machine guns we want the brass facing down or as they say brass to the graphs what's kind of cool about this is because these are contained in the feed chute I can actually push this belt and it'll push rounds all the way up that shoot up to the gun all right I can see the end of the feed chute or the end of the belt up in the chute there so I have just a little bit of belt left which has gotten bent I had it twisted down there and bent a link so it is important on a minigun that you do not have a trailing link like this because that will mess up the that will jam up the D linker so I'm gonna put a loose round in that trailing link and then we'll just slide there because I have so little belt down in the can I don't need to worry about making sure that it's folded right it just barely even hits the bottom of the cam so go ahead and close this lock it down now we're ready for the next step of loading rotate the barrel till the clutch will open up all the way okay now by pinning this in place it will allow me to rotate the barrels which I have to do to manually feed the belt in at first so I've got my belt down here we're gonna lift it up we want to make sure that everything goes in perfectly straight and parallel here you don't want the rounds nose-diving forward or back and so we've got it all the way up I'm gonna maintain some upward pressure rotate the barrel cluster counterclockwise which will rotate the d-link or clockwise and pull that first round up until I hear a click there's one click we want to clicks so maintain pressure make sure these are still nice and even  there's our second click now the D linker is holding the belt under its own strength I can let go with the belt I'll go ahead and put this back in place and now I want to continue to click the barrel cluster through until I see a first the first link come out of the feed chute there now we're going to continue to click this through until the first link comes out the feed chute once that happens we'll know that the belt is all the way through the D linking process okay there we go very important now we remove the pin and reengage the clutch if I don't do this ammo will continue up into the barrel cluster and after a couple of clicks it will actually fire around as long as the clutch is engaged here now the barrel stays still and what we'll be doing here is just cycling the belt up and in until the gun is completely ready to fire and now you saw the second link came out now we're all the way through the D linking cycle and I can click the barrel around as much as I want because the clutch is engaged ammo is not feeding into the gun at this point however the gun is hot and as soon as you turn on power and press the triggers the clutch when you press the trigger the clutch disengages and allows the gun to actually fire alright here we go master power on that was a little high  and that's a hundred rounds so there isn't an iron there isn't an optic on this gun and you actually you aim it by watching impact and the trickiest part about that is it fires so fast that you run out of ammo you have to be pretty fast to pick up okay where where am i hitting adjust with a regular machine gun 500 rounds a minute it's not that hard to go well okay you know duck duck and bring it on to target with this thing by that time you fired at 250 round belt already it's gone so you have to get some pretty quick reaction times on this which means that I need some more practice on it I normally don't shoot at goofy targets like old trucks but the minigun is kind of a different beast and kind of requires something like that so I'm gonna see if I can actually hit that  we're gonna start low bring the GUP gun up on to target powers on  well I was hitting it there shall we go take a look and see what happened so as a guy without a whole lot of experience shooting a minigun I was able to successfully perforate the snot out of this truck including both of the tires and I think there is going to be an attempt to set this thing on fire which will be made very easy by the fact that the gas tank is now also thoroughly perforated and drizzling out on the ground so I'm gonna stay a little farther back from it than this it is interesting to note that that rate of fire actually makes it kind of hard to shoot because you have so little time to to track your target and engage before you're just out of ammo so we can't take some actual a little bit of real-world lesson from a goofy exercise like this namely you'll notice that I have bullet holes pretty well distributed across the front of the truck including a bunch here on the front blew out that tire however if we look at the back side of the truck we've got a lot of bullet holes coming out the back but we don't really have any coming out the front here got to there in front of the tire and one clearly went low enough to actually puncture the tire but while I wouldn't say there is any safe way to hide behind this from a minigun you'll die a little bit later if you hide behind the engine block  thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video I'd like to really thank modern arms out of Tempe Arizona for letting me get my grubby hands on this thing show you guys how it works and show you guys what it looks like actually shooting tune it again to forgotten weapons calm and have some fun  you", "e7RlN6j9s7Q": "two more seconds than he would have stabbed him right in his neck or in his back or his arm or whatever he was stabbed him bottom line President Trump were calling on you to do this this is clear-cut evidence of them what's up everybody it's branded with that's the point back with another episode what I'm doing today is a special exclusive firsthand breakdown of the attempted stabbing by aunty phone - a Marine - a US military veteran so I want to break this down exactly from a first-hand account I was there we had this awesome video by son of Hightower who's an independent media in Portland this is on his channel so shout out to him for taking this 360 footage because this really gives me a great breakdown of what's going to happen and what took place so people can get the full concept of what really went down so right as we start this video as you see on the screen you see this whole group right here right you see aunt Aoife all right here so let's go ahead and [Music]  [Music]  so right here what they're doing is illegally blocking this road okay this road is supposed to be open for cars to drive through this innocent young female that was in this car in this black car right here had no idea that these roads were being cut off because they weren't supposed to be so there was no police directing traffic none of that she was just driving and she ran into this mom I just what happened to be in the middle of this mob so let's see right here you could tell in the background I'm circling right here is the military veteran whose name is Greg he's a Marine thank you for your service did not know this at the time found out after so I'm glad I was just able to be there for somebody who was innocent and was being attacked so I'm going to unpause now  [Music]  dogs and we're gonna go see here he's doing nothing he's sitting here not moving a muscle okay it's not moving a muscle they trying to make enforce this girl to drive backwards so I eventually make my way up  so this time let's let's back up a little bit let's see what happens right here see this brown jacket see them see the marine right here  [Music]  this guy is a fascist Abel this guy's a fascist Abel so immediately they're starting to point this guy out apparently he's pretty well-known in pretty well-known patriot out in Portland obviously he's you know he's a veteran he's a Marine so naturally auntie felucca and they're all pointing at him as if he's the problem when they're the ones that impeded that impeded the block like they own it or something like you know like they had the right to stop this you go from going through traffic that's illegal so let's continue to watch so they're all pointing at him right now and he's not moving I'm also not saying a word  [Music]  one  [Music] so that bottle was just thrown  as you see right here I'm right here by the window of the driver's side of the car I'm telling her to calm down relax we'll get you out of here safe and at this point I start telling this group right here to split up break off let her get through let her get through  [Music]  so what is he doing this whole time he's sitting here doing absolutely nothing hasn't moved a muscle right he's not causing trouble not bothering anybody so at this point Portland PD on the bikes come they split traffic now mind you boom look at all this antifa that are around these people are important to pay attention to this is how they're moving so he starts circling around look it back look at a little Samuel Aseel back here and Shamu right here okay we got potbelly right here okay soon as the car moves and there's a clear path where people are supposed to be able to slide through right he gets on his bike and he goes to lead right here we have antifa stepping right into his path blocking him we got this guy was trying to be like an innocent bystander but really he's a he's a setup too so he goes in and he hits the back of his bike with this pedal and gets it stuck in there as this guy is impeding him  boom right there right so now with that being done we have this guy moving in a little drummer boy right here we got a Teletubby body right here we got my mama's a vegan and Fifi only salads guy right here right let's continue to go on pausing so right there I've been down and pull the thing out of the spokes so you can get up out of there now watch Puma right here let's watch and see boom all right here watch him okay saw that kicked his bike now watch Teletubby tell us how he wants to get in on the action kicks his bike little drummer boy right here tries to put his his mama's bucket his mom uses his bucket to watch cars okay and he's disrespecting them by spray painting it and you know using it to attack people with so he makes it through right good now remember might remember uh remember Teletubby body I'm gonna Teletubby watch Teletubby right here [Music] puts his arm out sprays right in his face look at that hiding behind a group put his hand through sprays the dude in the face okay well what the hell is wrong with these people man think off of this footage right so he gets sprayed in the face okay so right here so this is where it gets interesting around the 1:40 mark on this video is when the attempted stabbing taken goes to take place and thank God you know I was there and thank God I had recognized it immediately and deterred and thank God not that they didn't turn around and stab me but at that point I wasn't even thing about that just making sure the heating his stabbed in his neck from the back that was the whole you know that's the whole thing so that was important that was my whole mindset naturally that I mean that's what it should be I guess so let's go ahead and watch this because I'm gonna play it normal speed so I'm gonna see how if you can catch it and then I'm gonna bring it back and and break it down on at point two five speed  you saw that ball thrown pay attention pay attention to the right side your screen right here hoodie right here  see that enhance see that see how faster once boom breaks it put them in his pocket now let's stop we're gonna back up  laughing the yelling screaming recording none of these people care if he's safe or not they just want to get that footage ridiculous man it's ridiculous so here I am here I go home and he gets the rap you get sprayed in the face so [Music] we're gonna stop right here we're gonna go to the settings we're gonna go to playback speed and create a 25 okay so I want you to pay attention right here okay I am right here I'm trying to push my way through the crowd [Music] now let's stop you see this you see this right here in his hand what is that you tell me continue to go what is that what is that that's a stencil knife that's a shank okay he's about to walk up and stab him from the back ah let's play a trick now let's play [Music]  only only through the power god man was was you know I didn't just get stabbed right there or do just like snap to sit don't touch me and stab me right there you know thank God it didn't happen so but that's the that's the reality of the situation that these in chief of people are they should be classified as a terrorist a domestic terrorist organization president Trump were calling on you to do this this is clear-cut evidence of them being a terrorist organization that's it now look back here let's let's go ahead and look at the crowd right well all this is going down boom so we're gonna go back one more time on this all right we're gonna pause we're gonna go back and we're gonna we're gonna watch as he pulls out see right here look at this  okay right there seen you right there I mean that's clear-cut to me that's clear-cut to me what the hell are you thinking this is the United States of America you're gonna stab somebody who served our country get from the back with your mask on like a coward you're cowards president Trump they're cowards and they need to be classified as terrorists immediately immediately based off of this footage alone immediately now we're gonna bring her back one more time and I'm gonna play it at full speed at normal speed see how fast that could have happened okay how fast he could have just walked up and stabbed him right in the neck  [Music]  so at this point you tell them put it you know you know get away don't touch him don't do anything you know just whatever I could say at that moment to get him away trying to protect this man at all call  remember Sammy the seal body the chick that I point out in the beginning well here she is all right they came all the way out of the way to go do this  hands only no block right there I was the first time she tried  [Music] boom tempted to take your hat now let's go back and I'll watch this go back here nowhere to be found there back there right stops you see how mad he got right there cuz one letting them get to him before letting gets alone thank God for this man right here I didn't know who he was I still don't know who you are but I appreciate you having uh having our back out there having my back out there one percent Patriot thank you now look at how they're moving right trying to still surround so let's continue at this point right here I get in front of him and I'm just letting him know hey I got you don't worry about it right so let's continue to watch his back dogs I want you guys to watch this well they're still trailing  right here boom see Puma trying to slide up to the front again and I cut them off right here I seen them right here now check right behind the green shirt this female goes and throws a rock or some projectile at him and I thank God I missed them and she tried to do it again and so I ran in front of her this man takes her down just to stop them from trailing the injured this man now watch back here we got a camo jacket orange bandana not sure if you guys seen the footage but he was arrested later on for something else I'm not sure exactly what it was but he was arrested but this guy captured the most beautiful spartan kick right to the chest full speed don't run full speed at people trying to attack them not a good idea okay so let's let's watch see I'm running full speed let's turn this way and watch oh don't do it don't run up on us like that don't try to attack don't try to attack that's what happens  [Music] back here and we're gonna go to the one the 140 mark okay pause right there so this is at the 140 mark we're gonna rewind actually five seconds we're going to go to 135 mark and once again I want you to play pay attention  right there two more seconds and he would have stabbed them right in his neck or in his back or his arm or wherever he would have stabbed him bottom line this should not be allowed this should be clear-cut evidence that these people are direct threat to society and they need to be D masked they need to be disbanded and they need to be arrested on sight just thank God that nothing happened this is a breakdown of that 360 cam thank you guys for staying tuned staying tuned in like share subscribe please share this video because this is how we get the truth out the mainstream media will not show you this so why I'm here independent media to do this for you so that you can understand the severity of what's going on in these streets and not what they're trying to tell you behind your television screen okay so pay attention guys this is the real truth this is the real deal and that's the point  you", "mpiPWHzOn2U": "hello and welcome to farm freedom this is going to be another episode of gun floor questions in today's episode we're gonna talk about what not to do as a customer in a gun store so before all you guys start hating on other things that employees should not do behind a gun counter don't worry I will be making another video in the series coming up soon on what gun floor associates should not do at a gun floor so as you guys know if you've been following my channel at all I do work behind a gun counter so that is my only job that I have currently along with being a full-time student and I've been in the firearm industry now for about two years actually working in the industry itself so I have seen a lot I've worked at a couple of different gun stores let's start our list off with the number one thing you should not do as a customer in a gun store unholster your current concealed carry weapon because you want the employee to take a look at it or see if you could sell it or get worked on or anything like that so don't be that guy who says hey can you take a look at this you know real quick and pull out the gun I'm wearing sweat pants right now so the holster comes right out with it but you get the point don't don't reach around pull your gun out main reason it's kind of a no-brainer to me but I guess not to a lot of customers we don't know if that kind of chambered if it's loaded not loaded and honestly not to kind of judge that person but I don't know your skill level I don't know if you just got that gun yesterday and you have no idea how to operate it and all of a sudden I get shot for some stupid reason but on top of that you have to realize that you're in a gun store and maybe not in a less free State but in a state like Pennsylvania I would say that probably 80% of the customers and the employees more like 99% of the employees are currently carrying themselves so I don't know and a lot of customers don't know around them that you know they can't hear the conversation if all of a sudden I'm I'm being held up and it's some sort of a robbery it's really just not a good idea at all to unholster your weapon the best thing that you can do is simply go out to your vehicle unload the weapon bring it back in in a box or if you don't have a box that's fine but check it in up at the front counter generally at any gun store you go to they'll want you to check it in somewhere before you bring it to the gun Connor but if all else fails guys just ask what to do before you just go ahead and pull it out so that's that's the number one thing you should not do and I can't tell you how many times that's happened to me the second thing on our list is going to be I'll point the muzzle of the gun towards me it's just it's a really really frustrating thing on the gun counter that I see way way too much and that's gonna simply be obviously you're gonna look at the gun you know you don't know you you've never really looked at gun before the first thing you do is finger on the trigger point the gun directly at my face and this is a really frustrating thing guys and I think it's really more just misinformation a lot of people just think oh you know they checked it obviously it's unloaded it shouldn't matter but again guys that just shows us that you have no idea about the fundamental safety rules of firearms and and the fact that you take any sort of a firearm and plant at somebody's face really really disconcerning and it makes me as a gun floor associate not really want to sell you a gun that you're just flashing me and everybody else in the store with the muzzle so that's that's a huge thing guys and if you're if you're going to get a firearm you're gonna look at it and take it out of the case just be courteous know the firearm rules before and that is just don't ever point a gun loaded or unloaded to anything you don't want to destroy that's one of the commandments so simply just either take it out of the case and point it at the floor or point it at the wall behind the gun store associate without you know getting anywhere near him you know if the gun floor associates here just simply point the gun over you know to the right a little bit or to the left a little bit not at anybody and that's gonna be the best way that you can do that the third thing here this is going to be don't interrupt a gun floor associate while he's talking to the customer that he's talking to this is a really big one guys this really kind of gets on my nerves and how a scenario that that you know has having multiple times as I'll be telling a customer about something I'll be showing them a gun telling them you know kind of opinions behind it what they should look at with what they shouldn't look at and all of a sudden you know some random customer will kind of butt into the conversation say oh no no no no you need this gun and it's generally something that's super opinionated and probably eight times out of ten a completely wrong statement and what tends to happen is the the customer will kind of look at them and be like oh okay and think you know think that that's right and it creates a really awkward situation because I have to tell them the the accurate information and this person just told them something completely wrong completely opinionated and and I have to wait till they kind of go away and say well you know that's not accurate and hope that they don't hear it and come back and start an argument it's just it's a really frustrating situation the only time ever that I would recommend doing this is if you're very very knowledgeable yourself and you go into a gun store and you hear wrong information getting put out by an employee and you know it's wrong information and then just simply kind of excuse yourself into the conversation J and just you know voice your opinion really nicely but honestly most the time guys unless you absolutely know it's wrong information don't don't put it into the conversation just don't do it so the fourth thing that we're gonna talk about is skipping in line this a lot of times isn't the customers fault sometimes I've worked at gun stores before where there's no really formal like like line like everybody just kind of walks up to the counter and you get served when you get served this system is awful and most the time people get jumped over in line all the time accidentally because they simply don't know if somebody was ahead of them but at the gun store that I work at now on many others out there we actually have a system that you just you put in your name and a tablet and it'll come up on a TV screen the exact you know list of people when you're next who's being served currently and it's an awesome system so whenever you go into a into a gun store look for something like that you know look for some sort of number system taking a number and if all else fails just kind of ask at some you know kind of low-key mom-and-pop gun shops they might not have anything but just simply asking where you first were you ahead of me and so on and just really be polite and courteous and again at the end of the day just don't cut in line know that if you're going to a gun store especially during the holidays we're getting closer to an election here it's gonna be busy guys so so be prepared to wait a pretty long time I mean they're at a busy gun store you could be waiting you know an hour to you know 45 minutes to an hour at the least so don't be the person you know that if it all else you know you're just you're waiting in line your numbers waiting to be called and just butt in line and say hey man you need to help me right now everybody waits just be courteous be polite and just just take a number and wait in line but the fifth thing we're gonna talk about is dry-firing so dry firing at a gun stores is kind of hit or miss here's what I'm gonna say and here's what I've seen at kind of every gun store it's perfectly generally fine the gun store is going to allow you to drive fire any sort of you know centerfire firearm at all whether that's a long gun handgun if it's a centerfire you're they're probably gonna be fine with you dry firing it practicing the trigger because this that's a huge selling point on a gun for the customer is gonna be how the trigger feels the only thing like at the gun store that I work at that we don't have your dry fire is rimfire and although most modern rimfire guns are probably fine to be dry fired once or twice it's just a little bit more of a gray area with rim Fire's if you should dry firearm earthy if you shouldn't so again what all else fails before you just start going and you know dry firing the gun just ask if it's alright if you dry fire it the sixth thing that we're going to talk about is going to be walk being away or turning around with the gun that you're looking at again this one was always a no-brainer to me before I started working in the industry but I guess it's not a lot of people so whenever you're looking at a gun you have to realize that most the guns are not going to have any sort of trigger safety on them at the moment it's just gonna be a live firearm and if you put a round in the chamber you very well could shoot the gun so this is something that we're all trained on behind the gun counter and something were really cautious over so it really becomes uncomfortable if somebody you know kind of turns around like this and you know they're looking at the gun because just simply I don't know if you're if you're putting around in the chamber or doing something weird with it or getting ready to you know run with the gun or so it's just it's a very stress inducing way to look at a firearm and also you know if you start walking away to go show your friends and you start doing anything like that behind the gun counter us as associates take that as kind of like a sketchy activity going on and we start trying to kind of keep tabs on that really quickly so just just stay face-to-face with a person try not to move around the counter the only time you know that you would move is if you're pointing the firearm on the floor but just don't turn around whenever we can't see although the chances are low that you're gonna be loading a loaded round in the chamber we don't know that and it becomes again a really sketchy situation the seventh thing that we're gonna talk about is asking us as associates to answer your legal advice so this is something that I think a lot of customers just simply don't know but us as gun associates although we may know a lot about firearms laws and legislation we cannot give out legal advice and this is kind of obvious again because if we were to give out legal advice you know and it was wrong or not factual Don you were to go out and a crime were to happen or something obviously that could lead back to us so we do not give out any legal advice how I kind of run it myself is if somebody asked me a question I'll give them as much as I and without you know actually giving legal advice but then I'll just simply refer them to a firearm specific attorney or refer them to you know a.gov website where they could find these laws and legislation to read over themselves but just just try not to ask too much I will say that a lot of the times I get asked hey I've done this crime you know in my past hey I've had a DUI will this count should I not get a gun can I not get a gun what's the deal we can't answer that guy's the best thing I can say is if you ever at all have any crime on your record before you even walk into a gun store make sure you contact a firearms attorney and a lot of the times it's something simple like that they'll literally just tell you right over the phone hey don't fill out the paperwork or do fill out the paperwork we can't at all answer anything so it's kind of a rough area there so just kind of you know be aware of that the final eight thing that we're going to talk about so that a thing on this list is going to be coming in to look at a gun for your significant other so a lot of people I don't think realize the issue today you know what we worry about the most in our gun stores is straw purchasing so we are trained to specifically ask questions and look for if we are concerned about a straw purchase you know what that looks like and to try to uncover one so a straw purchase is obviously to those of you who don't know is if you're buying a gun for somebody else so in the state of Pennsylvania my understanding of the law is that you can gift a firearm to your immediate relatives and that is your spouse or your son or daughter so that is going to be the only people that you can actually gift a firearm to so if I wanted to gift a handgun to say if I had a son I could gift that to him if if he was of age and he could own that that firearm specifically and there's not a problem with that anybody else you know girlfriend aunt uncle cousin grandma grandpa you can't do it it's a straw purchase so when you come in you know and you start asking questions saying hey want to buy a gun for my wife or or for my girlfriend or for my mom or whatever it already starts kind of ringing bells in our head on why are they not here getting the gun themselves so we very much understand that some your significant other might not want to come into the gun store that could be very afraid of guns or what-have-you but the best thing to do is to get your significant other to just come into the gun store with you it's a really sketchy situation whenever we're talking about you know not buying the gun for you specifically so the other thing on that is that to be honest with you buying a gun is like buying a pair of shoes if it doesn't fit you right you're not gonna like the gun so you really need to have that person into the gun store anyways so again just kind of bring that person in with you we can kind of help you out but but be prepared for almost every gun store associate to be very wary and skeptical and probably ask you some more kind of questions seeing the deal here because it can be a very odd situation and just know that they're honestly they're probably going to deny you the sale until that person comes back or they'll say hey we can put this on layaway or something until your significant other actually comes in and picks it up and that's just covering our end guys a lot of people don't know that if I were to fill out paperwork you know on a straw purchase and I didn't know you know there was a straw purchase and a crime was committed I would have to go to court and I could get in trouble so that's something that we really really trained on and trained and know about so these were my list of eight things on what not to do as a customer in a gun store I hope you guys enjoyed it I'll be putting out a new video here in a little bit on what guns store associates should not do in a gun store so I hope you guys enjoy that as well but thank you so much for watching and stay tuned for the next video to come", "Bntj6OCe2_g": "From the possible site of the legendary Garden of Eden to an island that may be covering an Alien Base -- Today we look at the 9 Most Mysterious Islands On Earth Number 9. \"Island of Socotra\" Off the coast of Somalia in the Indian ocean is an island that seems as though it belongs on another planet. Socotra Island has long been theorized as a location for the biblical Garden of Eden, and just by looking at pictures of it you can see why. The island is home to several species of plants that are can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found anywhere else on Earth. There are the Dr. Seuss looking Adenium socotranum which have big bulbous trunks and tiny gnarly branches that sprout from their tops and bear flowers that are a marvelous shade of pink. There odd appearance makes them kind of look like giant root vegetables. Then there are the Dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blood Trees which look like perfect natural umbrellas. The have trunks that resemble that of an average tree but their thick tightly bunched branches shoot upwards and form a mushroom like crown. Socotra is also home to three geographically unique species of bird: the socotra sunbird, socotra grosbeak and socotra starling. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many other creatures that inhabit the island other than that of bats and insects and the last time it was home to man was around the year 100 A.D. Adding to the mystery, the island has been the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the years. Number 8. \"Palmyra Atoll\" Though technically not an island but an atoll that formed from coral the mysterious nature of Palmyra Atoll cannot be ignored. Also known as Palmyra Island, the breathtakingly beautiful ringlet sits between American Samoa and Hawaii. Though it is full of lush vegetation and appears unblemished by man the island has long be the subject of superstition and folktales. There have been several cases of violent shipwrecks and mysterious disappearances of ships on and around the island. Those who have observed the island and survived to tell their tale have claimed having seen some extremely bizarre sights like that of floating lights, ghosts and sea monsters. It is also reported to be the home of an incredible amount of sharks who may have developed a distinct taste for humans. There is also the story of lost Incan treasure that may still be on the island. These tales and others which cannot be discussed do to their graphic nature have made Palmyra the stuff of legend amongst sailors and Pacific Islanders for centuries. Number 7. \"Vulcan Island\" Vulcan Island in the Philippines isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily an island that is shrouded in mystery but it definitely is a mindblowing locale. On the northern Philippine island of Luzon there sits a lake named Taal and in that lake there is an island called Taal Volcano, inside this island is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest crater lake and inside of this lake there sits yet another island, known as Vulcan Island. Not only is Vulcan Island one of the most fascinating of natural recursion it happens to be located on one of the most active volcanoes in the entire Pacific Ocean. Because of this fact it is incredibly dangerous to visit Vulcan Island as it has been quaking and bubbling since 1991. Number 6. \"Easter Island\" The world renowned Easter Island still attracts tourists, anthropologists and archaeologists to this day who are both perplexed and in awe of the statues left behind by the ancestors of the native Rapa Nui peoples. Though the mysteries behind these statues, called Moai are now mostly solved, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only puzzle that is confounded visitors to the small island off of Chile. Scientists recently answered one of the biggest questions surrounding the Moai which was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow did the Rapa Nui move these massive stone idols?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 They found out that these statues were specifically designed to have pot bellies so that they could be rocked back and forth until they were eventually wiggled to where they wanted them. But the mystery that still remains unsolved doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do with the Moai but rather the people that built them. The Rapa Nui have been found to have a completely separate genetic heritage to that of nearby native South American peoples. In fact their closest genetic relatives actually came from Pacific Islanders that live near Southeast Asia. So what is the mystery? Well despite being located in the Pacific, Easter Island is still thousands of miles away from the Rapa Nui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearest relatives. So how did they get there? And how did they build such advanced structures and invent their own agricultural system at such an early period in history despite being geographically isolated from civilizations with similar advancements? Number 5. \"The Island of The Dolls\"-The Mexico City borough of Xochimilco is steeped in Mexican history. Because it has long been the hub that connects the various canals and lakes of Mexico it has been the cultural melting pot of the country. One particular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfloating garden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the canals of Xochimilco may be eerie to outsiders but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s origins come from a caring place, in line with Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tradition of honoring those who have passed from this life to the next. The legend goes like this, one day a man found the body of a young girl who had met with a tragic fate in the waters of one of the canals. When he later returned to the spot he found her he spotted a doll floating in the water and believed it to have belonged to the girl. In order to pay tribute to the girl he tied the doll to a nearby tree. As the days passed he still felt like the girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at rest so he started to bring more dolls and hang them on the trees. Though no one knows if this story is more than myth, it has become a tradition to hang dolls on the trees of the floating garden which is now known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLa Isla de las Munecas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Island of the Dolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Although this tradition comes from the heart, it is still quite a frightening sight as the dolls are in various states of decay and some have even told tales of them coming to life. Number 4. \"Poveglia Island\"-Just off the coast of Venice, Italy lies Poveglia Island which may have one of the most twisted and horrifying histories of any island on Earth. During the devastating Bubonic Plague outbreak of the 14th century the government of Venice decided to try and quarantine the infected by sending them to Poveglia Island where they would live out the rest of their days. Because of this, even after the plague subsided the site became basically a national lazaretto and used anytime an outbreak of disease occurred. Poveglia would being to serve a new purpose in the 1920s when a mental hospital was built on it and the terrors that the patients were subject to at the hands of their caretakers only added to the haunting history of the island. The island has since fallen into dangerous level of disrepair and the Italian tourism bureau technically has forbidden people from visiting unless they go through an extensive application and interview process. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped ghosthunters and thrill-seekers alike from finding alternative ways to sneak onto the spooky island. Number 3. \"Isla Bermeja\" From the 1500s up until the late 1900s there existed an island off the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, at least according to maps there was. The islet of Bermeja was long used as the geographical boundary for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section of the Gulf but several mapping expeditions in the 20th century that went looking for the island frankly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. There are several theories as to how an island could appear on maps for the better part of four hundred years but then suddenly disappear. Most modern day experts believe that the island never existed at all and may have been the result of a cartographic mistake that went uncorrected. Some say that the island, which was described as being the color of strawberry blonde hair, did exist but sank into the ocean. This theory is backed up by British maps dating back to the 1840s which describe the island being slowly swallowed by the sea. However, there are those who believe that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance and the fact that it had political significance are not mere coincidence. Because the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most oil-rich regions on Earth some have theorized that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence was only perpetuated by the Mexican government in order to strategically extend their claim. On the flipside, there are also conspiracy theorists who believe the island did exist but was destroyed by the United States government for the same reason. Other conspiracies claim that the island still exists but that the evidence has been wiped from maps due to it being the site of top-secret activities. Number 2. \"Floating Eye Island\" While surveying the Parana Delta of northern Argentina in 2016 with the hopes of finding the perfect setting for his upcoming film, Argentinian filmmaker Sergio Neuspillerm found one of the most peculiar places in the world. Deep in the misty marshlands Sergio came upon a lake that appeared to be shaped like a perfect circle. Not only that, but there was an island in the lake that was exactly the same shape and it filled up the majority of the lake, leaving only a thin ring of water around it. Sergio was fascinated with the island that would come to be called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and quickly returned with a small research party. His team reported some strange findings. They found that the island was actually floating in the water and appeared to rotate around the lake on its own axis. They also say that the water was astonishingly cold and clear and the bottom of the lake was significantly harder than the rest of the ground in the area. Because of these mysterious observations Sergio decided to scrap the initial film project he was working on in favor of shooting a documentary on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Since the word got out on Floating Eye Island several conspiracy theories with it at the center have arisen. The most popular of these is that the island is covering a secret alien base. Number 1. \"Diego Garcia\" In the middle of the Indian Ocean is Diego Garcia Island which has been shrouded in conspiracy. The island, which is part of the Chagos Archipelago, was uninhabited when it was settled by French colonists in 1793 who brought hundreds of slaves to the islands to work their plantations. The island would eventually fall under British control as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. After slavery was abolished, the freed slaves (who had established their own cultural identity) stayed at the island and continued to till the land. But the Chagossians, as they had come to be called, were forced out of their home in 1971, in order to make way for a United States Naval Base. The US and UK had come to an agreement allowing the US Navy to take control of the island, but the base that the Navy wanted to build required the Chagossians to be unwillingly relocated. The arguably unethical methods the United States used to get the islanders to comply, such as slowly cutting off their supplies or euthanizing their pets would only add depth to the conspiracy theories that would subsequently arise about the island.", "Oh6xGGjW5R8": "", "tk_ZlWJ3qJI": "There is no secret that festivals are there to make money And for things to be effective, they do certain things To make you feel that you will win in some cases This is basically a hoax, so I spent some days counting For this festival, I monitor and collect information I have all the games and now I will tell you That is, his exact sale is considered theft and scientific reasons I have even painted exactly how much they pay For the prizes to win, but there is hope, and also because Show you some legal tricks in months the games This is what happens when you appear at the festival with your friend, a baseball professional The mets play Let's start Any type of forensic investigation needs constant data As a rule, so Churras promise unstoppable I have some hidden friends who collected the data About games at the festival all night is not only we collected How many times have we played the game and recorded how many times? How many times people have won and what rewards they have taken And the first note based on our data In this little garden This place makes 20 thousand dollars a day So let us help with the rest of the notes The games are divided into 3 groups first Are games with random opportunities Basically no games, no skills Like throwing a dice, the second is games that require skills Like baseball, a bottle of milk, or throwing a basket And games that need to attend skill or plan And you can increase your chance of winning and the last group Games that are somewhat impossible In short, it's a fool, and these are 3 games Many people try and do not succeed even if they win For example, in a game of climbing the ladder for certain reasons Which we will talk about later So let's start by talking about random games To calculate your chance is kinda straightforward, I just have to swear Chances of winning over college opportunities You will get a percentage and in this case there are about 1600 A cup and 160 cups can win There is a 10% chance of winning, one in 10 To win, there are a lot of similar games For this and be the trick about using light balls Which will mean that it will bounce well This makes the ball difficult to end And where will you aim? To clarify my point and how easy this game will be Pouch bags that are heavy and do not bounce Not perfect In your throw it will be clear which is considered the basis Something random and you have no skills in this They are the games you want to play but don't get excited about And because even when you win you will be a loser I did some investigations and uncovered some sources They ask for gifts and even if you are lucky In your first throw, you'll be lost a dollar and a half And the prizes themselves cost 45 cents But you do not succeed in the first attempt And treat this as if it were to be expected You take the rate 7/30 5 attempts in the yellow cup for the little prize, which means that you will pay 7.50 dollars For something with an original price of 45 cents In the event of a big prize in the beginning, it is rare In the golden cup and it will take in the normal 25 attempts, which is under $ 38 For a gift it costs $ 6 And how many people watch who win They match the stats and now we're talking about Skill-based games, the most popular game It is a baseball game that is 825 The day we watched it, the average was 3 points For about 24 feet on the edge of 10 feet In this case, the line is 28 feet off the edge And 11 feet high, which is considered normal, but if You have a lethal 3-point system In your muscles memory, which is normal, short memories And it is precisely what is happening, which is why they always get stuck in the front Is that no one stands below the edge, so they don't know the difference in length That would be very clear Here again if he goes to Stephen Curry If you dive or throw in $ 3, you will lose $ 2.20 Because hate costs them 80 cents, here is another example of getting You exaggerate your chances of winning by changing the way the table And that reduces the horizontal push after Apostasy and if even if you played the game during your college life Your previous experiences will be an obstacle And this measure will measure the speed of your throw And this speed gun says about 15 meters I know this because the distance and the image are very fast And the number of the number of tires that I took hatred, was about 84 And for the bottle, the soft bottle, the only trick is that the bottles are mineral That makes it more stable so it doesn't fall like regular bottles And that I saw after the festival puts a burden on the bottom of the bottle Which makes them more difficult to fall You can ask to carry it yourself until you are sure From her balance on my finger to be sure The key here is to hit it in the place Powerful enough to their rhythm But do not strike very hard because we noticed that those who strike with their strength They don't focus on accuracy About 1 in 14 people knocked them more on their first attempt. Then finally he played throwing the basket. The key here is It may bounce first hit on the front lip to reduce kinetic energy Enough not to rebound. About 1 in 10 people win this game according to our observations. And now this brings us to the last category of the near impossible Games There are three of them. The first time, target He is shooting from the Red Star with this automatic Bb gun. Next is the best shooting strategy mainly A circle around the beginning to cut it. Not only Guns are not accurate or precise, but the biggest issue is It starts to do really well because there is enough paper surrounding So the bb tore through the paper. But Newton Law 3 tells us you can only pay for something difficult They can also resist your pushing so at the end there will be barely noticeable Support the cut of a star that is just going out of the way Off the bb without building enough stress To tear the paper. From 120 plays Raina No one wins this day this game Ring Bottle Also difficult. Once again, it's a lightweight object This is really a bouncy to encourage randomness But the actual inner diameter of the ring is very close To the outer diameter of the bottle. This means no throw Besides this perfect, I will Send them bouncing away instead of settling in the bottle. If you really want this bear I suggest going to Amazon and getting it for $ 47. I literally couldn't tell you even how much money the Commandments would save you because of the 840 The rings we saw were thrown, leaving no one left Even a clear base of the thumb, if you want That the feeling of winning be a game, not playing any game that is presented Really great prizes. The final near is impossible A game let me repeat that the owner of the carnival most profitable Games are those that the customer has more than She appreciates her chances of success. No game is a better example From this from climbing the ladder. There is a hidden issue With this game that I think people realize, but does not understand the importance. The ladder turns to be supported on the wall by one point Instead of two. If it is attached in two points it's like Crawl across the bridge It is really easy. Let's pretend that this is You and if you shrink all your body weight Right up to the intermediate location that we call the center of mass, Which we will mark With this point. Once again, you know this is the place Because it is perfectly balanced. If you draw Two imaginary lines linking different support points And as long as the center of your cluster is a point It is impossible to fall. But once the center of mass is even a little bit out of the region It supports start to rotate and fall off. If you've ever bowed to pick something up You really know this fact, whether you realize it or not In this case the region of the support is between the heel And your toes when you reach more than you will Naturally move your butt back to maintain the center of your block Between your support points. If you don't believe me Try to catch something standing against a wall So you can move your bottom again, at the very moment your center of mass It moves behind your toes You are the other side. In the case of a ladder a game although it appears broad because of the ladder promoted, it just gets stuck At one point, however Although it seems broad due to Rogs' ladder This area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039support reduces to a line. that Even if you don't keep your cluster center directly above this line You will start spinning and falling from. In other words, to win this game You basically need to crawl through a tightrope. You probably thought we would be doing a slump line so I could do This however slack is actually much easier for 2 reasons You can linen your arms and legs to adjust Center your block to keep it above the line The support and status of your cluster is higher Even that makes you more stable In the same way, it is easier to balance this umbrella when it is extended than when it collapsed. Even while there are a few videos that say tricks like preserving three points From contact at all times, they're basically useless because Keeping your cluster center directly above a line It is just something you need to get to feel for it It takes a lot of practice. But once you've practiced enough for you this is one game in The carnival that is all skill. So you can win every time And cleaned. Unfortunately, the owner of the carnival knows this which is the reason for it The only game with this super lame warning. So far if we are carnival experts, I even called my friend Matt Winker Who played baseball for Stanford and was recently just drafted to play for the New York Mets So we can maximize the chance of winning any game related to throwing Clearly until he died he was a deadly lock on any throwing game But basketball is more than my own game until it's finished The day I decided to bring his ego back into the selection It turns out, if you are a class athlete in one sport You are really a good athlete in all sports So in conclusion, you should play games if you think they are fun Just know that the odds are highly stacked against that if you are He does not win it unlike this man who lost to him Life savings play carnival games. if it was Your motivation is getting love and admiration from a person Especially by stuffed animal you don't need Carnival to do so.

me to like slow it down I'm gonna zoom in right here so you can get a better view of the trucker flashing his lights at me and just around the corner a couple more bends then there's three police officers sitting on the side of the road waiting for people to come through now when I came through here they are right here on the right side of the road I came through completely obeying the law doing nothing wrong and they were just waiting for people to come through so they could pull them over and here's one more time zoomed in just so you could see how they're sitting waiting for the bread trucker to come along and get their spot on YouTube for the day well it doesn't take long for them to catch up with me down the road and pull me over for a pretty silly reason let's take a look  great good thanks wait Jenny Sheriff's Office Prince I stopped you have a little light out okay yeah your driver's license registration yeah what do you got in this van it's just uh it's like RV that

out doing a criminal interdiction on the highway today and I'm gonna run my canine around the outside of your vehicle is there anything that you want to tell me about before I do that no sir is there any user amount of marijuana or anything like that because if you tell me prior to we probably could show you some leniency but you know if I run the dog and I would do our search and the whole nine yards it's not gonna work out that way so is there a little user amount of marijuana in there there's no amount of marijuana it's no Mara no meth heroin cocaine that bombs no large amount of cash there's nothing in this truck this is your shifter  well it's just a gear shifter it says me with love in North Dakota I got this in my travels I don't worry guys coming from God she already asked me

well this one says it expired just a few days ago because it was effective August F 2018 expires August 10 2019 I just got these cards I got one more where do you see the expiration date  I don't see an expiration date on here I see an effective date  the expiration date isn't actually listed it says effective there's a date right there yeah and then right below it right here it says um this card is invalid wait let's see keep your current card until the effective date of this card you'll see the other one said it was expired within a year on the bottom of the other one okay follow me here this one doesn't not valid more than one year from effective date see that on the bottom yeah I have I have current I do have current insurance well my State Farm is like State Farm doesn't have all that online stuff progressive and because I used to have progressive it was really easy I have an imine it's super easy this is like I'm like State Farm just doesn't I mean I've had trouble getting into happen yeah cuz they have like private you know offices I okay do you mind if I see inside there I kind of do I'm sorry there's like a blue line or something in there I'm just curious well it's a little house back there it's the lighting system from my house I see  so that's why I pulled you over is is the light don't be offended we're stopping just about everybody we candidate for every violation like you said we're out here working at criminal nothing did it school looking for you're working away it's called an interdiction and we're looking for drugs okay is what we're doing so so we're stopping a lot of people I'm a k-9 handler too or running our dogs just about every vehicle so it's just the way it is okay okay um let me double check with him and then I think would be good

nothing anytime you drive away  concerning right here  absolutely  totally confident  but I'm just not letting  we started asking about looking look like a mess bye  pretty sure or  [Applause] I would have still said the same  you", "tasAi13pehA": "okay so a hot topic I get a lot of emails about this people want to ask about using air guns for self-defense now if you watched my previous video you'll know I don't typically recommend using air guns for self-defense myself I have a Texas concealed handgun license so I carry with me a real firearm every day in fact I've even been known to open carry my rifle with me on occasion when out shopping which is perfectly legal in Texas but I have to make a confession I also carry an air gun for self-defense semi-regularly the reason is simple there are places that I must go periodically that are gun free zones keep in mind that every gun-free zone is different and the laws vary a lot from state to state suffice it to say I've done my homework and the particular gun-free zones that I must go it's perfectly legal for me to carry pepper spray air guns or tasers into these places as such I typically carry pepper spray and an air gun because I don't like to be completely defenseless especially in places where criminals know everybody will be defenseless I also have a lot of viewers from Canada and other places where it's very difficult to obtain a firearm so one of the questions I get asked a lot is which is the best air gun to use for self-defense there are so many options to choose from I decided it would be best if I just gave you an overview of how to pick one for yourself it should be noted that there are at least four types of air guns airsoft paintball BB guns and pellet guns these are all very different and so I'm going to try to help you figure out which one would be best for you there are three main qualities that need to be taken into account realism firepower and reliability  so obviously the more realistic the gun is the better now let me quote you a statistic from Klecan Gertz of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year the overwhelming majority merely brandished their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers less than 8% of the time a citizen will kill or wound his or her attacker so this means that the air gun is realistic-looking you stand a 92% chance of being able to scare off your attacker without shooting him so that's pretty much going to rule out airsoft guns that have an orange tip as well as any with clear plastic I would also say any sort of BB gun has an unusual look to it I would typically suggest going for replica guns that look just like the real thing but even some non replica guns look very much like firearms at a glance also another advantage of having a replica air gun is that it will typically fit into the same holsters as the firearm that it replicates for example I've even been known to open carry around my Walther p99 Ram in a holster design for a Walther p99 so in the 8% chance you do not manage to scare off your attacker with a your gun then you're going to at least want something with a decent amount of firepower again this is going to rule out airsoft guns with their little plastic bb's these things just can't hurt anyone unless you get them straight in the eye okay so velocity is your friend here and it's going to be probably the most important factor in determining firepower now you're going to want an air gun that shoots at least 400 feet per second and they're not very many that do most of them shoot in the 200 to 300 feet per second now this is an example of one that's pretty good this is a gamma P 25 and it shoots at 450 feet per seconds and it shoots pellets now in fact believe it or not that is actually the reason I purchased this particular air gun is for those rare occasions where I need to use one for self-defense that's that's actually why I bought this one because it had high-velocity decently realistic and she's pellets okay and the last quality but definitely not the least is you need to make sure your airgun is reliable for example if they leak air then that's not gonna do you any good if you go to fire a shot and there's no air in the gun I've also seen some where if you tilt the gun forward a BB will just fall right out of the barrel and then that means your first shot is going to be nothing but pure air so you need to make sure that your gun works reliably I would test it over a period of several weeks before I would even consider carrying with me somewhere I also prefer pellets over bb's for several reasons but mostly because they tend to be stored in revolver style magazines which I think are more reliable so just keep in mind you get what you pay for any decent air gun is probably gonna cost at least $100 you can find a lot of them for thirty forty fifty dollars in your local sporting goods store most of those are probably junk okay now for the fun stuff I've set up several experiments I'm gonna walk you through I'm using a lot of cans of spam in this experiment and I'm gonna start with the paintball marker there are basically two common calibers 68 caliber and 43 caliber now the handguns typically use the smaller 43 caliber projectiles you can shoot several types of balls from these including paintballs plastic practice balls rubber balls and pepper balls the rubber balls sometimes called breaker balls are designed and marketed for self-defense they're basically solid plastic balls with a coating of hard rubber I'll be using this Walther p99 RAM for this test I will also mention that this marker is set to the factory velocity of around 290 feet per second but there is an adjustment inside that can increase this to around 400 feet per second so it can definitely put a nice dent in the can that looks like it would be very painful but would not cause any permanent injury next let's look at the pepper balls these things basically contain the same OC as you would find in a can of pepper spray but instead of spraying your attacker you'll be shooting them when these balls impact the surface they expel OC powder all around them if you shoot anywhere near your attacker space he'll be forced to breathe in the powder which will temporarily disable him okay so this is my friend Mason here and he's going he's volunteered to take a pepper ball or two in the name of science you find out they're effective  I would I would say it's not doing anything to me food no well that's where I hit him and it looks like I hit him twice in the same spot so uh we saw what it into your chest how did it feel well it definitely was I thought was a rushing assailant it would've definitely stopped me for a second unless I was probably on drugs or adrenaline I would have been able to just completely look past that so as a saying for everyday non-lethal used to carry yes if you're gonna use it for an every everyday I would probably get a probably I would get a more expensive pepper ball or I guess been around well of course I could have used the rubber balls and if the pepperball hurt and the rubber whatever rubber ball will definitely drop somebody I've seen that before and that's probably one of the biggest things I would use on the statement is just have that against this pepper ball now keep in mind we are out here with the wind is blowing about 20 miles an hour true I think we should do this another time and it endures closed area to get a better effect to see how that would go but then again you could be outdoors when this happens so based on it based on the experiment we just did I think I would rather keep it loaded with rubber balls yes I would definitely do that so let's move on to the pellet gun it's a much smaller projectile but it's made of lead and typically traveling much faster in a previous video I demonstrated that the pellet gun will shoot straight through a canvas Fancy's and when wrapped in a pair of denim jeans so we know these can definitely penetrate human skin and cause a lot of pain in a second test I wrapped up two cans of spam and a t-shirt there are a total of six layers of cloth between the gun and the spam this is to see how these guns perform through winter clothing I shot one can with a rubber ball and another a pellet as you can see the rubber ball still put a nice dent in the camera the pellet actually penetrated into the can at first I was perplexed why the hole is so large let's examine what's happening here if this is the spam and this is the fabric around it and this is the pellet the pellet actually penetrates into the can bringing the fabric with it creating a larger hole but as the fabric stretches like elastic it slows the pellet down and eventually pulls it back out I thought I'd try a third test with several different types of pellets in the my magazine to see if any particular one can trigger to clothing in a span better than the rest but it turned out there was no real difference in any of the pellets so I guess you can use whichever one you want I can already tell you if you look down in the comment section there's probably gonna be a lot of jackasses writing stuff they don't know anything about calling me a moron I mean idiot for suggesting that I my viewers use air guns for self-defense and most of them probably didn't even watch the video most of them probably saw the headline I thought that I was advocating use of air guns instead of firearms and that's just not at all what I'm advocating and a lot of these same people that are calling me a moron and telling you oh you'd be better off with a real firearm don't understand that not everybody can get a firearm and they also don't understand that it's not legal to take a firearm everywhere you want to go so I would just advise ignore those guys in the comments section and think about this logically and be sure you make good decisions um if you watch my other video on using air guns for self-defense you'll know that there are certain times even if you have it you're not going to want to use it for example if the other guys armed with a real gun forget it okay I mean they're only going to be certain circumstances where you would want to use this and you know I've thought about this a lot and let's say you're in a gun-free zone for example this is a very very unlikely situation but let's just imagine this is a worst-case scenario okay you're in a gun-free zone a guy comes in and he's just gonna mow everybody down and his goal is to kill everybody well you probably don't have anything to lose by going ahead and shooting as many pellets in this guy as you can but that's not a very realistic situation so in the situation where you got a heated argument in the gap pulls out a gun and you've got an air gun you're gonna want to play a different type of card and that is the card of apologizing sucking up your pride and doing whatever you've got to do to get out of that dangerous situation you don't want to provoke something like that into a worst-case scenario so just keep in mind I do advocate using these under certain circumstances but you need to use some common sense about when you're going to use them anyway I hope you found this video interesting and I do hopefully have some more coming out of the pipeline so I'll see you next time [Music]", "Uinir94KuFA": "[Music] and they ran I was here there were no other cars going so I'm assuming you still ride [Music]

okay ma'am I wrote to his summons for the speed I also shoot one for failing to have a valid insurance car in your possession okay what you're going to do with that something some mandatory court appearance because what they gonna need to do is make sure that you had insurance on the date and time that you were stopped okay the only thing they're going to do is just check it's already written ma'am for me to have to go to court you want me to go man the tickets already written I can't avoid a summons once a story loss that's fine okay ma'am if you have any other questions reference the

Charles 8 3 4 9 f JC 83 40  I've worked  [Music] you know get a license registration on him I know what this is about  okay I'm sorry  and I'm right [Music] why is there something wrong okay the well the registration that you have affixed to the window here expired the 10th of May oh I got a new one okay got a new one the clerk you can check with the clerk it's free its renewed I forgot to put it on there okay the reason why I appreciate being honest about the phone the reason why I pulled over is because when you passed me you were doing 43 in the 30 that's 13 miles per hour over the speed limit on Ulster I have enough when we were passing a firehouse I understand well let me just tell you  I understand just that Avenue is always like people are always passing each other especially at the time of day we try to slow motorists I understand I know I understand here Oh  everything is  you know I work for the county okay now any government I'm gonna County Legislator I'm going to meet the possible okay if you have the old one that's fine I can run the same number  oh you're not going to give me a ticket are you I haven't decided yet I mean I haven't decided yeah I just want this looking for the documents there's here's my card okay okay it's no reason to cry well it's my job okay just a driver's license and do you have the registration for vehicle you can have your car back there  okay to find the registration for me I appreciate it  ma'am I mean the longer though it's the longer you're going to be here that's that's the insurance do you have the registration card it should be a little yellow card all right this one's like that one was expired in 2011 if you find the registration card just hold it out the window and I'll come get it okay  everybody but if it's over the okay  easy  you want to sit down video right here and the whole conversation been recorded here too like I said the reason why I pulled you over was because you were going 43 into 30 which was 13 over okay that was every car I couldn't do slower that's that was your words okay I had 243 and a 30 which was 13 over you did admit to me that you're on your phone talking to your son I know I was on speakerphone okay  okay you're you're doing  [Music]  right can I explain this to you Jay is on the phone with the sheriff right now we're gonna have a conversation about it I'd like to I'd like to record this in front of the sheriff I want to hear all right would you like me explain this to you I want you to explain to chip money  what you're doing it's correct here we go I'm gonna here's your license back okay how much are you charging me I'm not charging anything  this license expired I want him to explain it in front of you because he pulled me over I was going the same pace as all the other cars and I feel like given what's going on with this thing with the sheriff this week I can't I don't know if I can trust law enforcement I need a witness  [Music]  can I explain this I could say please okay is everybody listening I can explain it you could just calm down for one minute I can explain everything to you and then I'll give you as much opportunity to speak to me as possible but you haven't stopped talking so I can explain everything to you explain to you anything about the ticket yet man this is the first time I've ever encountered you okay about you okay the reason why I pulled you over like I said was going 43 into 30 that was 13 miles per hour over to Sue's team okay I've got to this point four times now and I have been able to get past that point because you're interrupts I just would like to explain the ticket to you and then you'll be more I'll be more than happy because even though everyone was going at the same speed you had to single somebody out now I did not know so not my word that's what you said before them everything has been taped recorded I said I can't pull everyone over that's how the police do it that's safe we'd only pull one just choose one particular person one particular car that's going over the speed limit speed limit I was trying to keep the traffic alright can I explain this to you please guys I don't consider it I don't feel safe anymore 3 I copy everything's being audio and video recorded man ok you don't feel safe around ok well I was going to explain to you that the reason why I pulled you over was for the speed and I was cutting you a break and not issuing you for the speeding ticket if you can see here it says the new license and registration I did an issue for that ma'am you have a valid license and valid registration you just didn't present that to me the expired ones in the window and you present to me an expired license but I was able to check that on the computer to see that they were both valid  everybody's listening right now the reason why I pulled you over was for the speed I was cutting you a break and issuing you for no seatbelt I'm aware that you were wearing your seatbelt but this is a non-moving violation it doesn't occur any points and it doesn't affect your drive home are you understanding what I'm saying to you I could get points I pulled you over for the speed I could have my insurance changed correct convicted would be four points on your license so I was cutting you a break and not issuing you in support because this is incorrect charge ok that's fine I will go back and I'm going to issue the speeding ticket and not give you the seat belt  Patrick  here's the ticket that I pulled you over for it was speed and zone like I said I got to go I have a copy of the original one that you brought to me because that was already printed out so it's on the record okay that's right this is what I know this is a ticket this is what I originally pulled you over for with speed and zone for speed originally printed okay that was for a seat belt but that's not what you wanted you said you wanted which was speed and zone which is forty three and a thirty okay that's what the tickets for all right I made the ticket returnable for June fourteenth and five o'clock okay you can make your plea you can you can make your plea of guilty or not guilty on the backside of the ticket here and you can send it in to this address by this date  do you have any questions ma'am  okay well it's it's my discretion on which ticket that I issue this is what I should the other one okay but this is what I pulled you over for I didn't pull you over for seat belt pulled over for speed so it's my discretion if I want to issue the seat belt or the speed and understand what you were doing and you went back to get me the other I've been trying to explain this very nicely so you for a half hour now no I said well they didn't understand no you didn't say that you didn't understand we specifically told me that's not what I pulled over for so I said I would kindly go back and issue the ticket why I pulled you over and that's what I'm doing okay all right so this is a speeding ticket for forty three and a thirty when I originally pulled over for it's returnable for the fourteenth at five o'clock saying you kindly went back say that you kindly went back this is the appropriate hold over for I'm not arguing with you question you said that you very kindly would Mack to give me something brushed I've been kind through the whole time since I asking you to be kind and I think that I've explained and  that's no I said I kindly went back would you kindly go back and explain to me this is a ticket that I'm issuing it depends on whether you plead guilty or not guilty I will plead not guilty but I don't think what you did was you didn't excite I mean unfortunate I mean that that's your opinion if you know I would like you to be corrected so there's that's the ticket okay I can't afford this okay I wish I you know what I already lost that job it was a job so now what I will do is all just are you going to take the ticket or you're not going to take I don't really know what my rights are would you tell me let's let's just stay here and you can tell me what my rights are because they did rights were that if I didn't understand the previous ticket you would make a harsher one okay but this isn't a horseshoe one man this is the appropriate second the reason is because what you explained to me before was that the other one would let me off with fewer what I didn't understand that can you explain it to me give it then you said to me that that's not the ticket the reason why I pulled you over so I went back and I issued the appropriate ticket for you this is the appropriate ticket I pulled you over for okay explained everything to you if you want to take again you can plead not guilty we can discuss your well what's the previous one that you have explained everything to you or didn't understand about 30 minutes of just landing let's see I've already missed my job interview now I'm asking I have other stuff that I need you to put in the tax explained everything to you to the best of my ability you did yes I didn't I'm not gonna argue with you any further if you have any further questions you can plead not guilty and we can discuss it in court okay you be there if you choose to play not guilty yeah because I'd really like to discuss we did not  you can request that when you go to court wait you can request it I've been standing here explaining everything to explain what the previous one meant and I didn't okay have a good day ma'am  [Music]  alright drop it on this side okay where are you coming

Louis des your birth date is 827 60 I sir it was a moment packed with emotion the end of a legal battle for Miami Dade County Commissioner Jose Pepe Diaz who was charged with DUI after he was pulled over for speeding on his horley in Key West back in 2015 now inside the courtroom Diaz embraced his family in fact he even walked across the courtroom so he could shake the hand of the arresting officer this is not easy and it's a lot of stress on your family your friends constituents and everybody else but I believed in that was innocent prosecutors spent two days trying to prove to jurors that Diaz was drunk in the video Diaz admitted he had had two drinks earlier at a pool party  but he insisted he wasn't over the limit after officers pulled him over for doing 74 in a 30 mile per hour zone mr. Diaz  but his defense fired back telling jurors that mr. Diaz is overweight and no one not even a professional athlete could have completed those tests without error I'm not proud of those a lot of those moments but I've learned from them and I will do with that [Music]  [Music]  the right lane their reasons why II couldn't maintain delay any medical conditions diabetes anything like that no no okay do you have anything to drink tonight no why we're

the big live returns now with Matt Gutman in these cynical times when heroes are scarce Navy SEALs may be the one thing Americans can't still believe in capable of almost superhuman feats of combat skill and endurance they are the real deal famed for taking out those enemy number one Osama bin Laden Hollywood has turned the seals real-life exploits in the big-budget movies like the just-released flick lone survivor so if you happen to meet a seal you might react the way Carol Roberts did when she met AJ dickin  what was your first impression of him he's a big guy he commands are thorny by his size it was 2011 in Carson City Nevada Carroll herself a Navy vet was a student at Dickens military-style self-defense school that's thicket running and gunning in videos he made to promote his business it looked like a lot of fun learning from a Navy SEAL was part of the fun but Dickon wasn't just any old seal he clammed tours of duty in Vietnam Naida Desert Storm you name it he's been there earning him the status as the most decorated Navy SEAL in history if anyone asks for proof he had his discharge papers at the ready even emails from Colonel Oliver North [Music] stop the truck picking self-defense school was a success but he dreamed way bigger he wanted to set up his own lucrative overseas security business to bankroll his new venture to concern to a pair of local doctors enrolled in his self-defense classes the shabby seal talked him into investing upwards of eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars he said mom ex-navy seal then I went into the CIA he can be very charming very engaging he presents a face that kind of draws you in Dickens mystique and the allure of a big payout led Carol Roberts to sign on as the marketing director of the new firm they needed somebody to do their marketing and so I said I'll do it so you actually quit a good job in order to work with Dickon yeah because you thought the money was coming in yeah I had seen the contracts that were for hundreds of millions of dollars yeah yep dicken that smooth-talking seal had landed a security contract with the United Nations affiliated organization allegedly working about a half a billion dollars it's all coming together AJ Dickens excellent adventure is getting off the ground all of this I think it was like we're leaving for Burundi in a week no this isn't the script for an action flick but the first bit of business for Dickens new venture deep in the African nation of Burundi there's a construction project looking to hire a security firm Dickon leads an expedition there to seal the deal Carol Roberts is part of that team as is chief pilot Mike Reynolds but shortly after they land wheels start falling off by the second day we realized that people didn't know who we were what we were doing there his house of cards started to crumble the business trip to Burundi has turned into a bungle in the jungle and when the going gets tough the tough get drunk he'd fill up a glass of vodka and have that down for breakfast it was insane the whole situation there was just dangerous Carol suspicion grows when the power goes out in the hotel and the supposedly steely nerves seal near wets his fatigues he freaked out picked up his phone runs into the other room talking to the CIA to have them reposition the satellite so he can make sure that the rebels aren't coming to get it no yes just then a friend back in the States keeps Carol on the team off to a strange video just posted on YouTube if I get  the guy in the video isn't some lunatic he's actually a real former Navy SEAL one senior chief Don Shipley I knew right away you weren't a fake I all I got to do is check your name I'll check your name just like that a couple of keystrokes I say if that guy was ever ceiling simply has made it his personal mission to ferret out the fakes every single day using a special database only real seals can access how many guys have you exposed houses thousands oh yeah I verify on average at least 20 fraudulent seal claims every day but Shipley says AJ Dickon was no ordinary seal faker for one thing his claims were so over-the-top remember those discharge papers the awards and hero outrageous why they outrageous all he says he's got two medals of Honor that hasn't happened since World War one in fact they can never serve the day in the military and his phony resume was missing a few details like the burglary conviction that landed him in a California prison for the team back in Burundi that last bit of Dickens cover is blown to bits but knowing he's a fraud is cold comfort you're sitting in the middle of Africa with somebody that you're pretty convinced at this point is a sociopath the best a psychopath at worst the team hightails it back to Nevada and Carol Roberts wastes no time blowing the whistle about the real AJ dicking I went to one of the doctors with all of the evidence I had and said you have a problem it was all a great big fraud Dickon was fired and skips town leaving only burned bridges and emptied wallets months later dick and is back on the radar when ABC station kgo picks up his trail leading to his parents house outside Los Angeles I'm going to talk to you about your but your Navy SEAL background I don't have a Navy SEAL backgrounds so a lot of people that didn't you know I did not now true to form dick and heads for the hills again but nobody is sure wedge hills until a few months ago so we've try to track down dicking for weeks now finally we know where he is where he's gonna be 2020 track dicking to a secluded property in rural Arkansas where the road ends the man doesn't get out much anymore but finally we spotted him how you doing mr. Dickie I'm not coming from ABC these appear to be your discharge papers and folks in the Navy SEAL community say that you're not a commando you're a con artist well if you actually talk to me I'd like to hear your side of the story sir but dickin can't drive away so easily we saw a shady past here we go he's an ex-con still banned from handling weapons in this Rambo routine is illegal and now he's facing felony firearms charges in Nevada but as of today AJ Dickens still walks the earth maybe not as a seal that as a free man the people who say he's condemned are hoping to see him soon wearing a different kind of uniform you'll never get paid back for what you lost but can he ever get pay back to be able to bring this to light and not just sweep it under the rug is what my paybacks gonna be

designers for speed and agility and by their crews for being the right tanks for the wrong war [Music] how many times have you seen images like this from film shot during World War two  powerful American Sherman tanks rolling across the European countryside delivering firepower to Allied ground troops where it was needed most the Sherman tanks weight class was somewhere between a light tank which was small and a heavy tank was a big monster it was designed to go over military bridges it was designed to fit on railroad cars it was designed for easy transportation it was designed for automotive reliability when the decision was made to invade Europe General George S Patton himself selected the Sherman as his tank of choice he said we don't need a heavy tank we can win the war with this medium tank make as many of those as you can Sherman tanks rolled off American assembly lines by the thousands nearly 50,000 total when they reached Europe three to five man tank crews immediately took them into battle the image of the approaching Sherman's became a myth like representation of the invincibility of America's war machine  but those who actually fought it and maintained the Sherman tanks claimed the invincibility was a myth and as far as their design for World War two is concerned the tanks were engineering disasters [Music] Milton Cooper served as a captain on a Sherman tank maintenance unit in the American 3rd Armored Division he recounted his experiences in a book titled death traps Cooper vividly remembers the first time he approached a disabled Sherman tank  the first shot had gone through the transmission and in addition to the forces robbing the transmission is going through a five inch steel driveshaft and that stopped the tank the second shot went hit the top of the turret and cut a three-inch grew through about three inches Rama in the blast killed a tank gunner when I saw that I thought this tank had just had to protect you know and then after that they started bringing tanks in droves with the dead and wounded inside and it was as terrible and I knew then that we had an inferior tank  we had short-barrel guns designed to shoot high-explosive shells at a fairly low speed mm fee a second the German guns would shoot a solid shot at 3,500 feet per second that meant that they had to three times the penetrating power of our armor-piercing shells and so they went through our tanks like a hot knife through butter the Sherman's may have had the speed and mobility so highly regarded by Patton but those were not the qualities needed to fight the larger German tiger and Panther tanks the statistics from Belton Cooper's unit speak for themselves we lost 648 tanks totally destroyed in combat another 700 knocked out and repaired and put back in action that's thirteen hundred and forty eight tanks knocked out in combat says five hundred eighty percent loss I don't think anybody took that kind of loss in the world Army Navy Air Force submarines method like that in one unit they sent 18 of these newly crewed tanks into combat and in the first 20 minutes 17 of them are lost it was murder [Music]  it really was almost criminal what our forces had to put up with because we didn't have the right tanks  why were the Sherman's so vulnerable for starters their offensive power was hindered by inadequate weaponry I have a letter and I filed that came from General Eisenhower and he wrote directly to general Rhodes and he said general Rhodes I know you've been losing a lot of tanks I'd like to have you ask your crew and your tank commanders and your combat commanders why are we losing so many Sherman tanks in the best answer he gave was by a tank gunner who said general in order to knock out a German tank I've got to get that 600 yards and catch it on the flank they could knock me out of 2,000 yards head over for all practical purposes a Sherman could successfully battle the German tank  from just one direction the only way our tanks could defeat their tanks is if we could run around behind them and shoot him the rear end where there wasn't much armor we did that but typically it would take five tanks being blown up before the sixth one got around to shoot a German tank at the back the mathematics were not good when it became clear to American tank commanders that their Magnificent war machines were so vulnerable they resorted to makeshift methods that would add defensive capabilities and length to their lives anything that they could gather that they can put on that faceplate to protect it they put logs they put steel plate they put chicken wire backed up with points and concrete in the faceplate anything that could get on that to get my threat of survival but for the most part any effort to improve the Sherman's was futile to make matters worse Sherman's required highly flammable high-octane gasoline their engines were originally designed for airplanes in every decision that was made in the development and use of the Sherman from beginning to end they had to make choices between options okay we need a high powered engine with light weight okay we use this engine it's an aviation engine it burns more flammable fuel but power is the most important thing power and weight or we need a tank that can move very fast to exploit a breakthrough so we can't have real heavy armor because that would slow it down we'll have just enough armor for what we think we need the job of a Sherman tank maintenance engineer was a grizzly one we had to clean the tanks out it's a terrible job to clean out a tank with the head shot off in the arms and legs dismembered it's just awful and we had to put them in inside the tanks to get the bodies out and wrap them up in a tarp and then it would put him outside and that the tank crews knew that when they got in that tank he went to battle if they got hit they would go be in bad shape their tanks were knocked out and sent back to repair and then they came back and they got into a tank that had just been freshly painted to cover over the bloodstains that had obvious patches in it from where the mechanics had plugged the holes they knew what they were going up against they knew they were outclassed they knew that if they ran up against a tiger or a Panther tank they were in a lot of trouble we were just inadequate that's all I can say we just did not understand what we were doing that's a great tragedy", "v7JATeB8Ug0": "this segment will demonstrate the successful methods strategies and technologies used to remove 40 feral hogs from a single location over three and a half months we will discuss each step in detail to reinforce the ability to perform 100% capture results in less than perfect conditions this was one of our most difficult and frustrating hog removal projects to date as a Sanders had been educated by three different sources first there was a high population of dog hunters in the area which pressured hogs every weekend and changed their feeding and movement patterns second gun hunters only shot adult sales at automatic feeders which made the rest of the sounder negatively associated bait sites to danger areas lastly the landscape was littered with these 5 by 10 portable traps which only captured a few juveniles but educated the adults to avoid future of metal contraptions the first step of our capture success matrix is to condition hogs to trust a daily food source we erected this feeder on 10 January to begin collecting Intel and documented very odd behavior during the next six weeks there were six different Sounders using the bait site but they only visited the area once ever seven to nine days one week we counted 25 hogs to the next it was only 19 total we counted 40 different pigs from six separate Sounders we shot these three motherless pigs as they were isolated by themselves at a midday food plot two hundred yards from the bait site we erected our standard 35 foot diameter enclosure between two heavily used trails to mine gates were placed at opposite ends of the trap to allow two separate entrances and exits hopefully this strategy would overcome the PhD education and trap avoidance these hogs had previously learned notice we carefully camouflaged both gate entrances and T posts with pine trees and branches we timed and tested our camera transmitter to both gate receivers for simultaneous discharge then hand mated with soured corn to begin step two of our capture success matrix we knew conditioning hogs to trust the Corral enclosure as a daily food source would be more difficult as a Sounders only visited the bait area one day per week and already associated feeders and traps to danger the first sounder visit to the enclosure took place on 28 February at 1855 these 19 juveniles entered both gates of the enclosure and nervously fed for approximately 40 minutes before quietly leaving the second visit to the enclosure took place on March 2nd at 1916 these juveniles were from the 19th Pig sounder and the 6th Pig sounder at 22 14 they spooked for no apparent reason and quickly departed the trap notice a few pigs from the new sounder become confused about the exit locations this negative experience will sometimes make pigs more apprehensive to enter the enclosure next time these 15 pigs are from a completely different sounder they enter the enclosure on March 3rd at 1823 notice the black boar in the background completely avoiding the trap March 2nd and 3rd was a Saturday and a Sunday watch their nervous behavior and listen to their vocalizations as they enter the enclosure on the following Friday night March 8 at 2104 this behavior was becoming very frustrating for our team we had good intel on their numbers with 37 pigs from six different Sounders and four different adults out but only juveniles were using the bait site one day per week and usually on the weekend the only logical conclusion was these hogs were pressured by dog or gun hunters from another location and only showed up to our location on the weekends we decided to drop the gates the next time we had 25 or more hogs inside the enclosure using this Intel these hogs show up one week later on Friday night 15 March at 1931 here is footage of sound number two refusing to enter the enclosure yet again this camera has been at the enclosure for over two weeks and she acts as if this is the first time she notices it we distinguish each sounder by uniquely marked pigs notice the white Poland China gilt between the feeder legs at 1937 last week was the first time her sounder entered the enclosure finally at 1954 the white Poland China exits and sound number one has entered the enclosure for the first time she is the red hand standing at the top of the screen between the feeder legs with a white belt across her shoulders we believe there are now 31 pigs inside the enclosure and we are waiting on the last three juveniles Tanner the white pole in China or sound number 2 delivered an alert runt from outside the enclosure and eliminated our best trapping opportunity to date only a fraction of the pigs returned to feed for another 10 minutes and were incredibly nervous the entire time here is a rare look at sound number 3 at 1959 she never entered the enclosure during the entire month of trapping operations the sounder exits the enclosure leaving bait on the ground the next trapping opportunity took place nine days later on Sunday night 24 March at 22:14 notice how incredibly nervous the sounder appears this was only the sixth time pigs had been at this location during the past four weeks farmers had already begun planting corn and we knew trapping chances would diminish in future weeks we changed our mission focus to capture as many of the remaining 37 hogs as possible in the trap enclosure and then shoot the rest during thermal operations at night the group returns two minutes later at 22:16 and cautiously enters the gate threshold we currently have 21 pigs feeding inside the enclosure and seven more still outside two minutes later at 22 18 these four pigs enter while three remain outside we observe the bait site for an additional six minutes calculating our odds at capturing the entire sounder the past months Intel of nervous behavior from surrounding hunting and trapping pressures combined with lessons learned from last week's missed opportunity along with increased corn planting acreage told us the smartest decision was to capture this group and attempt to shoot the remaining 12 during thermal operations at 20 to 24 we simultaneously dropped coal mine gates to capture 25 pigs  [Applause]  this is one of the few times our team did not immediately kill pigs inside the enclosure because we knew it would be impossible to trap the remaining 12 leaving pigs inside a trap overnight destroys the opportunity to capture another sounder for two reasons first even domestic pigs are intelligent enough not to urinate or defecate where they eat or sleep their bathroom area is always located outside their feeding and bedding areas second leaving pigs inside a trap overnight allows them to communicate distress to others in the area many of our subscribers have asked to hear these vocalizations here was a perfect opportunity to deliver these sounds  we killed these 25 inside the enclosure on the morning of 25 March within shot the remaining 12 at an adjacent location a few weeks later during thermal operations at night combined with a three Juvenal shot in February we still achieved 100% success by removing 40 of 40 hogs in the area we needed to demonstrate the integrated pest management approach by using multiple methods and technologies when traditional hunting and trapping pressures from surrounding locations produced erratic behavior and trap avoidance high volume feral hog control is more art than science the next video in our series will continue

lot of hard work our land now looks like this  [Music] this all started after myself and my wife bought a 42 acre piece of land that had been for sale for quite some time  [Music] it was heavily treated with invasive maple trees that had not been thinned or maintained ever  [Music]  while these trees were invasive we didn't want to remove all of them but we did want to remove enough to have a usable piece of land [Music]  after hand drawing the plans for a fairly simple house we got our permit to build and the work began  initially the house was going to be right around 1,600 square feet with a few bedrooms upstairs in one great room downstairs we are good to go  initially the plan was to subcontract out the things we weren't comfortable doing do the things we were comfortable doing try to save money in between and wrap it up in a 30-year mortgage because our land is 2.6 miles from the nearest powerline nobody wanted to finance the project  this caused us to do some serious reflection and reevaluate just in fact what we could and couldn't do  I have 15 years in the plumbing trade but above and beyond that I had zero other construction experience good help has been hard to find [Music] we started with the septic system got a little bit of help from a few friends to pour the foundation and from that point on basically did everything ourselves  up to this point I had very little framing experience I had framed up maybe a shed and a little bit of interior work in a remodel but that was it  I did what I knew how to do I talked to the right people when I didn't know what to do [Music]  I looked for discounts where I could get them paid cash as we went  [Music] conventionally framed the entire house and did virtually everything myself  [Music]  along the way we battled every kind of weather you can think of [Music] along the way I've lost a few things mainly a few pounds but I found something that has given me more purpose in life than almost anything else  [Music]  when the cost to build an average home in the area is north of a hundred and fifty dollars a square foot we've managed to keep our costs around $16 a square foot  [Music]  after getting the lower portion of the land thinned and cleared and as we began to understand just in fact the beauty that we had we felt that the rustic doug-fir siding would be perfect up here  [Music]  my trusty sidekick Ruger has never let me down regardless of the conditions [Music] because the bank told us no it forced me to figure out ways to save money which ultimately meant that I was going to do everything from the septic system to the gas line to the electrical to the roofing to the siding to the solar system everything that will be necessary to give us the 21st century comforts that we're looking for  I had never done anything significant with electrical but I had a couple of good friends that were willing to talk me through it as I had questions our only source of heat is a wood-burning stove in the last three years that we've owned the land we've had as much as four feet of snow  we framed the house to handle well over a hundred pound snow load  as we got deeper into construction we realized that we needed more room our intentions are to keep everything associated with a solar system inside the house we've had more challenges along the way than I could have ever imagined  there have been moments where I wondered if this would ever come to an end  there have been moments where I figured out why nobody had ever built a house up here in the first place the end result is we're three years into this in the house is nearly finished  we have nearly a 2,000 square foot house that's very well built that we love it's paid for [Music]  we poured another 400 square feet of concrete which gave us a utility room for the water heater and everything associated with the solar system as well as another bedroom in the bathroom we've had just as many ups as we've had downs along the way but we're in the homestretch  [Music] we're moments away from moving in  while we have many other projects like a root cellar like building my shop like building a cabin on the back section of our property we first can't wait to just move in I then dug a shallow well ran over a thousand feet of waterline to a water tank that's over a hundred feet above the house  [Music]  after hauling the water tank up the hill and getting it properly positioned getting the solar well pumps in place we have water  [Music] there's no question that hindsight is always 20/20 [Music]  knowing what I know now if I could go back to the beginning and start over I most definitely would have done things different  [Music] I most definitely would have avoided some of the mistakes I've made and some of the changes that we've had to embrace but what's the point if this was easy everybody would be doing it sometimes it's hard to know what we're capable of until we're put in situations where we just have to get things done [Music]  I've made mistakes I will make more mistakes I promise but anything worth doing is gonna be hard this is probably the hardest thing I've ever done in my life [Music]  second only to being a husband and a father it's definitely one of the most rewarding things I've ever done we've got a lot more projects to come and I've got a lot more learning to do [Music] my shop foundation walls have been waiting for me for two years that's also on the short list [Music] the upstairs is nearly finished with drywall I'm about to transition to the downstairs drywall then it's paint kitchen cabinets then we'll probably move in we've saved more money along the way than I ever could have imagined we are nearly finished with our mortgage free home living in one of the most beautiful spots on the planet as hard as this has been we wouldn't change it for the world we have individual playlists of every phase of construction that we've gone through nearly 300 videos  [Music] don't forget to subscribe to see what the next three years look like you", "351MeHVANao": "guys welcome back to another episode of Atlas for Bible shelters today's video is going to be about the ten coolest places I have found to hide all those guns in plain sight and the coolest furniture I've ever seen in my life I hope you enjoy the video I'll see you at the end what if when you woke up the intruders were already in your room at that point reaching for a firearm may tip off the intruder where your gun is and get you killed there is a solution the patent-pending gun bed the gun bed is quite possibly the biggest breakthrough in home defense since the invention of the firearm the gun bed allows fast access to a firearm while keeping it secure off the floor out of the closet or the nightstand and away from curious children when locked in the event you hear an intruder and think it would be wise to investigate the shotgun can quietly be removed although I used the loudest racking shotgun I could find because the last sound in an intruder wants to hear is the sound of a shotgun racking a shell that sound is a universal language that may cause an intruder to flee without any confrontation at all notice the muzzle goes past the second person's head and the natural movement brings it farther away from your loved one for this reason never store a pistol in the gun bed  the bed bunker is made in the USA is a concealed safe that replaces your box springs fits any standard sized bed the multi locks are the highest security locks available in the industry the safe carries a two hour fire rating holds up to 35 rifles and 70 handguns many people have asked me how long does it take to access your bed bunker it takes less than 10 seconds guns are right beneath you so you can access them in a hurry the door weighs 140 pounds and is spring-loaded so when you unlock the locks the door pops open each section of the bed safe weighs six hundred and fifty pounds the safe is made of 10 gauge steel on the body and the doors are made of quarter-inch steel the complete safe is powder coated and comes with a lifetime warranty we all get in half a queen bed bunker there safe and it's it's very wide and it's very long so it will accommodate someone that's up to like seven three [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  mala you got a very comfortable couch and as you can see I'm a little over six feet there's plenty of room extra room at then to sleep [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  hey guys now Mill starts coming up with a real quick video I want to show you an item I got today in the mail from Casey he's was Liberty home concealment out of normal with Missouri cool thing about this thing is you can get a magnetic or electronic card for this thing it's got a little lock inside for some storage a large compartment down here at the bottom and then a smaller one up top as you can see I've put my block 19 in here got room space for another cutout to put another pistol in there hopefully I do a little better cutting it up and I did on my 19 but hey trial and error but this thing is awesome beautiful this is really cool I really like this thing  [Music]  hello I'm Josh Johnson with a covert concepts secret door company today I want to show you our stealth series wall mirror it comes in two 56 by 13 inch size it also comes in a 13 by 13 inch size you can learn more about those on our website all of our products are handmade here in the USA with solid cabinet grade woods the back is padded with a soft velcro to help protect the finish of

several different stock colors or we can custom make one out of any species of wood any obstructions inside the wall such as plumbing electrical wall ties etc look for obstructions on the face of the wall such as light switches door trim picture frames etc next you want to choose a inconspicuous location such as next to the bathroom where people would expect a mirror to be hung I would not recommend putting in your living room or somewhere where it's not obvious that a mirror should be you need to decide which direction the mirror will slide open you can either have a slide to the left or slide to the right [Music] you're sitting down having a nice meal and suddenly they hear some commotion outside and somebody comes bursting through your door well there you go you can have this sitting right on your dinner table you can have this full of apples and bananas or your bread for the evening and there's your firearm right there I started in this because just on a lark a couple of my girlfriends and I took a concealed carry class I'd never held a gun in my hands ever until then I found it very empowering then about six months later I got laid off and I was looking for furniture like this and couldn't find it anywhere so then that's when I decided well if I'm looking for it then there's got to be other people looking for it as well here's our bedside table a lot of people really love this piece because of the simplicity and great style both sides open up so you can have your firearm right next to your bed in a beautiful little table that still functions the way it should and again solid wood construction here's a console table functions much the same as this one side pops down but this one will hold a long gun as well so you can have a handgun in each end long gun across the back can be sitting in the middle of your living room looking gorgeous and nobody needs to be the wiser we call this our step-back curio cabinet and this is fun because it is so well concealed we just have fun with this one there's a little lever up here that opens this opens there's four inches of space back there so you can have one side for jewelry one side for firearms the whole thing for firearms the whole thing for jewelry people have done it both ways and then the bottom opens on this as well luckily we have this fantastic resource that's about an hour south of where I live which is the largest Amish community in the world and there's a lot of unbelievably good furniture makers down there and I found a really really good one who makes all this beautiful furniture for me it's all coming out of the same workshop down there so everything is made one at a time by hand to order everything is custom built so you get exactly what you want [Music] you  we have our unique feature with this one  is our hidden storage on the delight bridge you have to open areas for the lights a center area that has velvet lining and a beautiful mirror so when you're in bed you can see what's up in the the velvet lined area furniture traditions was the first company to make a mirror with a hidden storage compartment to this day it's still the best hidden storage compartment mirror on the market you have the beautiful wings that full closed and the center section which opens to reveal a beautiful velvet lined area for necklaces rings studs whatever you might have and the soft close feature so the mirror will never have to worry about slamming closed or being open it'll automatically close on its own you have our beautiful 2320 treasure chest the other reason this is called his treasure chest is the hidden treasure drawer [Music]  locking velvet-lined easy access the perfect place where no one will think to look these also have a special glide on them that when they get close it automatically sucks it in so you never have to worry about drawers rolling now it in falling apart are you ready for this patented swing arm design this is a unique patented design that only is available by furniture traditions once again you can hold up to a 47 inch TV you can turn it into a gun cabinet you can have a magnetic latch two thumb latches to keep the kids out and a key lock  [Music] this is how it opens fingers there come on a little closer come around this I'll show you how the fingers thing works finger through the knot and then you pull that trigger on the other side just like that here opens up just like that you can do the same thing there what you see in front of you is a typical sofa table but this one has a secret 36 inches tall 12 inches deep and about five feet long this one has a two and a half inch deep hidden storage compartment right here that is secured by a magnetic lock what we've done is we've recessed a rare-earth magnet in the bottom of this piece right here if when we put it over the area where the magnetic lock is it unlocks it and gives us access to the top so whether you're trying to secure firearms because you have children in the home or maybe you just want to have a place where you can have access to something that no one else knows about this is going to be the thing for you so you simply take the secret key that we have in the bottom of this if you heard that click right there now it's unlocked and you have access to the hidden compartment now in ours we have it configured for our firearms in this compartment we have two revolvers a 357 and a 38 here we have two Smith & Wesson 9 millimeters with extra magazines and a 12-gauge double-barrel shotgun two LED flashlights and some extra rounds with a shotgun when you order yours the Kaizen foam that comes in the top of this will be completely uncut and literally all you have to do is lay down whatever it is that you want to store drop around it with a sharpie and then cut that outline with an exacto knife some kind of a razor blade knife there's our latch first to go in it's gonna be the 1911 the FNP 9 to backup mags the Glock 19 to more backup everybody needs a decent pocket knife three spare thirty round mags five five six lock it all up that's how we do it here tactical walls tint there's nothing down here it's perfectly smooth but you can hear the lock open we've gone ahead and added ball bearing drawer slides for a smooth operation up and down we've also cleaned up the inside for a much cleaner presentation of these storage

make sure you share like and subscribe to my channel if you're not a fan already but I'll see you on the next video", "Doyqp5Ue6XY": "okay so I just started the rinsing process and we have already found another piece of surface gold I never get sick of seeing this another piece of surface gold just staring at me right in the face  there is no Wi-Fi out here but I promise you you will find a better connection good morning or good afternoon everybody welcome to the channel if you are new to it my name is Pauly your host here today we are exploring my brand new claim now I notice there's a lot of bedrock on this claim so I think the best thing to do for our first day is to really just do some crevice thing now my first day I just main first day bringing you guys along I was here just the other day working on this crevice here but I could not remove this but now I actually have a tool that will actually move this big piece of bedrock so first thing we're gonna do is just finish this crevice that I got started the other day and then when we're done this and we're satisfied with it we're gonna move on and see what else we can find  okay so I got this little chunk out now for the rest all right just removed all the overburden bedrock in the center of this crevice now it's just a matter of scooping it all out see what kind of gold we get and that will determine whether we stick to this line or we move on so right as I turn off the camera I noticed our first piece of exposed candy that's a good sign that there's gold around now I obviously know that there's gold here I mean this is why I'm coming back to the spot but it's just best to clean out a spot when you start working it so here we are let's continue I just coming up that piece I saw or not  first little pan microdots that you probably can't see on to the next  all right second pan and we're looking much better we have one little chunky piece that you could probably see and a whole bunch of little micros however there are too little wiry looking pieces in there which I do like so let's stay on this trend and hopefully continue to find more candy we are slowly making progress I still have a little bit more to move right here and once that's done I'll get this all wet hopefully find more exposed cracks that I can actually break open and get to the real bottom of the bedrock and then hopefully we'll be able to use my little sucker tool over there and suck out everything yes yes look at all that breaking bedrock gold will hide in Breaking Bad Rock looking good so I just did another pan and of course I wasn't filming it but check this out Oh Oh what do we have here yes look at that we have a nice piece of gold I would consider that a picker and a bunch of little bits of gold and we're not even at the very bottom yet so next thing to do is obviously just finish cleaning out all this dirtiness and then now we're gonna fill it full of water suck it out and then we'll see what we get  so there is a lot more material than I thought there would be so what I'm going to do is pan this down till there's only a little bit of material left and then I'm going to go back get more dirt and then add to that pan and just so keep repeating that process until we have one pan left and then hopefully we will do one reveal of maybe a lot of gold who knows  next pan oh geez  ok so it's been about 15 minutes and as you can see there's still more material to pan out and I've done about five pans and I couldn't resist it I did a little peek and check that out two pieces of visible gold so we know we're doing the right thing now it's just a matter of continuing this process I think I have one maybe two more pans left then I'll soak it rinse it suck it out and then we'll do hopefully an even better reveal  okay so I just started the rinsing process and we've already found another piece of surface gold I never get sick of seeing this another piece of surface gold just staring at me right in the face again it you when you see this you just never get sick of it that is really cool okay let's pick it up with some tweezers because it's a lot more fun to do it this way my other camera set up okay oh nice hopefully my other camera is focusing on this hoop that is a nice little flat piece of gold and a stick with it sweet so before I forget I'm gonna put that piece of gold and the snuffle and I'm just going to quickly rinse a little more just to see if we're not missing anything else  I love doing that I don't see anything all right we'll get to scraping and then second now before I continue this crevice I just wanted to quickly take this opportunity to announce something some of you out there have been asking me if there's a way to further support pioneer Pauley and there wasn't for the longest time I just don't like to accept anything to be honest but now there is I set up a temporary line of Pioneer poly merchandise which includes the logo that I usually wear it but I didn't didn't wear it today and then some other random stuff that you may find funny so now you can further support the channel and plus you can get something out of it for you or even a friend okay because I'm impatient I'm just going to pan this out right now which is about seven or eight pans of concentrated material and then we'll use a sucker tool to finish it all  Plus dick  all right almost really  hey I can see ya okay can I turn you around okay okay okay let's see yeah it's hard to do this with one hand we do have gold showing up I'm so bad at this yay okay I got to do a better job one sec all right just getting rid of a little bit more material to make this one hand pan man guy do a better job oh my gosh there we go so all over the place but there you have it some candy that's not tea bag seven or eight pans cool now let's suck out the rest here's a better shot for you guys I thought I'd try a little bit harder we have a little piece of wire in there to show that sweet okay time to sucker out  so I cleaned out this crevice the best I could with my sucker tube now I can't really get the very very very very very bottom of this crevice because the sucker tube just doesn't allow it doesn't go deep enough so I used my it's not for bottle to kind of suck up the areas that I missed filled up the bucket a little bit better and now it's time to cross her fingers and see what we get  there's not a lot of material in there but hopefully will be a lot of gold  and your nuggets trapped in this crossfire no no one  all right we're getting close  a little closer no gold yet hope some tiny bits okay alright that is awesome okay I'm gonna grab the grab the camera so this is kind of awkward because I'm kind of hold a pan over my mic so doesn't get wet but there is clearly gold there that is really cool I love seeing these little bits that you can kind of pick up well I can pick that one up that's cool so I'm noticing all the fine gold is disappearing the deeper I go which is a good sign because that means you're going to the bigger gold I was trying to be educational but the deeper you go the more closer you are to the bedrock the better gold you will find so with that kind of color it's gonna be really hard just to leave this so for more reassurance I dumped out my snuffer bottle and yeah with that kind of color I'm not just gonna walk away from this I'm now obligated to dig as deep as I can because who knows you you could find a nugget just crammed in the very bottom I am noticing a little bit more cracks in here too so I'm just gonna stick to this and hopefully find more all right so here we go again I broke up more bedrock that's all the material that I was able to remove sucked up a bit more and yeah we're gonna go pan this but my buddy Jimbo over there just found his first picker so I just congratulated him on social media wonderful alright let's pan this out I'm gonna be very quick with this I hate that I'm gonna be very quick with this because it's starting to rain again and I just want to put my camera away  why bedrock lot of sharp bloodthirsty bedrock well there's a little bit of gold but a couple specs in there okay I'll do a better clean up for you guys okay so not as good as I thought it would be but that's where the flower gold was okay so we're calling it a day today we've been here for about eight hours now and it's starting to rain pretty hard so let's hurry up go home check out the gold and do a little dance  so that wasn't a bad day at all I was honestly hoping to find a big nugget in there but you can't get them every time but maybe coming up when we scuba dive that waterfall from my last video we will find the mother lode anyways this is a loot that we found today yes no complaints here I left the city got in touch with nature and returned with some jewelry now here's a photo of Jimbo's take for the day he is quite happy and I'm happy he left me with an unfinished crevasse to work next time so let's just weigh the gold and talk about how much time I wasted I'd like to start off by weighing that one biggest piece that I have in there point one eight grams all right that's not too bad now for the rest of this stuff  come on five ounces point 72 grams so less than 50 bucks anyways that is it for this video if you enjoyed it please let me know by leaving a like just like comment or even subscribing social media is open to it for those of you interested to see anything else extra and if you wish to take your support a little bit further I have limited edition merchandise now

Oh, boy, came in for a $20  oil change.  >> You're about to see a fast  lube franchise pull a fast  one.  >> If you can, try and get  your transmission fluid  changed.  >> Is it necessary?  >> No, I just did a  transmission service.  >> Tom: That's what I thought.  We go up on the hoist  to show you what's really going  down at these oil change shops.  >> Let me tell you a little  bit about fraud.  >> Tom: Insiders share the  secrets of shaking you down.  >> I've never worked for a  more shady, crooked, deceitful  company.  >> Tom: And we track down the  man behind all this greasy  business.  >> That's him right by the door.  Do you want to just go get  him, Tom?  >> Yeah.  >> Just go, just go.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: We're heading to this  Economy Lube in Guelph,  Ontario.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: It's part of a chain of  oil change garages that  promises fast and affordable  service.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Ten minutes, 20 bucks,  and you're done, according to  their ad.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  \u00e2\u2122\u00aa Just $19.99, at Economy Lube\u00e2\u2122\u00aa  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Catchy but maybe not  that simple.  >> Hi there.  >> Need an oil change?  >> Yes, please.  >> Tom: Who hasn't worried  about turning over their car  to some gearhead and getting  back a big bill.  And a lot of gobbledygook.  >> Tom: We've been hearing  there's reason to worry at  Economy Lube.  That's why we're putting it to  the test.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Right off the bat,  they're upselling that $20 oil  change.  >> Tom: Recommending a more  expensive package than  advertised but does it get any  worse than that?  These guys say you can bet on  it.  >> I have never worked for a  company like Economy Lube, for  a more shady, crooked,  deceitful company.  >> Tom: They're insiders,  former employees of Economy  Lube, who still have ties to  the industry, and don't want  to be identified.  >> I totally rip people off  and I did that for a number of  years for the dollar and the  money.  >> Tom: Their years of ripping  people off at Economy Lube  ended in a bitter fight over  wages.  You had issues, you went to  the labour department and  argued over money, that sort  of thing.  >> Everything we're saying  is a hundred percent true.  There would be many more  people besides us that would  be, you know, willing to say  so as well.  >> Tom: They have no axe to  grind, they say, just a  conscience to clear.  >> This is our chance to right  our wrongs and bring awareness  to what's going on.  >> Tom: So they're blowing the  whistle on a company that they  say tops you up and rips you  off, all because the boss wants  it that way.  >> I couldn't remember  questioning him about the  practises as far as sales go,  and his exact words were go  save the whales somewhere  else, and he told me it was an  upsell world.  >> Tom: But we're not just  talking their word for it.  We've assembled a team of  testers to help us see for  ourselves.  All of them work for CBC.  Anu, Steve, and Ryan.  Each driving a car with one  thing in common: They all need  an oil change, and nothing  else.  They will be heading to that  same Economy Lube in Guelph.  And what's about to happen has  lessons for us all.  Our home base for the day is  Conestoga college.  They train a lot of future  mechanics here, and they have  agreed to let us use their  massive garage.  >> Tom: Morning everybody.  Nice to see you.  So the plan as you know is  we're going to head down to  Economy Lube and you're going  to just be customers.  >> Tom: Helping us with our  test is expert Mark  Sach-Anderson.  >> They shouldn't be offering  you anymore than just the oil  change you're going in for.  Everything else is fine on the  car so it should be a nice  simple, easy, in, oil change,  and out.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Mark has been in the  industry for more than 20  years.  He began as an oil change  technician himself.  Became a mechanic and worked  his way up the ranks.  He now runs this garage in  Toronto's west end.  >> There are a lot of good oil  change facilities.  Unfortunately, there's a few  bad ones, and it spoils it for  everybody.  >> Tom: The oil change industry  knows it has a bad reputation.  >> It seems like mechanics are  always out to get you.  >> Tom: Jiffy Lube, for  instance, plays off customer  worries in this ad.  >> But at Jiffy Lube, we don't  fix vehicles, we help keep them  running right to help you leave  repair shop worries behind.  >> Tom: So if the industry  knows we're suspicious, can we  really finally leave worries  behind?  If only.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: To do our test properly,  it's important to establish a  base line.  So Mark spends days going over  test vehicles.  He knows the kind of  additional services routinely  offered by places like Economy  Lube, such as fluid and filter  changes, and he wants to beat  them to the punch.  He makes sure none of our cars  need anything more than an oil  change.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Our hidden camera  specialist. Rob, is hard at  work making sure we've got all  the angles covered when it  comes to capturing our test.  >> Tom: Cool.  And where is that going to go?  >> Under the hood of the  Uplander.  >> So the guy working under  the hood, we'll be able to  see his hands working.  >> We'll be able to see his  hands reaching to all the  different -- stick and engine  coolant.  >> Cool.  >> Tom: So wondering what to  expect?  Back at Conestoga college, our  first tester, Anu, is wired up  and ready to go to see if what  we're hearing about Economy  Lube holds true.  >> I'll open the door for you.  >> Okay, thank you.  >> All right, good luck.  >> Thanks, Tom.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: The Economy Lube shop  is less than five minutes down  the road from our home base.  As Anu approaches, our  surveillance camera across the  street picks her up and  follows her in.  Our insiders say at Economy  Lube, the technicians count on  your ignorance, even though  they might not know much more  about your car than you do.  >> When I started, I'd never  worked on vehicles, never  popped a drain plug, never did  an oil change, no experience.  >> Tom: How about you?  >> I had experience from a  previous oil change places but  I worked with people who  didn't know anything about  cars at all.  >> Tom: They soon learn the  way things work at Economy  Lube.  Who trained you?  >> Actually, the owner of the  company Steve Moxey.  >> Tom: And what did he teach  you?  >> How to sell all the  different services, upselling.  >> Tom: What did that mean at  Economy Lube?  >> To sell as many services  and get as big of a bill as  you possibly could on every  single vehicle.  >> Because he didn't care if  you did the work, he cared if  you got the money.  >> Tom: And were these services  that were needed?  >> Uh, majority of the time, no.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: You can find a photo  of owner Steve Moxey right on  the door as you enter Economy  Lube.  Moxey has built a chain of 12  shops throughout southwestern  Ontario.  And according to our insiders,  he's done it through  dishonesty.  >> Just need an oil change?  >> Yeah.  >> Tom: Inside the shop, our  first tester is hearing she  needs a lot more than a simple  oil change.  >> Couldn't have smelled burnt  and it certainly wasn't brown  because I changed it.  >> Tom: And later, a former  fraud cop weighs in on our  findings.  >> I have told people all my  life that fraud is theft with  a smile.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: We're inside a quick  oil change shop called Economy  Lube.  Like all these types of shops,  they say they specialize in  fast work at affordable  prices.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Insiders tell us they  do a lot more than that.  Like sell you services you  don't need.  >> Engine flush.  >> Tom: Charge whatever they  can get and often not even do  the work.  >> Gimme some examples of  where you might do something  that wasn't really the real  thing?  >> One of the easiest things  to sell is power steering  fluid.  Take a sample and you can tell  a person that it should be  clear, you could tell a person  that it should be red, or you  could just go by the smell of  the fluid, smell this, the  fluid is very burnt.  There's a very easy sale.  >> Tom: With each lie they  tell, technicians earn money.  >> They were on a commission  system as far as what you  sold, so if I sold, say, a  coolant flush for $59, I would  get $2, if I sold it for 69  bucks, I get three bucks.  >> Tom: The bigger the lie,  the more money.  That's why they do so much  lying.  How often would those things  happen where you do a trick  every day.  >> Every day.  >> Multiple times a day.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: So will it happen to  our first tester?  Anu's car has been up on the  hoist for a few short minutes.  When she gets the prognosis.  >> Most of your stuff is in  good shape.  >> Okay.  >> Tom: The car needs more  than an oil change, he says,  it needs a brake flush and  power steering flush, two  procedures that involve time  and the complete replacement  of fluids.  But why?  >> Tom: Burning fluid.  Just like our insiders talked  about.  >> Tom: Remember, our expert  mechanic has checked out this  car and assures us it needs no  such work.  But in keeping with our test,  we give the go-ahead.  >> Tom: In reality it takes  them half that time.  In less than eight minutes, we  get the bill.  >> Tom: More than 200 bucks?  How did that happen?  >> Tom: We push for a better  explanation and get a better  deal in the process.  >> Tom: Our tester pays up.  And heads back to home base.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: So how did it go?  >> You know what?  They were really nice.  >> Tom: Can we see the bill?  >> Yeah, sure.  >> Tom: Nice is nice but our  expert mechanic Mark Sach-  Anderson says there's nothing  nice about that final bill.  In your view, the power  steering flush and brake fluid  flush were not needed?  >> No.  The fluids were up.  All of this was checked when I  had it at my shop.  Not three days ago.  >> Tom: Not only was the work  not needed, Mark suspects it  wasn't done.  Given how little time it took.  Mark shows us the four points  behind the wheels where it  would be clear if a brake  flush had been carried out.  >> There's so much rust on the  back of this bleeder or on the  bleeder here, and around the  seal, it hasn't been opened.  That tells me that the system's  not flushed.  >> Tom: All right, Mark,  let's go to the videotape, shall  we, and see what they did.  Our videotape confirms Mark's  suspicions.  >> Tightening the filter,  wiping off any oil.  >> Tom: That $90 brake flush  never happened.  >> Tom: Still nothing on the  brakes.  >> Nothing on the brakes.  >> Tom: Same for the power  steering flush.  Our hidden hood cam shows no  evidence it was performed.  >> But reality is you were  charged for it.  And it wasn't done.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Time for test number  two.  Our man Ryan is pulling up for  his oil change.  And who knows what else.  >> I'm here for the engine oil  change.  >> Yeah, no problem.  >> Tom: Just like last time,  that $20 oil change they  advertise becomes 29.  >> Tom: And just like last  time, it doesn't end there.  After a quick inspection, they  tell Ryan he needs more than  his oil change.  >> Tom: The brakes, again,  and the transmission?  Our expert, Mark, just did that  a few days ago.  A messy and lengthy procedure  we captured on camera.  Our insiders tell us this kind  of deception can really add  up.  >> As much as you didn't want  to do it but at the end of the  week when you get a thousand  dollar paycheque take home.  >> The money was just too  good.  With a high school education,  where are you going to make  between 65 and $100,000  a year?  >> Tom: Now Ryan is handing over  his money at Economy Lube.  After just ten minutes of work  on his car.  >> Tom: On his way with some  air fresheners and a bill that  stinks.  >> Thank you, bye.  >> Tom: Back at home base, we  have a look.  How was it?  >> It was, yeah, pricey.  >> Tom: We'll see what you  came up with.  218.  >> Yeah.  >> Tom: You asked for a $20  oil change?  >> Right, yeah, I did.  >> Tom: $218, Ryan's bill is  ten times when he went in for,  including 80 bucks for the  transmission.  Was that needed?  >> No.  I just, just did a transmission  service on this.  >> Tom: That's what I thought.  We check our hidden camera  tape to see how they sell that  one.  >> Tom: There's that burning  fluid line again.  Our expert is appalled.  >> It did not smelled burned  because it was all fresh fluid.  But I mean there's absolutely  no way that this service was  needed.  Good sales pitch.  But it's completely false.  It's almost like a script,  it's almost identical to the  service that we had on car  number one, the same it's  dirty, it smells.  >> Tom: So how about that  expensive brake flush?  They didn't actually do it the  first time they charged for  it, how about this time?  Mark checks and says no.  They didn't do a flush?  >> They couldn't have done a  flush.  >> Tom: Two for two.  Two flushes paid for that  didn't happen.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: Our third and final  tester Steve pulls in towards  the end of the day to get  his oil changed.  But will the upsell happen  again?  The answer comes minutes  later.  >> Tom: The technician promises  to flush out the entire engine  block and the radiator, and of  course, the braking system.  Back at home base...  >> Tom: How was it?  >> That was the most expensive  $19.99 I ever spent.  >> Tom: Really?  >> Oh, yeah.  >> Tom: Let's see.  251 bucks?  Good Lord, that's the highest  of the day.  What was the sales pressure  like on you?  >> They start off sounding  like you can choose, but they  sort of -- they gradually move  it into you really should get  it, we can do it for you right  now.  >> Tom: But did they do it?  Mark is interested in the full  system coolant flush they  charged for.  He says this car uses a  special coolant called  dex-cool which is orange.  He shows us what's in the  resevoir.  >> Look at that, bright green.  >> Tom: Bright green.  That's not the proper coolant?  >> That's not the proper  coolant for this vehicle.  >> Tom: Is what's in there in  here?  >> We don't know that.  >> Tom: Mark wants to take a  sample from the radiator.  He says if an actual flush was  done, the fluid coming out  will also be green.  >> That looks orange to me.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Okay.  So that's coming out of the  radiator.  >> Tom: Right.  >> That is what is throughout  the system.  What we've seen changed here  is the stuff in the resevoir  and it's been changed with the  wrong stuff.  >> Tom: And what does that  mean for the vehicle?  >> It can cause damage to the  sensors, it can cause damage  and premature wear inside the  engine.  We should really be pulling  that stuff out of the resevoir  before it causes problems.  >> Tom: So not only was the  coolant publish not needed, it  was not done right, causing  cross contamination which  means we have to fix it.  And yet we paid $250.  What do you think about what  they've done?  >> Certainly not right.  Certainly gives us in the  industry a bad name.  >> And it's certainly time to  get some answers.  >> Tom: Oh.  >> What?  >> Tom: He's coming.  So after the break, we show up  at Economy Lube's warehouse  uninvited.  Mr. Moxey, Tom Harrington from  \"Marketplace.\"  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa) >> Tom: Our investigation into  oil change shops run by  Economy Lube takes us to a  former investigator himself.  >> Let me tell you a little  bit about fraud.  >> Tom: Mark Simchison used to  lead the major fraud division  of the Hamilton police.  at Economy Lube. we were sold  >> Tom: And what our expert  mechanic discovered.  >> It hasn't been opened.  That tells me that the  system's not flushed.  >> Tom: So what's his verdict?  >> I have told people all my  life that fraud is theft with  a smile.  >> Tom: Putting it right out  there, you're saying what  they're doing is fraud?  >> If they are charging for,  and accepting, money for and  receiving money for services  that they did not perform that  you paid for in all honesty,  that's fraud.  >> Tom: And that's exactly  what we found.  Time to take our evidence to  the top.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: We're as close to the  lot as we can possibly be so  we can see the door.  We're outside Economy Lube  warehouse in Cambridge,  Ontario.  >> He's in the car sitting.  >> Tom: Is he really?  >> Yeah.  >> Tom: Looking for some  answers.  Okay, he's gone in.  We've already made repeated  requests for an on-camera  interview with president and  founder Steve Moxey.  He's now inside.  He backed in with his Range  Rover inside that closed door  garage door.  Given him weeks to think about  it.  >> So if he sees the camera,  I don't think he'll come to  the door.  >> Tom: Right.  More details when requested.  >> I don't know exactly how we  should proceed because we're  across the parking lot right  now.  -- But Moxey still won't come  on camera.  >> Tom: Oh.  >> What?  >> Tom: He's coming.  >> Do you want to go get him,  Tom?  >> Tom: Yeah, why don't we  try now.  So when we spot the man who  greases the wheels at Economy  Lube...  >> Okay here he comes, he's out.  Just go.  Just go.  >> Tom: We decide to roll.  Mr. Moxey.  But Steve Moxey --  Tom Harrington from  \"Marketplace.\"  -- doesn't want to talk about  why his company is ripping  people off.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: A few days later, we  reach Moxey by phone and  he denies any wrongdoing.  >> I have a real hard time  believing that you took three  cars in and not one of those  cars actually had the service  done because I'm in stores  every day.  You know, I could be wrong,  you know, it's a hundred  employees, anything's  possible.  If it's in fact the case, I  agree with anybody that that  is fraudulent.  >> Tom: We contact those  Economy Lube employees caught  by our hidden cameras.  This one denies working on any  of our test cars.  >> There you go, sir.  >> Tom: But the other fesses  up.  >> I'm not proud of it, but  that's how we were taught to  do stuff.  In that company, you are  forced to rip people off  basically because all the  owner's looking for is money.  If he's not making money, then  you're no use to him.  (\u00e2\u2122\u00aa\u00e2\u2122\u00aa)  >> Tom: As for lessons learned  in all this.  Here's a few tips from our  \"Marketplace\" survival guide  the next time you need an oil  change.  Familiarize yourself with the  service schedule recommended  by your car's manufacturer.  They built your car, and  probably know best when it  needs maintenance.  Quick oil change shops are  fine for a quick oil change.  For anything bigger or  unexpected, stick with a  mechanic you know you can  trust.  And finally, be on your toes  and know an upsell is coming.  That way you won't be caught  offguard by any greasy  business.

gonna say go to a company that makes tanks but if I have an idea for a hover tank or an invisible tank and I can show a reasonable scientific plan to get to that end goal DARPA is the one who's gonna fund that  DARPA has granted National Geographic filmmakers unprecedented access to closely guarded labs remote proving grounds and underwater test areas at DARPA headquarters we surrender our cell phones at the visitor control center edge of edge then we are escorted to the only room where interviews can be conducted sometimes our questions hit a brick wall you know I don't go down that road the security reason don't want to tell you the secret sauce um yeah can i no talk about that let's not talk about that fun for now from developing ways to spot hidden threats in Iraq to designing hypersonic jets that can fly more than five times the speed of sound DARPA tackles what they called DARPA hard problems a problem it's really difficult you just say that's too hard to do and if you if you answer the question like that then it's a DARPA heart problem the highest risk possible is when you put resources on something and you have no idea whether it's going to happen those are DARPA heart problems the problems that are too hard to solve DARPA hard we kill them the world faces a new kind of terror that has transformed the nature of combat America's war fighters have an urgent need for new weapons and defenses to fight a hidden enemy whose attacks are unexpected and deadly case in point how to defend our troops against rocket-propelled grenades in Iraq RPGs are a leading cause of combat death they are cheap to make fast RPGs can be fired from anywhere and raced to their targets in seconds a seemingly unstoppable threat DARPA solution a revolutionary technology called Iron Curtain Iron Curtain was developed to protect lives lives of people in armored vehicles lion armored vehicles against threats such as rocket pelegrin aids many RPGs are so powerful they can penetrate a concrete wall or a foot of solid steel it takes an RPG about a tenth of a second to travel 15 yards to its target DARPA steam has to develop something fast and powerful enough to detect track and destroy it in a split second just inches from the vehicle itself but can it be done  at a remote site on the Utah Salt Flats scientists prepare to test the iron curtain system on an armored Humvee it's about to be subjected to an attack by simulated RPG fire as the RPG is flying in the first sensor that sees it is the radar this is the radar antenna so they can track the RPG as it comes in the second sensor that sees it is there's all along here there's an optical sensor and as the RPG flies underneath we're able to select at the exact aim point the countermeasure then has an effect on the exact point that you want it to now since we can't have explosive countermeasures on the test that we're doing out here today we use instead a system that we call the diode gun and we set the lights in sequence so that they travel down at the exact same speed that the countermeasure would be going so we can see then with the high-speed camera that's operating at about 30,000 frames per second we can see precisely where the countermeasure would have hit the RPG today's test will require pinpoint radar detection of the incoming threat and an instant trigger of the countermeasure system before the test the equipment must be calibrated they aim the air cannon precisely using a laser okay that's good a little bit to the right that looks good  we have an autonomous system that's GPS guided the guide system around the track so that we can conduct our experiments completely unmanned in three two one go  [Music]  all right let's watch the high-speed only by examining the data can technicians tell if Iron Curtain worked in the critical time frame required footage shot by their high-speed camera indicates that the sensors detected the incoming RPG threat the countermeasures would have effectively been deployed in time to stop the RPG in about 1/10 of a second [Music]  the Utah test of the iron curtain system using simulated RPGs is a success but can Iron Curtain stop deadly live RPG fire in the case of Iron Curtain we have had several occasions where the system didn't work as planned and the RPG did go high order and destroyed all of our apparatus and you just pick up the pieces in this case literally pick up the pieces and you push on in June 2008 the iron curtain system is tested again with live fire we had a lot of confidence in the system although I won't say that my heart wasn't up here we took a shot we detected with the radar the optical system went on told our countermeasure where to shoot we shot it held our breath  and sure enough we've done at the RPG when over wiped the RDX that explosive off the vehicle and congratulate ourselves and on that particular Humvee we only had 3/8 inch armor which is as much and we shot five RPGs at it so you can see impact points of five RPGs on that vehicle and we've obviously we doubted them all we still have our vehicle what exactly is the countermeasure dropping to disable the RPG that remains DARPA secret and behind-the-scenes DARPA found a way to give our warfighters a futuristic helping hand on patrol in Iraq America's soldiers can fall prey to sniper fire to shield themselves our war fighters must rely on 30 pounds of body armor for protection with the rest of their gear they must shoulder as much as 125 pounds to give them the extra strength they need DARPA goes to a place where fact meets science fiction scientist Steve Jacobson at raytheon-sarcos and is working to create a new breed of soldier with superhuman powers his creation the exoskeleton combines a man and a machine to offer extraordinary strength if you put 200 pounds of body armor on somebody right now they're gonna walk about 300 feet if you put 200 pounds of body armor on somebody wear an exoskeleton they can walk all day the exoskeleton mirrors the human body a computer network serves as its nervous system hydraulic valves and actuators function as muscles and its skeleton is made of aluminum the challenge of putting a person inside a machine is a daunting one know when you put a machine around person there's all sorts of places where it interferes with an emotion it may have braids your skin when you first put it on and it's not powered up it feels very heavy because you're wearing a 200 pound robot which is a lot of weight already to power up power up as soon as they power it up all that weight goes away and suddenly you feel like  Rex Jamison where's what it's probably the most advanced design currently being tested by a human operator the risk is that it's extraordinarily fast and extraordinarily strong so if it decides to do something you know I can't fight it the exoskeleton is designed to amplify the operators movement without blocking it to read his motion enhance it and make him stronger the superhuman stamina of the exoskeleton makes it a priceless military asset it will allow a soldier to lift 100 pounds with no more effort than lifting 10 when I'm lifting heavy things with the exoskeleton it's surprising you look at the object in your brain thinks you can't pick that up you don't feel any stronger than exascale them but then then you reach out and pick it up and there's no effort at all and it continually surprises me it feels like I'm looking a problem how much load are you filling it pulling 200 pounds moving things is one of the large forgotten jobs in the military and the exoskeleton is designed to help an individual soldier move boxes all day long without getting tired 35 pound ammunition can you know a normal man can lift without much problem but after lifting 20 of them they're gonna get really tired and it requires no effort on my part so I could do it forever basically  by reducing fatigue the exoskeleton can enhance the combat performance of the warfighter and the exoskeleton is more than strong it's light on its feet the fun part for me about operating excellent are the speakers like a punching bag and the soccer ball it's very quick and very precise and surprising given how much power it has how I can follow you so quickly the exoskeleton is the best robot in the world right now because there's no other robot in the world that you can climb in to move really do work and not get tired one of the joys of the exoskeleton is watching someone's face who sees it for the first time because to them this has been science fiction but all of a sudden science fiction is real they see a machine on a person and they know tomorrow's here the army is adapting the exoskeleton for supply handling to help our troops bear the burdens of war but strength and stamina are not enough a war fighters survival depends on locating the enemy a new DARPA breakthrough answers that need  for our troops survival means spotting an enemy sniper on a rooftop before he spots you when Iraq started it was very clear in the urban area and that what people really wanted was surveillance but they didn't want from ten miles away they just wanted to know what was on the next block DARPA solution the wasp it's no bigger than a toy but looks can be deceiving the thing I think that makes wasps so unique is it has all the same features that are found in a full-size airplane it has an altimeter it has a gyro it has GPS it has a magnetometer all of these things that are found in full-size airplanes are found in a package less than 26 inches and weighs at less than a pound each stage or block of the wasp produced by the Aero vironment corporation was supervised by DARPA program manager Leo Christodoulou this is the block 3 production aircraft this aircraft has multiple capability with modular payloads such as this one which is a high-resolution camera but he could also have a night-vision camera or indeed he could have an extra battery to give it increased endurance think of it as airborne binoculars for the infantry it has the capability to accomplish complex missions with high degree of autonomy in cases where it loses communication and has no instructions you will go to a rally point it will go to a specific location in wait for you there the wasp has already proved effective on covert combat missions where it can be used to help detect snipers or terrorist hideouts one of the key design objectives of the wasp was the ability for a single warfighter to quickly efficiently and easily assemble it and fly in in very short order what I have in the backpack here is a micro air vehicle that a single man can operate here's the air vehicle itself  this is a night camera and this is the camera we use for flying in the day this is the controller I use to view the video and control the aircraft in Wilson flight and this is the RF unit which sends up the command to the aircraft and then receives video I'm here at a test range in California we're gonna send this armored vehicle somewhere out on the range way out there and I'm gonna find it with this  the target vehicle doesn't stop until it's far beyond his line-of-sight lost in the distance okay I've done the pre-flight system checks are good and we're gonna launch the vehicle and go find that guy powered by an electric motor the wasp block three can travel at a speed of up to 40 miles per hour it's capable of flying for forty-five minutes to a distance as far as three miles away from its operator so I'm looking down the road here yeah we're just seeing where he might have gone or look at the side left right and I'll just keep looking around I'm inside view camera here and I'm just looking to see if we can find him  there is there's the vehicle we were able to find the vehicle  even more surprising than how well the wasp flies is the way it lands when the wasp lands it's designed to break apart in order to absorb air and energy very much like a NASCAR is designed to break apart when they crash that's the way we design our UAVs such that when they break apart the energy of the door the piece parts may fall apart but then you can pick them up and you can put the airplane right back together again and it's ready to fly [Music] [Applause] [Music] not only was it darker hard technologically but he was DARPA fast in terms of getting it into the hands of the operators we needed to turn this aircraft into a robust tough little bird that could take everything that they were fighting my family with the wasp DARPA helps put the element of surprise on our side and surprise has always been part of DARPA DNA since a day that shook the world  DARPA was founded when one of our enemies took us by surprise 50 years ago we had Sputnik launched by the mother Russians which greatly surprised this country we never believed that they were going to get to space first tarp is primary mission from the very beginning this would be an agency whose job is to prevent technological surprise to the United States over the years we have found that the best way to prevent technological surprise is to create it so we have gone out and created surprise and in order to prevent it from happening to us DARPA gave America the high-tech edge with breakthroughs like the Saturn moon rocket that began as a DARPA program and stealth technology the reason you have a GPS receiver the reason you have cellphones so small because DARPA created the technology many years ago many other innovations that DARPA helped to pioneer from the computer mouse to the Internet have transformed our lives has been involved from the very beginning in enabling technologies if we could have a sticker it would say DARPA inside and and that sticker would go to every high-technology product there probably is DARPA is quest for advanced technology ratcheted up after the deadly attacks of 9/11 suddenly we faced a determined and elusive enemy who posed an unnerving new threat I actually worked in the Pentagon at the time and after 9/11 word came down that it was imperative that we had systems that could get places fast over long distances DARPA envisioned a game-changer that could fly over 4,000 miles per hour twice as fast as the fastest jet many times there's targets of opportunity and you have very little time to deal with those targets the system that can fly four thousand miles per hour from the continental United States has the ability to engage those targets in a very brief amount of time in less than two hours this extraordinary aircraft is fly 9,000 miles to carry a 12,000 pound payload to the enemy  but is such a revolutionary aircraft even possible to find out DARPA chose as one of its partners Lockheed Martin a company that has developed many secret aircraft including the u-2 spy plane and the sr-71 blackbird first aircraft to fly over 2,000 miles per hour their facility called skunk works is famous for its innovation and also for its secrecy the access we're offering here today is really unprecedented this facility has well over a million square feet in just a few windows the reason for that is we want to prevent physical access from people looking inside the windows but also to prevent sounds from being transmitted that sounds could oscillate through the windows and transmit classified or sensitive conversations occasionally we have security areas that require supplemental security protection in this case we have white noise being piped in to prevent classified or highly sensitive discussions from being overheard by a casual passerby few discussions at skunkworks cover subjects as sensitive as this one a bold new aircraft concept design known as the HTV 3x Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne has the formidable challenge of developing the scramjet engine a scramjet is purely a supersonic combustion ramjet to put that in perspective it's almost like trying to keep match lit in a hurricane because the speed of the air blowing past it is in fact supersonic instead of being restricted to a launch pad like a missile the HTV 3x will have the game-changing capability to take off and land from any regular runway offering strategic flexibility in a national emergency to take off and land safely on runways calls for a relatively large wing but to fly at very high speeds demands a much smaller wing can we make the control services larger how to create one aircraft to do both poses a double edge design problem we recently returned from the Lockheed Martin low-speed wind tunnel where we tested our low speed aerodynamics for the HTV 3x low speed testing for the falcon program is part of making Falcon an airplane as opposed to a missile an aircraft must take off and land gracefully which means it must fly at low speeds to use existing runways and so therefore low-speed testing of these high-speed configurations is critical let's get back together two days and let's see what we got we bought from there the details of the Falcon project remain a closely guarded secret and DARPA scientists intend to keep them that way [Music] while DARPA enhances our potential for hypersonic flight they also set their sights on helping our combat swimmers these war fighters often swim long distances to shore before entering combat and risk arriving too exhausted to safely complete their mission in the animal world there are some extremely efficient swimmers and we started looking at those animals to learn how they swim and see if we can transfer the methods that they use over to people this is a pretty close copy of a penguin way elliptical in profile it was actually a failure didn't work at all in this case this wing is very similar to what you'd find on the back of a whale on his tail very efficient very hard to manufacture so we actually designed it out finally this wing has the aspect ratio of the whale's tail wing without the bumps on the front this is our finished wing our finished product here is something easy to produce but performs just as well as a nature inspired wing  the resulting device called power swim harnesses human muscle for swimming as never before with swim fins a combat swimmer burns 400 calories an hour but with power swim he burns less than 100 DARPA program manager J Lowell shows how the power swim device operates the way this works is you buckle this into your leg you have these Springs that help maintain the angle of attack of the wing appropriately in this back stabilizer foil which gives your use something to kind of push against with your lower part of your leg and you're essentially going to bend your knees and drive this spar away from and towards your body when you're doing that the foils are catching the water it propels the whole device forward at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland J Lowell has set up a speed comparison test a diver using power swim against a barefoot diver and one with swim fins the three swimmers move into position for the race an underwater signal serves as the starting button like a shot is taken from the start  the diver with power swim finishes first the one with swim fins is left behind and the barefoot one isn't even close the reason we feel that the power swim device is a very significant advance that perhaps the most significant propulsion advance since the swim fin is that we've managed to improve the efficiency of that diver from 10 percent to 75 percent efficient anything that we can give the Marine that will get him to shore 50% faster while we're reducing his workload 50 percent is going to ensure that he is completely mission capable when he reaches that shore power swim allows combat divers to swim up to twice as fast and four or five times farther than before without getting tired it means they can be dropped off at greater distances from shore so they're less likely to be detected by the enemy but this creates another problem because they're farther out at sea combat swimmers face a higher risk of getting lost and it's imperative they know exactly where they are at all times to solve this new DARPA hard problem the agency developed another breakthrough the tactical underwater navigation system or tons the tons unit combines an advanced compass and depth gauge with a state-of-the-art sonar system giving the warfighter his exact position at all times  the thing that's nice about DARPA is is there's no limits to what you can try the sky's the limit and no idea is a stupid idea and so all that does is set all these projects up for success in the long run because they listen to everybody DARPA innovations enable our combat swimmers to steer a safe course through hostile waters and in Iraq DARPA is helping our war fighters to face their deadliest threat improvised explosive devices or IEDs have killed over 1,700 Americans and wounded many more they can be buried by the side of the road hidden in ordinary objects and triggered by cellphones IEDs pose an invisible and ever-present danger  the DARPA heart problem locate these explosive devices without setting foot inside the deadly blast radius DARPA solution the math for micro air vehicle when the Mavs successful flight test was first publicized I got a call from a warfighter currently deployed who said we need that now the MAV was developed to have a unique hover and stair capability they really needed something that would allow them to see over the next hill or around the next corner the ability to go to a target area and persistently stare at that area and give them situational awareness weighing only four pounds the Mavs remarkable motor delivers as much power as a 25 pound lawnmower engine and literally sucks the MAV through the air air is sucked into that duct by this fan that's creating the aerodynamic lift the ducted fan air vehicle configuration provides vertical flight capability plus it has no exposed moving parts for safety around soldiers Marines and airmen it can actually fly backwards forwards anything it needs to do to compensate for the wind and to put its sensor on on its target the MAV sensors include a camera that can detect and recognize man-sized targets at more than 800 feet in daylight and more than 400 feet at ninth but today Honeywell program manager Vaughn Fulton and his team will determine whether the MAV can locate a much smaller target a concealed simulated ie D in a nearby control center technicians monitor the mass data  we're gonna simulate there's a suspicious device  [Music]  using its heat sensitive infrared camera the math can detect the temperature differential between the ground and an alien object in the dirt [Music]  they spot their target the mavs infrared camera detects what the naked eye the  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  man brings a game-changing technology to the battlefield something the enemy has not seen before and a capability they're not ready to combat our troops face another deadly threat and unlike IEDs this one's not man-made with temperatures in Iraq and Afghanistan that can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit sometimes the environment itself is the enemy thousands of our troops have suffered from heat exhaustion DARPA likes to support projects that will be game changers in other words give us a real advantage and if you talk to any soldier who has been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan you ask them what is the major limiting factor for their activities over there they'll say heat heat can limit physical performance and hamper judgment and unless the body is quickly cooled heat stroke can lead to brain damage or death at a Stanford University lab scientists dennis grande and craig heller have developed a remarkable breakthrough we have to be able to run experiments under realistic conditions we're not in Iraq so we have a hot room and then we simulate battle conditions by the clothing that is worn a biological chemical warfare suit heavily insulated for protection offers the worst case scenario for overheating in battle now what this is is going to be a device that will measure your body temperature at the level of your heart because all blood coming back from all regions of the body comes to the heart so that's the best integrated temperature of your body so when you get this all the way up your nose the end of it is going to be right at the level of your heart and for good measure how about a helmet okay so now we're gonna go into the hot room and hot room is at 42 centigrade that's about a hundred and eight Fahrenheit so a nice cool day in the desert okay Steve we use the treadmill here on the Left treadmill up to a 13% grade now pretty good workout well we have Steve exercising in the heat and we're leave him in there exercising until his core temperature gets up to 39 degrees that's about a hundred and two Fahrenheit so would represent a healthy fever  when his core temperature reaches 102 degrees Fahrenheit he is even more heavily insulated okay Steve we've now simulated a full biological chemical warfare gear by insulating your hands which would normally be covered with gloves your face and head which would be covered by gas masks goggles helmet and your feet which would be covered by boots how do you feel miserable huh Steve is left to rest in the hot room but his temperature still hovers at a feverish 102 degrees Fahrenheit  okay Steve times up so let's let's make you feel a little bit better Craig will cool Steve off using a revolutionary device they call it the glove  the gloves are activated so now we can see how much heat we can actually suck out of your hands all right the cool water which is perf using this metal cylinder is going to take heat away from your hands the hot blood is coming into your hand it's being distributed in this big network of blood vessels just under the palm and that heats being transferred to the metal cone the cool blood is going right back to your heart and being distributed through the core of your body feels good even though he is heavily insulated as the cool water circulates through the glove Steve's temperature immediately starts to drop and will soon reach a safe level the glove that can protect warfighters from heatstroke can also save the lives of those suffering from extreme cold including combat swimmers who sometimes spend eight hours in freezing water to perform a mission [Music]  how are you feeling at this point feeling a little bit cold Dennis Kron is testing whether he can stop research assistant Tim Wolfe from shivering even in the chill of an ice bath that simulates the extreme cold a combat swimmer must survive let me see your hands here yeah you can feel they've pretty much closed down let's take a look at the palm on the infrared here your face is cooling off pretty well your nose definitely shut down can you reach over and feel your ears compared to this rest of the skin temperature and they're very much colder your core temperature is starting to fall down now and you can see it's a pretty decent decline so I think that it's about time to start putting some heat in and see what happens with that plane will that work for you the way we're gonna do it is stick your hand into this little device here that creates a slight negative pressure what that does is it draws blood into your hand and so you've got your arterial blood flow out through here being warmed up in these heat exchangers then going right back to your body core where it's circulating around and the heart delivers it to the core organs okay and you look on the infrared you can see little spots on your arms are starting to warm up like right there and your elbow region superficial veins are starting to light up as the warm blood returning to the heart is warming the tissues as it passes it only took about 30 seconds in a minute before I started to feel a lot more comfortable I feel a little cold still but I'm not sure right which is a good thing I think that this was a real situation and I was really stuck in cold water like this that these things will be a real lifesaver as dangerous as the physical stress of extreme environments is the mental stress of combat there too DARPA readies the warfighter to step into harm's way [Applause] to help our troops prevail in a second-by-second ordeal of combat DARPA experts have developed a remarkable innovation in mission rehearsal you're being transported out to the area on the way there you open up your laptop and now you see a full 3d recreation of the area you're going to be in you've never been there before it's been built up for actually accurate data so that when you land on on the ground it feels like you've already been there before the real world 3d simulation combines the latest satellite data ground photographs and drone footage for a depiction of the combat site so accurate the warfighter can rehearse his mission as never before just the ability to be able to travel the terrain in a mission set in a virtual environment is invaluable walking training never seen before has its own hazards but if I could have just the rehearsal of walking the terrain that's tremendous the real-world 3d simulation gives the warfighter an extra edge to avoid deadly surprises in combat  another critical operation for troops is intelligence gathering through surveillance missions but flying over enemy territory is extremely dangerous a recent DARPA breakthrough the a 160 can conduct surveillance at high altitude over long distances without placing a human life at risk the a 160 does not have a pilot in the traditional sense the people in the ground control station including myself have control over the bird through a data link where we give it air speed heading velocity commands the pilotless a 160 can hover at 20,000 feet and has set a world record for a helicopter of its size flying 18.7 hours without refueling a 160 is is clearly a game-changer its ability to take off and land vertically and it's very very long endure since high altitude operation gathers together a set of capabilities that no other aircraft has ever had before today at a secure landing field in Victorville California the a1 60 will be tested carrying a payload that is itself a breakthrough a radar system called Forrester the Foresters most impressive capability is the ability to see through a number of layers of tree foliage single double canopy will go through that like a hot knife through butter so any place where people can hide in foliage we can find today's flight test will assess whether the a 160 can safely rotate the massive forest or antenna can the a 160 deploy the antenna for radar detection at various angles without endangering its stability in flight the aircraft is towed into positions the technicians await the take-off command  shadowed by a chase helicopter the a 160 carrying the Forester antennae who climbs to its programmed altitude for the test to begin altitude 5000 feet can the pilotless aircraft remains stable as it deploys the radar antenna for the first time subjecting the aircraft to maximum torque it's time to find out  the radar antenna is deployed the test director delivers the official verdict the antenna was rotated a full plus minus 180 degrees and we flew the antenna out at 90 degrees as well so a lot of good data was captured today's flight completed a lot of the unknown territory and questions we had with the antenna installed on the a1 60 we're very very pleased with the performance the flight test determined that the a 160 could safely deploy the forrester antenna at any angle without endangering the aircraft stability the a 160 can be operated in the fully autonomous mode where we give it a mission plan and then it goes through and execute those commands with no input from the operator capable of flying complex missions without a pilot the a 160 can carry a thousand pound payload weapons supplies and more it has the potential to go in and perhaps rescue somebody from a situation that you wouldn't be able to get a person out of otherwise the aircraft could fly an autonomously perhaps get that person out and bring them back to safety no matter how complex the technology the a 160 like many DARPA innovations as a simple goal to save lives for 50 years no idea has been dismissed as impossible if it could protect America's war fighters and keep surprise on our side in the next 50 years the people who know DARPA secrets can only hint at the surprises to come there are many game changes that we're working on some are as as dramatic as having aircraft that stay up for five years what I see happening in the future is that you'll take precision bring it down with us to the level of a bullet where you actually guide a bullet through flight and change course to the target aircraft which which reconfigure themselves in flight they do it automatically perhaps little bird like they changed their winger configuration they can maneuver in ways that we've not done it in the past many of the things darker works on a classified so we can't tell you what they are but what I can tell you is many of those developments are gonna change our lives in the past 50 years among its many breakthroughs DARPA helps bring us the Internet GPS and stealth technology today in the high-stakes struggle between nations DARPA is still an agency with a mission to make sure that we reach the future first several occasions where the system didn't work as planned and the RPG did go high order and destroyed all of our apparatus and you just pick up the pieces in this case literally pick up the pieces and you push on in June 2008 the iron curtain system is tested again with live fire we had a lot of confidence in the system although I won't say that my heart wasn't up here we took a shot we detected with the radar the optical system went on told our countermeasure where to shoot we shot it held our breath  and sure enough we've done at the RPG when over wiped the RDX that explosive off the vehicle and congratulate ourselves and on that particular Humvee we only had 3/8 inch armor which isn't much and we shot five RPGs at it so you can see impact points of five RPGs on that vehicle and we've obviously we've done at the mall we still have our vehicle what exactly is the countermeasure dropping to disable the RPG that remains DARPA secret and behind the scenes DARPA found a way to give our warfighters a futuristic helping hand on patrol in Iraq America's soldiers can fall prey to sniper fire to shield themselves our warfighters must rely on 30 pounds of body armor for protection with the rest of their gear they must shoulder as much as 125 pounds to give them the extra strength they need DARPA goes to a place where fact meets science fiction scientist Steve Jacobson at raytheon-sarcos and lockheed ii is working to create a new breed of soldier with superhuman powers his creation the exoskeleton combines a man and a machine to offer extraordinary strength if you put 200 pounds of body armor on somebody right now they're gonna walk about 300 feet if you put 200 pounds of aren't body armor on somebody wearing an exoskeleton they can walk all day the exoskeleton mirrors the human body a computer network serves as its nervous system hydraulic valves and actuators function as muscles and its skeleton is made of aluminum the challenge of putting a person inside a machine is a daunting one know when you put a machine around person there's all sorts of places where it interferes with emotion it may have braids your skin when you first put it on and it's not powered up it feels very heavy because you're wearing a 200 pound robot which is a lot of weight already to power up power up as soon as they power it up all that weight goes away and suddenly you feel like  Rex Jamison where's what is probably the most advanced design currently being tested by a human operator the risk is that it's extraordinarily fast and extraordinarily strong so if it decides to do something you know I can't fight it the exoskeleton is designed to amplify the operators movement without blocking it to read his motion enhance it and make him stronger the superhuman stamina of the exoskeleton makes it a priceless military asset it will allow a soldier to lift 100 pounds with no more effort than lifting 10 when I'm lifting heavy things with the exoskeleton it's surprising you look at the object and your brain thinks you can't pick that up you don't feel any stronger than exascale them but then then you reach out to pick it up and there's no effort at all and it continually surprises me it feels like I'm lifting a problem how much load are you fill in and pulling 200 pounds moving things is one of the large forgotten jobs in the military and the exoskeleton was designed to help an individual soldier move boxes all day long without getting tired 35 pound ammunition can you know a normal man can lift without much problem but after lifting 20 of them they're gonna get really tired and it requires no effort on my part so I could do it forever basically  by reducing fatigue the exoskeleton can enhance the combat performance of the warfighter and the exoskeleton is more than strong it's light on its feet the fun part for me about operating extra filament are they speed moves like punching bag and soccer ball it's very quick and very precise and surprising given how much power it has how I can follow you so quickly the exoskeleton is the best robot in the world right now because there's no other robot in the world that you can climb in to move really do work and not get tired one of the joys of the exoskeleton is watching someone's face who sees it for the first time because to them this has been science fiction but all of a sudden science fiction is real they see a machine on the person and they know tomorrow's here the army is adapting the exoskeleton for supply handling to help our troops bear the burdens of war but strength and stamina are not enough a war fighters survival depends on locating the enemy a new DARPA breakthrough answers that need  for our troops survival means spotting an enemy sniper on a rooftop before he spots you when Iraq started it was very clear in the urban area and that what people really wanted was surveillance but they didn't want it from ten miles away they just wanted to know what was on the next block DARPA solution the wasp it's no bigger than a toy but looks can be deceiving the thing I think that makes wasps so unique is it has all the same features that are found in a full-size airplane it has an altimeter it has a gyro it has GPS it has a magnetometer all of these things that are found in full-size airplanes are found in a package less than 26 inches and weighs at less than a pound each stage or block of the wasp produced by the Aero vironment corporation was supervised by DARPA program manager Leo Christodoulou this is the block 3 production aircraft this aircraft has multiple capability with modular payloads such as this one which is a high-resolution camera but he could also have a night-vision camera or indeed he could have an extra battery to give it increased endurance think of it as airborne binoculars for the infantry it has the capability to accomplish complex missions with high degree of autonomy in cases where it loses communication and has no instructions you will go to a rally point it will go to a specific location in wait for you there the wasp has already proved effective on covert combat missions where it can be used to help detect snipers for terrorist hideouts one of the key design objectives of the wasp was the ability for a single warfighter to quickly efficiently and easily assemble it and fly in in very short order what I have in the backpack here as a micro air vehicle that a single man can operate here's the air vehicle itself  this is a night camera this is the camera we use for flying in the day this is the controller I use to view the video and control the aircraft in Wilson flight and this is the RF unit which sends up the command to the aircraft and then receives video I'm here at a test range in California we're gonna send this what if American War fighters could stop a rocket-propelled grenade spot the enemy with binoculars in the sky March all day with superhuman strength  swim twice as fast with half the effort sound impossible one shadowy US agency is making all this and more  DARPA the agency that's America's secret weapon  for US forces it's a dangerous world out there but the American warfighter has someone watching his back even though he may never have heard the name drive past this complex on a street near Washington DC and it looks like any other office building there's no logo on the outside no hint to who works here DARPA the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency it's the R&D arm of the Defense Department DARPA enables the game-changing military breakthroughs that others dismiss as impossible if I have an idea for a new tank DARPA is not going to be interested in that they're gonna say go to a company that makes tanks but if I have an idea for a hover tank or an invisible tank and I can show a reasonable scientific plan to get to that end goal DARPA is the one who's gonna fund that  DARPA has granted National Geographic filmmakers unprecedented access to closely guarded labs remote proving grounds and underwater test areas at DARPA headquarters we surrender our cell phones at the visitor control center badge then we are escorted to the only room where interviews can be conducted [Music] sometimes our questions hit a brick wall you know I don't go down that road the security reason don't want to tell you the secret sauce um yeah can i no talk about that let's not talk about that fun for now from developing ways to spot hidden threats in Iraq to designing hypersonic jets that can fly more than five times the speed of sound DARPA tackles what they called DARPA hard problems looking at a problem that's really difficult you just say that's too hard to do and if you if you answer the question like that then it's a DARPA heart problem the highest risk possible is when you put resources on something and you have no idea whether it's going to happen those are DARPA heart problems the problems that are too hard to solve DARPA hard we kill them the world faces a new kind of terror that has transformed the nature of combat America's war fighters have an urgent need for new weapons and defenses to fight a hidden enemy whose attacks are unexpected and deadly case in point how to defend our troops against rocket-propelled grenades in Iraq RPGs are a leading cause of combat death they are cheap to make fast RPG armored vehicles somewhere out on the range way out there and I'm gonna find it with this  the target vehicle doesn't stop until it's far beyond his line-of-sight lost in the distance okay I've done the pre-flight system checks are good and we're gonna launch the vehicle and go find that guy  powered by an electric motor the wasp block 3 can travel at a speed of up to 40 miles per hour it's capable of flying for 45 minutes to a distance as far as three miles away from its operator so I'm looking down the road here and we're just seeing where you might have gone or look at the side left and right and I'll just keep looking around ever inside view camera here and I'm just looking to see you if you can find him  there is there's the vehicle we were able to find the vehicle even more surprising than how well the wasp flies is the way it lands when the wasp lands it's designed to break apart in order to absorb air energy very much like a NASCAR is designed to break apart when they crash that's the way we design our UAVs such that when they break apart the energy of the zorb the piece parts may fall apart but then you can pick them up and you can put the airplane right back together again and it's ready to fly [Music] [Applause] [Music] not only was it darker hard technologically but he was DARPA fast in terms of getting it into the hands of the operators we needed to turn this aircraft into a robust tough little bird that could take everything that the warfighter my family with the wasp DARPA helps put the element of surprise on our side and surprise has always been part of DARPA DNA since a day that shook the world  DARPA was founded when one of our enemies took us by surprise 50 years ago we had Sputnik launched by the Russians which greatly surprised this country we never believed that they were going to get to space first darphus primary mission from the very beginning this would be an agency whose job is to prevent technological surprise to the United States over the years we have found that the best way to prevent technological surprise is to create it so we have gone out and created surprise in order to prevent it from happening to us DARPA gave America the high-tech edge with breakthroughs like the Saturn moon rocket that began as a DARPA program and stealth technology the reason you have a GPS receiver the reason you have cellphones so small because DARPA created the technology many years ago many other innovations that DARPA helped to pioneer from the computer mouse to the Internet have transformed our lives DARPA has been involved from the very beginning in enabling technologies if we could have a sticker it would say DARPA inside and and that sticker would go to every high-technology product there probably is DARPA is quest for advanced technology ratcheted up after the deadly attacks of 9/11 suddenly we faced a determined and elusive enemy who posed an unnerving new threat I actually worked in the Pentagon at the time and after 9/11 word came down that it was imperative that we had systems that could get places fast over long distances DARPA envisioned a game-changer that could fly over 4,000 miles per hour twice as fast as the fastest jet Mini's can be fired from anywhere and race to their targets in seconds a seemingly unstoppable threat DARPA solution a revolutionary technology called Iron Curtain an Iron Curtain was developed to protect lives lives of people in armored vehicles line armored vehicles against threats such as Rockapella grenades many RPGs are so powerful they can penetrate a concrete wall or a foot of solid steel  it takes an RPG about a tenth of a second to travel 15 yards to its target darphus team has to develop something fast and powerful enough to detect track and destroy it in a split second just inches from the vehicle itself but can it be done  at a remote site on the Utah Salt Flats scientists prepare to test the iron curtain system on an armored Humvee it's about to be subjected to an attack by simulated RPG fire as the RPG is flying in the first sensor that sees it is the radar this is the radar antenna so they can track the RPG as it comes in the second sensor that sees it is there's all along here there's an optical sensor and as the RPG flies underneath we're able to select at the exact aim point the countermeasure then has an effect on the exact point that you want it to now since we can't have explosive countermeasures on the test that we're doing out here today we use instead a system that we call the diode gun and we set up the lights in sequence so that they travel down at the exact same speed that the countermeasure would be going so we can see then with the high-speed camera that's operating at about 30,000 frames per second we can see precisely where the countermeasure would have hit the RPG today's test will require pinpoint radar detection of the incoming threat and an instant trigger of the countermeasure system before the test the equipment must be calibrated they aim the air cannon precisely using a laser okay that's good a little bit to the right that looks good  we have an autonomous system that's GPS guided the guide system around the track so that we can conduct our experiments completely unmanned in three two one go  [Music]  all right let's watch the high-speed only by examining the data can technicians tell if Iron Curtain worked in the critical time frame required footage shot by their high-speed camera indicates that the sensors detected the incoming RPG threat the countermeasures would have effectively been deployed in time to stop the RPG in about 1/10 of a second [Music]  the Utah test of the iron curtain system using simulated RPGs is a success but can Iron Curtain stop deadly live RPG fire in the case of Iron Curtain we have had", "XCdQnB8Qx9k": "[Music] yo what's up MTV it's your boy Matt your boy little demo your boy little D welcome to my crib you know this looks like regular plywood and it actually is in fact regular fly work to clean England one time someone broke out a window feel great through it and so they use plywood to cover that up this plow was actually very similar to that so that's why I got I got it imported from San Antonio this is my crib you can see the peeling stuff Connecticut you might think at first glance there's no glass in this house but is this new stuff that actually it's so clear you can't even see it so that's why I got it all put in just wanted it to be grillage it can't touch it here does the drink or anything we got actual I mean actual magic [Music]  oh but you didn't expect that hey look that way  [Music]  welcome to demolition ranch this episode is sponsored by raid shadow legends and the brand-new collection

could not do what we do without sponsors like raid so definitely go check them out I appreciate their support now let's see what we have over here a while back we've made videos on this gun it's the standard manufacturing DP 12 it is a double barrel double mag tube 12-gauge shotgun pump very interesting design here this is a Gilboa snake chambered in five five six it also has two barrels this one actually has two triggers so you can decide which one you want to fire you also see it has two magazines a very interesting rifle and I like weird stuff like this I like unique stuff like this and then I found out that standard manufacturing has come out with another this is the standard manufacturing thunderstruck and what makes it unique is it has two barrels as well this is chambered in 22 Magnum it is a revolver this is the snap caps and what's weird about this gun over these two is these with every trigger pull fire one shot the shotgun only has one trigger so you pump it and you pull it twice one for one barrel one for the other barrel this one has two triggers so it's a semi-automatic just like any AR this one fires the right side this one fires the left side this one only has one trigger and it's considered volley fire with the snap cast back in when I pull this trigger it apparently will fire two shots at one time so the ATF in the National Firearms Act defines a machine gun to include any weapon which shoots more than one shot by a single function of the trigger one single function pulling it back fires two shots yet this is somehow not a machine gun and it on their website it says it has been cleared the ATF clear that this gun is not a machine gun but it seems to be dancing the line which is perfect for me that is my Massimo warrior 1000 just got it not so long ago thousand CC side-by-side helped us get back here on the new property - kind of a weird spot loading this thing up with the 22 mag so remember this is 22 Magnum which is a fairly powerful round for a 22 and it's shooting two of them at once which never done before so we'll see how that goes all right fairly small pistol it's really weird putting two fingers on the trigger but it's a double action and you're having to pull too back so it makes sense you want more leverage alright probably should put my ear on because I bet this is gonna be very loud out of the one inch barrel so they say this is the ultimate in personal protection because you can fire eight rounds of 22 Magnum in three seconds with just the four pulls of the trigger  very loud though I think it has a 1 in 1/8 or one and a quarter inch barrel well it has to you know I always say what's better than one barrel is two barrels but what is better than two barrels that'd be four barrels all right I'm gonna try to shoot as fast as I can I have the whole cylinder loaded up you may not know what this is but it's a watermelon that I've had in a freezer for a few months we're gonna use it for a different video we just never did now that the outside is thawing out it's just just peeling off super weird anyway the inside still frozen solid we're gonna shoot the watermelon with the 22 mag man anything in here cuz it it went in that might be from just hitting the ground there yeah this is definitely where it went in it didn't explode it usually watermelons like explode but this one since it's frozen it will stay together okay apparently frozen watermelon is the toughest thing in the world  definitely dirt in that well I shouldn't have eaten it bears the point of this video I was on Instagram the other day and saw one of those stupid ads for these shoes and the ad was just so ridiculous that I ordered the shoes because I wanted to see if they were as tough as they say so let me roll just some some highlights of this ad real quick so you can see how stupid it is [Music]  so I ordered two pairs there from the exact same company it's a it's Chinese though but on the internet it looks like the exact same company but these definitely came from totally from places one says safe boot one says safety shoes on it the boxes look like this and you also have to imagine they were in another box that these both came separately they took forever to get here by the way this one came like a week before this one and they were in other boxes that looked even worse than these boxes but here's the safety shoes you know these actually look pretty dumb I actually thought they were gonna look cooler but the deal is they got a steel toe so you can see right there there's a steel toe in these things so they make basically normal shoes but then put steel toes in them which I guess you could this one is even weirder because it has like this rubber bottom which looks like it's not very strong but they show stomping nails and then it's got this mesh super thin like you'd wear it to the beach and then it's got steel toe that's why I ordered them because what the heck were these guys thinking and they mark it on his being like super tough he broke the shoelace thing I put it on one time just to feel it feel super awkward because it's very light but then this is super heavy I wouldn't advise anyone buys these shoes unless you want to destroy him I just wanted to see what these safety shoes would do if you got shot in the toe with the bullet people and asking me for years to shoot steel toe boots so let's do even better let's shoot steel toed um shoes uh these are terrible they already hurt my toes and I've walked only ten feet in them I've never worn steel toe boots ooh so that seems not comfortable okay I hung this one up yeah I'm just gonna shoot him right in the toe with a 22 mag place your bets in the comments below will it go through the toe no I mean for that right oh no oh no it stop it I think I only hit it with one round there which is actually something interesting that we need to check out is did these things stay to get oh no that's - I think that's both of them for sure okay stop it let me open this thing up a little bit more one round there one round there completely stopped the 22 Magnum but you know what we got a 12-gauge the next shot is a high brass double-aught buckshot this is out of a 12-gauge at our Steel Toe guy team oh it's gone this steel toe is not in here what new shoe not a problem we're just gonna shoot this steel toe and see if maybe it'll actually stay in the shoe that's probably a design flaw when the steel toe flies out when they get stressed we still got a steel toe I can see it but it looks a little messed up oh yeah stopped it though so it definitely took a hit right there there's what your steel toe looks like man little spread out big-time one hit there one hit there that one looks like it probably missed enough to go through yeah that one would have gone through your foot right there this one I think you'd be good otherwise you got one pellet they went through your foot but the ones that hit it solid they did stop I bet they will not stop a five five six let's find out and the snake we got a fresh one over there a little bit yeah perfectly we went right through the shoe this one's actually like hooked into the sole these that I was wearing they were just like sitting in there this one's like glued in but there it is that is your steel toe that is gonna hurt and steel toe will not stop a rifle around at all this guns primary purpose is super close quarters self-defense so they want you to pull it out and you shoot if there's an attacker right there so they actually say on the website three yards or less we have increased that to about nine yards we're about three times further than what they say the furthest you would want to use this gun is I want to see how close the 22 rounds are together on target because right now they're two millimeters apart they probably won't be at nine yards but  still are so that is pretty cool huh let's try that again these two are actually touching so two in and right there so actually those do stay together super super well crazy I gotta go I gotta run I'll see you guys later I really appreciate you being around demolition ranch thank you to our sponsor again for making these kind of videos possible  Bobby  [Music] I'm a doctor yes", "1oRbrvqrnc0": "every once in a while a photograph is taken that is not only disturbing but also incredibly unexplained and there are many out there that most of us are familiar with so hopefully there are a few in this list that aren't as common bar equally mysterious the Grand Canyon mystery man the exact date of when this image was shot is unknown but the person who posted it on the Internet said that it's sometime between the 1970s and 80s he said that his uncle took a trip to the Grand Canyon with some friends and like many they decided to take a picture on the edge of the canyon when they took the camera all to be developed they noticed a very eerie person in the background staring at the camera the man and his friends were in that spot for around 15 minutes and did not notice anyone in the area as the Grand Canyon was pretty quiet at that time of the year the person who posted the photo said that to this day his uncle swears that he or the photographer did not notice anyone nearby whilst taking the photo and have no clue who the man is and why he is hiding in the bushes he sure looks creepy though and people have pointed out how pale he looks and the fact he has his hood up and it might just be a camera illusion but he also looked a lot taller than the other man the biggest mystery of all though apart from the fact who is he is why was he there in the first place as you can imagine there are many theories and all are equally terrifying some believe the man was there to commit suicide but noticed people were coming over so hid in the bushes some say it's the Grim Reaper and others say he could have been waiting to push the man off the canyon thinking he was alone but noticed the cameraman and his friends and decided not to there is no way of knowing if the photograph is real or fake but it has been put through analysis and was confirmed that it hasn't been manipulated meaning if it is a fake then the person would have actually been there and not edited in after so what do you think the disappearance of Tara calico ok so I know this picture is quite frequently used but due to the disturbing and mysterious story behind it I cannot leave out they all started when 19-year old Tara calico sat out for a bike ride on the morning of September the 20th 1988 on a mother's pink mountain bike oddly enough she old her mother they she did not return by noon to come looking for her Tara didn't return Ana murder started searching tracing the route she knew her daughter had taken she did not find her daughter or the bike but found a Walkman cassette player similar to the one her daughter had been listening to and later searches finally cracked walkman cover also believed to belong to Tara her mother became convinced her daughter had been kidnapped but since Tara was legally an adult she had the right to disappear if she wanted to so apparently little could be done without evidence of a crime and despite efforts by a family the trial went cold Tara had disappeared into thin air and no one could help her family solve the case then on June 15 1989 a woman in Port Saint Jo Florida pulled off route 98 to pick up groceries from a food store she parked next to a white van and when she came out of the shop she found this harrowing Polaroid looking photograph beside her car he shows a girl and a young boy in what appears to be the back of a van and the thought of them possibly being in the van that was parked next to the lady who found this photo is truly horrendous the woman immediately alerted the police but Tara's mother did not become aware of the photo for a further two months when she seen the photograph she was sure it was a daughter although thinner and with no makeup a distinctive scar on her leg convinced her it was Tara initially the boy in the photograph was thought to be missing 9 year old Michael Henley but in 1990 Michaels remains were found not far from where he had disappeared two years earlier his death was ruled as a tragic accident and it was confirmed he was not the boy in the photograph Tara's mother searched tirelessly for a daughter up until the day she died in 2006 with the belief the girl in the Polaroid was a daughter and that she was still alive what gets me like I said is the thought of them possibly being in the white van that was parked next to the lady who found the photo in that car park we may never know what happened to the two people in the photograph but we can only hope that no harm came to them it's certainly a disturbing picture to look at and to date who kidnapped them what happened to them and the identity of the boy is sadly still unexplained edna cintron this next picture is very disturbing and illustrates the helplessness of the victims of 9/11 even though this woman appears to have survived the initial impact her chances of survival were very low I know I have already shown a photo from 911 in a previous video but when I seen this one I knew I had to include it although more disturbing than unexplained how the woman and also the man survived the initial impact of the plane is truly remarkable we know that the woman is believed to be a lady called Edna Cintron a 46 year old employee of Insurance Brokers marsh & mclennan but this has never been officially confirmed the photograph shows the area with a plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center a gaping hole of mangled steel and molten metal can be seen with the woman very visible and clinging to a severed pillar waving desperately it's incredible that's so near to the point of impact anybody was able to survive at all in that area it was reported at the time that telephone calls from victims confirmed that not all offices on the floors that were hit were destroyed immediately though and several of the trapped fell into cooler areas and the areas where the planes hit would have been the coolest of all as the impact points were sucking in fresh air maybe this lady thought there was a chance that she could be rescued if she got to a cooler area and could be seen with all the helicopters flying around maybe she thought she could have been winched to safety and it's believed that she was there for a considerable amount of time not knowing that the towers would eventually collapse like I said in my previous 911 photo it was truly a horrific event that should never have happened and my heart goes out to all of those innocent people who were taken too soon that day and I know many talk of conspiracies and such but when they do they seem to forget they are talking about an event that killed thousands and left even more families and friends without loved ones so just consider this when giving your opinions this next photo was taken near Zagreb in Croatia the location is popular with hikers and on the day the photo was taken the photographer was with several friends who were all taking photos and messing around but when looking through their pictures they noticed an eerie figure in the distance none of them recall seeing a person around whilst taking the photo and although it's a popular place on this today there were very few people around and even though bored deer and foxes roamed the woods this figure does not resemble any of them none of them can really explain the strange figure and it does not appear on any other photos the only explanation they could come up with is that it was someone who was I group hype who walked off from the group to pee in the woods with his back facing the camera but they still can't understand why they didn't see the person and pointed out that surely they would have at least heard the man if this was the case some people have said that the photo looks familiar to the mythical Slenderman who as most of us know is a terrifying thin very tall faceless man who tries to abduct people the photo has been put through analysis and it's not believed to have been tampered with and none of the group's seen or heard anything unusual on that day that they could link with the mysterious photo the cabin stalker this next photo is a lesser-known one but it's truly terrifying and caused a lot of debate when it was posted on reddit it was taken by a man who was staying any hunting cabin with some family in Michigan that was owned by a family member called Jill on the day it was taken most of the family had gone for a walk and only two of them were left in the cabin after a while one of them decided to take a panoramic photo on his phone of the cabin so he could show his girlfriend where he was staying but when he looked back at the photo he was shocked to see a figure lurking outside the window with what looks like a knife or weapon of some sort in his hand when the rest of the family returned to the cabin some three hours later and looked at the photo they seemed and concerned and even joked that it could have been the dead husband of the lady who owned the house after taking a look outside they discovered footprints leading from the woods behind the cabin to the exact spot where the figure was standing and if that's not creepy enough the next day when they showed the photo to the lady who owned the house she was convinced the man looked like a husband who had passed away a few years before when he was alive he would go out rabbit hunting in winter months and would return to the cabin carrying his catch and his rifle holding them in a similar way to the figure in the photo after they studied photos of her dead husband and compared them to the photo taken there was a definite resemblance in his posture and the bulky hunting gear he used to wear the person who took the photo does not believe in ghosts but has no clue what the figure is and since the family members who went for a walk did not return for a few hours after the photo was taken he is confident it wasn't one of them the photo has been put through a filter and does not show signs that it has been edited so what do you think is that the ghost of the owners husband some have even put forward that it could be the infamous mythical Michigan Dogman and others say that people robbed cabins like this so it could have been a robber who backed off when he noticed the cabin was occupied one thing's for sure though is pretty terrifying and leaves us with no definitive answers so let's five very unexplained and disturbing photographs I hope you've enjoyed and don't forget to send in any mysterious and unexplained photographs you may have thanks for watching and see you next week for another video  [Music]", "V_q7y3pFGbI": "you do you have your gun out of your holster yes I do at my side I'm not

to stop talking I have an attorney present all questions we stopped at your request do you understand these rights I understand thank you sir you can't tell me what's going on at a while you're walking around with all these guns sticking out it I'm fishing and I'm open carry about fishing which is perfectly legal in the state of Florida another net I'm not answering any other questions  perfect you guys check out Florida Statutes 7-9 0.25  with that shoot 7-9 0.25 wait it's a subsection H while hunting fishing camping or traveling or too far from such an event it is legal to open carry and I said before I'm will confirm that and I think you're right I don't know that it's open carry though I know you can carry yeah I know that it's open carry but but we're going to crack we're going to review the statute but along with that you're also concealed carrying the fun correct which is not legal going to Dieppe did you see my permit in my wallet no fee and go do you out we haven't gone through I asked you if you had a pistol permit and you said you were not going to answer if you have a pistol permit things perfectly right you were referring to the open here that no no I asked you if you had a pistol from them in general I didn't I misunderstood your question okay and that's what we're hearing I'm conducting investigation if you have a pistol permit you're coming to and from fishing we'll verify all that if everything is all right we'll return your firearms to you and let you be on your way but if you permit it it's in that wallet again understand I'm not consenting to any searches or anything so where'd you find the picture of my wife before this one yes sir yes but you're subject to produce the permit upon demand  wouldn't even answer is that not correct I said I do not have an open carry for now I asked you if you had a pistol permit I didn't ask but open  that's probably the right stuff  then you do understand that we have the right those police officers detaining you to relieve you of your firearms until we can prove to stop I disagree with that like I said or our safety not answering that okay well that's all other than I disagree that's fine I mean you're it's America you have the right to agree and disagree right  my business card and my ID number for you sir understood thank you everything the firm's out as I said before will go ahead and release you if I might make a recommendation not asking you a question of making recommendation since you have a concealed weapons permit in the future again I would say that you might want to however many guns you carry is your business not mine but if no statutes were violated I would say that common sense would dictate you might want to wear them all concealed not saying you have to if that's how the statute bears out I would say that common sense so that you don't run into situations like this  I'm a firm believer of the ownership of firearms requests are the cuffs to turn it on you neither their finest arm kind of cramped up okay so the cuts are fine then outsider firm believer the first I would try always never to do anything cut into your rights on that this point we're just as I said we're detaining you if everything checks out we'll be on but I would hide myself where my firearm  required by policy to have a jacket or something over it I would recommend the same for you because that you  you know statutorily that may not be a prerequisite but common sense just to save yourself having the police officers called check you out  I'll be back  what sir  sergeant if you would you returned my firearm we're about just can you just put it in my car for me I don't want to have it and really want to do it that way my business card sir  as soon as you reclaim your property

you'd never know that six months from this moment  Missouri mother of three Jackie Waller would be gone lured to her fate when she went inside he's too late the prime suspect a man without remorse it's a twisted game of cat and mouse he was playing with us the whole time and at the end of it all I had so much faith in the prosecutors in the law enforcement the mystery of what happened to Jackie Waller there was one tree within that area that was dead will be revealed in the most disturbing of ways to be that brazen after the fact to write a book you can't do that  growing up st. Genevieve Missouri mom Cheryl brenneke had trouble connecting with their younger sister Jackie I got married when I was 16 and she was 10 so I was busy starting a family raising kids and my children was just like irritating younger brothers and sisters to her so we were never close but that would all change an adulthood when Jackie then in her 30s and married to a man named clay Waller made an announcement when she learned she was pregnant that's whenever we bonded we finally had something in common then we were stuck together at the hip but it was also then that Sheryl started learning more about the man Jackie was about to make a father he was a little awkward but with Jackie it worked to his advantage he had a speech impediment she felt sorry for him she said you know we I'm an enabler and I'm codependent and I take care of him I feel sorry for him Jackie's parents felt something else I always knew he was kind of a jerk and dad what did you think what did I think about him I didn't like in the first minute I seen him he was not compatible with my family but at least he seemed able to provide for their daughter at one point clay was even a deputy for the Cape Girardeau County Sheriff's Office though he only held the job for about a year did you know him yes he kind of had a little streak about even I didn't particularly care for what do you mean by that a little streak he had kind of a deceptive demeanor about him after that clay jumped around from job to job but then Jackie was a manager at a major insurance firm and perfectly able to provide for the family one that suddenly included triplets hi she just embraced it from the word go I mean we would be in the car with three screaming kids and I would really be wanting to jump out and she would just start laughing she's loved being a mother to those triplets if only they were the only ones who needed mothering she was taking care of her husband oh absolutely it was just like having another child I seriously do not think he changed one diaper she would seriously get up 9 or 10 times a night and still work 40 hours a week after months even years of that Jackie started pulling away spending more time with her sister's family of course it wasn't just clays unwillingness to help that had her seeking distance she knew that he had a lot of affairs did she ever confront clay oh yeah and she'd say he denies ever for everything but there were some things that Jackie knew to be true according to her clay had become both emotionally and physically abusive she wanted to divorce I told you that yes but she said that she had to do it slowly to get out of it safely the last Christmas that they were together he came to the house and I I knew they had been having problems I said to him I said I'm surprised you're here and he said I'm hanging on by my fingertips it was the day before Jackie's 39th birthday what was to be her last year of life over that year is when things got worse and worse and worse as Jackie became more determined to leave clay became more unhinged he probably knew she was starting to move on her way and as you know now it's the most dangerous time the first 24 hours was the most in it dangerous and that she had to be very careful in to form a plan fearing for her life Jackie Waller starts keeping a diary on her work computer of all the threats clay was making towards her and her triplets starting from not long before that big Christmas gathering they read in part Friday December 3rd I told him that I was going to file for divorce he said that he had a feeling that one of us would not be around to watch our kids grow up Friday March 18th clay told me that I did not deserve to live he told me that a divorce would be my death sentence and perhaps the most chilling entry of all Wednesday March 23rd clay told me that if he couldn't get me he would kill our kids he would take them for a weekend fishing trip and then he would personally tell me they'd drown so he could see my face were you afraid for her absolutely we were sitting here one day and she looked me square in the eye and she said Cheryl I know what he is capable of and I just don't want to be dead but then a blessing in disguise going into that spring clay lost another job and the couple lost their house she was like oh this is awesome you get your place I'll get me a place she just felt like everything was lining up for her break she took the kids than five years old and moved in with Cheryl and her husband Bob while clay moved over an hour away to Jackson crashing in a house owned by a friend both clay and Jackie moved on in other ways as well both starting new relationships she thought he was accepting the separation that he wasn't going to be accepting the divorce she said I just I think he we've really turned a corner I really do all that was left to do was finalize the divorce a process jackie and clay agreed to discuss in person just after Memorial Day June 1st Jackie son Maddox had stayed with clay over the weekend and the plan was for Jackie to meet her soon-to-be ex at her Attorney's Office before picking up the boy Jackie called Cheryl just after the meeting she said I just left the attorney's office and I'm pulling up to clays and I'm gonna grab Maddox and I'll be on home the last time Cheryl would ever talk to her sister she told her sister she was picking up her son Maddox from her estranged husband's house but three hours after that call Jackie Waller still wasn't home and I just got this sick sick feeling by this time it's like 6:30 or 7:00 and I start blowing up her phone and I'm leaving her messages but no response so then she tried calling the man Jackie said she was going to see is he responding nothing I finally said clay Waller if I don't hear from my sister in five minutes I am going straight to the police and he said so well you know the phone rings hey Sheryl what's going on I said you know exactly what's going on where is my sister you've done something to her you told him that yes What did he say well I will if I see her I'll let you know I'll tell her call yeah click Sheryl wasn't about to wait around for that call after leaving Jackie's other two triplets with their parents and sainte-genevieve she hops in her car and makes the hour-long drive down to Jackson I walked in the Jackson PD and I just said I know clay Waller has killed my sister she had no evidence but police were listening most agencies will tell family members look you got to give this 24 hours at least it had only been a couple hours at this point due to the circumstances of the advantage the divorce attorneys something just didn't seem right from the get-go with this case so we started working in fact jackson-police sent a sergeant out to question clay the interaction is recorded when was the last time you saw yeah clay tells the officer Jackie met him at a drugstore sometime after 11 a.m. then had lunch after that they split up until 3:00 when they met back up at their Attorney's office he says after the appointment Jackie came over not to pick up her son who clay says is actually staying with his girlfriend in Illinois but because she just wanted to discuss the divorce no I have time you actually saw her here this is she walked off yeah people kind of look poor in your car the yeah I went down the hill  he says when he got back to his house sometime after 6:00 her car was gone should I keep trying to call I mean probably the story sounds suspicious and just hours later authorities begin assembling a team of seasoned investigators known as the Major Case Squad the Major Case Squad consisted like seven different departments and it was developed with the goal of taking the elite detectives crime-scene people from each agency and putting them together the best of the best it is and almost immediately the team finds one very big clue Jackie's car abandoned on this interstate one tire flat as though it had been blown out maybe she flagged down the wrong person for help I mean it was possible that someone could have kidnapped her from the side of the road but that scenario became a lot less likely when investigators took a closer look at the flat tire we had somebody come in from Missouri State Highway Patrol who could tell us that the room was not in any way damaged so she hadn't ribbon on a flat tire it had clearly been punctured while stationary roadside the whole scene was staged when was your first contact with clay before we started circus that hang on I want to call my attorney and immediately after he got over the phone he made a comment that we couldn't search the car or his house not even 24 hours after Jackie disappeared clay Waller had lawyer DUP so detectives quickly apply for warrants to search Jackie's car clays truck and the house where he was staying we had one later that afternoon lieutenant Jeff Bonham and agent Bryan Ritter of the FBI were there during the subsequent searches what did you find well we happen to be standing by the car and agent Ritter looks irenna so saying that's it looks like a blood spot on the back of her car and when investigators searched clays truck more blood smeared on the inside of the driver's side door both samples are sent to the lab and unbelievably when the results come back turns out to be fish blood that's right fish blood it's big head carp specifically clay had intentionally put on the door of his truck and just how does she know that he recorded himself with his cell phone doing this saying that he had just put that fish blood there basically it's a test for law enforcement Jamie but then that wasn't the only DNA police found back at clays house team members arrived to find the hallway carpet missing and that's not all we located what we believe to be blood on the walls in the hallway basically everywhere you see a tag something that happened in that hallway there was a violent confrontation absolutely but investigators still had to determine where the blood came from what happened at that missing carpet and of course what happened to Jackie then I'm looking around in the basement I see this this crawl space and there appears to be like a disturbed pathway where the dust and dirt is I was like hey we got to look in this prospect for days after mother of triplets Jackie Waller disappeared for a strange husband clay left her this voicemail but just one day after that investigators find traces of blood and clays hallway the carpet torn up and a recently used crawlspace in the basement did you think Jackie could have been under there that was a good possibility yes this recreation recorded by the Major Case Squad shows how FBI agent Brian Ritter crawled through the narrow space beneath the floorboards of that blood-stained hallway he crawls back up and says you guys are gonna believe it he goes the carpet runner and the padding's cut up and it's all back here you know in this crawl space so he didn't find a body but he found the carpet that's correct which was a huge piece of this investigation yes huge because several those pieces were soaked with blood did the blood come back to be Jackie yesterday conclusion I think we all had a very strong suspicion that she was she was dead but without a body there still wasn't enough to prove anything so investigators begin searching for clues by reconstructing the last day Jackie was seen alive it starts in this drug store where around 11 o'clock that day Jackie is seen walking up to meet clay approximately two hours later Jackie is caught on this ATM surveillance video that's the last time that we know that she was alive but it's not the last we see of clay hours after that he spotted inside this toy store wearing a completely different outfit than the one in that drug store that's clays truck outside with the trash can in the back what you can't see is the small boat he's towing but you can definitely see it here in a video from later that night we found the carwash video where he was washing the boat you could tell that he was looking to see if there was something on the boat like blood and when police released images of the boat to the public we had a young man a young woman that was out by the Mississippi River saw a small boat of that description across the river floating next to a remote sandbar known as Devil's Island so we searched that Aden multiple times but investigators could find no signs of Jackie still they felt clay knew way more than what he was saying so days after Jackie disappeared agent Ritter convinces him to come in for a formal interview though there was no audio recorded clay tells Ritter that the blood in the hallway that was quote the result of an accident in the kitchen which according to clay was not a big deal the carpet the blood was it enough at the time did you believe to move forward with a murder case against him I think we all knew we were on the right track but we knew we needed war without a body to feel comfortable going and so over the next several weeks investigators keep a very close eye on clay early on an investigation we put a tracker on his truck at that point unfortunately all it revealed was that clay a former sheriff's deputy himself knew the tracker was there I mean there was times where he would go and sit for a while in a vacant lot so it would cause us to get search teams to go that area start searching he was sending you on a cat-and-mouse chase he was he was playing with us the whole time soon pictures of Jackie were everywhere and with the entire community focused on the case clay Waller became increasingly frantic what's clay doing during this time he's laughing the dog along he thinks it's funny he would come by and honk horn say you guys ain't gonna find nothing but fools and all that stuff I had search crews from all over the country here the clay would drive by them he would give them a finger gesture and just laugh but all that breeziness was about to backfire by that time the court had already awarded custody of Jackie's triplets to her sister Cheryl and apparently clay had some strong opinions about that posting a comment online that read in part quote you are dead I promise if those kids get hurt I will get you 5 10 25 years from now you have it coming he just couldn't help himself he had to keep taunting people I saw the post coming across topics and I called agent Ritter and look at it I knew at that point when agent Ritter saw it that he had committed a federal crime finally four months after Jackie disappeared clay Waller was under arrest okay good lucky thank you not for her murder but on a federal charge for threatening her sister's life but would the suspect finally come clean from the first few hours Jackie Waller went missing police started looking at her estranged husband play Waller but still the suspected killer ran free was I afraid of him clay no I was listening to God he would come up here nearly five months after Jackie disappeared clay was arrested on a federal charge for threatening her sister online and that's not all according to prosecutor angel Woodruff in the situation like this where you have a major crime if it gets to the point where your primary suspect appears to be a danger to the community then we start looking really hard at anything we can charge him with and at the same time clay is busted for making those threats investigators also dig up allegations of stealing over $50,000 from a previous job and harassing a former friend before clay is taken away detectives try to learn more about Jackie's disappearance  as he's done since the beginning clay denies his involvement claiming he's the real victim here  in fact he has his own theories pointing the finger for whatever happened to his wife at a former associate named Gary  the problem with that is police have already disproven it at the end of it all clay stands firm that he did not kill his wife even claiming to have proof that will exonerate him clay eventually pleads guilty to the federal charge of threatening Jackie's sister and is sentenced to five years behind bars at the same time prosecutors work to make sure he will also face justice for Jackie we couldn't even prove that she was dead so we scraped together every single bit of circumstantial evidence that we could until we got to the point where okay we're wetting the blood in his house the surveillance videos the fact that clay actively tried to hinder the investigation and there was so much more after nearly two years of turning over every Rock prosecutors finally felt comfortable enough to prove their case he was charged with murder in the first degree and tampering with physical evidence but despite Woodruff's best efforts without a body getting a conviction was no guarantee there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case plus even though Jackie's family wanted clay to face the stiffest punishment possible there was something else they wanted warm stan and ruby rawson indicated that the most important thing to them was to get Jackie back so when clays attorneys approached prosecutors to make a deal we told him we will accept a plea because we want to find her you want Jackie home we want her home the deal was clay Waller would plead guilty to second-degree murder and accept a sentence of 20 years in exchange for revealing what he did with Jackie he came right down until the time when he was going to go on trial and he realized that he was pretty well cooked when the time came play would lead investigators right back to a place they'd searched before a remote sandbar on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River known as Devil's Island knowing clay and how we dealt with him for two years we weren't a hundred percent sure that he was telling us the truth so we were still pessimistic about being able to locate him when the team got to the location clay only reinforced those fears he couldn't pinpoint where she was at it was a large area he says what she's here somewhere then a clue in one of the gruesome details of clays crime one key thing he had told us was he had put a bag of fertilizer on her body when he buried her one of the detectives indicated if you have too much fertilizer it kills the roots of a tree and that's when they see it one of my detectives and agent Ritter was studying the area and they saw three trees and one of the trees was completely dead and they're buried under that tree the end of one very long road was Jackie dug up by hand out there yes I did it myself we started to dig down and we first found her knee we can feel the skeletal remains with the blue jeans the next day we recovered her and it's the first step of her trip oh no not the homecoming anyone really wanted but at least one part of the mystery was solved and then it hit us that we now we had to tell the kids that we had to tell them that their mommy was dead and that their dad did it and what was their reaction we just all cried together and then we just assured him that we would love him and take care of them and that we would do our best to raise him that Cheryl and her husband Bob's sitting in silence with the triplets as their mother is finally laid to rest I leave you now for a little while for a home that awaits us all her funeral was on the day of our 50th wedding anniversary [Music] but there was still another part of Clay's plea agreement left of fulfill as part of his deal to get just 20 years for murdering his wife clay would have to confess on camera to every brutal detail of his crime how exactly was jackie murdered well a cross made of driftwood stands where Jackie Waller was finally found discovered only after her husband of nearly 18 years admitted to putting her there but leading investigators to the body was only half of clays deal in exchange for pleading guilty to second-degree murder he also had to give a full videotape confession of his crime clay says the wheels were really set in motion the year before Jackie died when she first started talking about splitting up in other words says clay she was warned  I was not gonna sign for her safety she came in about May first and said I wanna go good boy that's it okay what they did you dig the hole is you better but here's where investigators really start to question the confession based on statements from Jackie's loved ones prosecutors have always believed that after meeting with their divorce attorney the next day clay lured Jackie back to his place by saying he had their son Maddox but just listen to what clay says really got Jackie to his house that day  she saved me one last thing it was a stunning claim and interrogators weren't buying it nor did they believe what clay said next that after going back to his place for sex they ended up in the kitchen where it all started by accident  when he claims that Jackie was getting into the frigerator and he was getting something out of the frigerator at the same time and raised his head up and then hit her nose with his head and that caused her nose to bleed she in the hallway where investigators found all that blood police says that's also where Jackie probably mad about the innocent accident started provoking him yeah it was he says the point of no return  that she said you never gonna see these kids to hear clay tell it the attack was almost for the moment upon the passion brought on by an accident in the kitchen and Jackie's threats I wasn't pre-planned to kill my wife that day it wasn't the case at all the problem with that claim clays own statements from just moments before the data the hold the day before was not premeditation well I guess you could see it that way and that still wasn't the only thing that didn't add up how many times did you punch her once just once but Jackie's autopsy told a different story revealing multiple fractures to her face and skull consistent with blunt force trauma we new information that would let us know if he was telling the truth and he lied but one thing she does believe is clays claim that after he killed Jackie he put her body in a trash can loaded it into the back of his truck then drove to meet his girlfriend and five-year-old son at the toy store he was at the Toys R Us what if Jackie's body in the back of his truck and his there yes clay says after that he took Jackie across the river to Devil's Island where after dumping her into the pre dug grave he says a few final words  where's my family in the end Clay's confession was hard for many to accept after turning his three children into orphans lying his way through the confession and even blaming the victim because of his plea deal played with still only serve a maximum of twenty years what do you think about the 20-year sentence well obviously it's too light for what he did but I stand behind the family and as it turns out prosecutors still had one more trick up their sleeves it was a new twist in the investigation clay Waller has admitted to murdering the mother of his three children but investigators still aren't convinced they've heard the whole truth and they certainly haven't heard much regret when he tried to blame it on Jackie it was her fault there's typical clay Waller thought nothing of anyone except himself and if there's any doubt about that just listen to this jailhouse phone call between clay and one of his relatives recorded just before his sentencing stand up in court tomorrow tell us himself why should I care what they're going through they don't care what I'm going through you understand no I don't you're not the victim o'clock it's happened two years ago I just move on I'm going to jail unfortunately clay didn't have to show remorse as part of his steal and for pleading guilty to second-degree murder he can't be sentenced to more than 20 years walk out them doors they can't do that more to me I mean I don't think they can candy turns out they could during his confession clay lets slip that he dug his wife's grave in Illinois the night before the murder then came back to Missouri to take her life as luck would have it that was a violation of the rarely used interstate domestic violence act it was close travel across state lines with the intent to commit to domestic violence which resulted in a federal charge being violated his punishment for that crime a much heftier 35 years in federal prison and that sentence won't even begin until after he serves out the 20 years for murder he shot himself in the foot over and over and over because he thinks he's the smartest person in the room but he is absolutely not before clay is taken away to serve out his time he's forced to stand up in court and listen to Jackie's loved ones give victim impact statements the most dramatic testimony coming from his own son  Maddox he was determined his voice was going to be heard clay had no reaction to this he did not think it impacted him at all no in fact there is one final chapter to the deranged story written by Clay himself we learned that clay had written a book detailing the murder of his wife and his actions after what was the book's title he titled the book if you take my kids okay one last slap in the face to the family he tore apart I think it just goes to show you that play Wohlers depravity knows no bounds but while Jackie's family remains forever fractured by what clay is done they are far from broken the kids he orphan has now been officially adopted by Jackie's sister Shirl and her husband bond they are such good kids and I would say the biggest positive comment that I can ever hear and I hear it pretty regularly is the new people that meet them say they would have never known that these children had been through so much and I can testify to that fact having had the opportunity to sit down with them myself that's a good picture oh my goodness you all look like your mom in such different ways what do you want people to know about your mom I want people to know that she was nice funny caring yeah she was really nice and caring and she just loved everyone the children now twelve or just five when it all happened but they still have vivid memories from that time Maddox in particular do you remember giving your victim impact statement yes why was that important to you I just one help make a difference is that the case like I already knew what happened to everything I'm like and I thought I should just do the message just so he knows like I don't care for him anymore it is like he died he gets that he has ruined the bond between us and him and that he he's never gonna have that back like he took my mom away and that so I was trying to show him that you can't undo that Bob all the triplets are angry with their dad and they miss their mom they are now being raised in a house full of love their mother's memory kept alive by the very woman who kick-started the investigation into her death Jackie's sister Shirley we just love them so much they never have to doubt that did a good job at Cheryl [Music]", "oSVA3BBUgQ0": "welcome back everybody this is Chad with Iraq veteran 8888 and we thought we'd do a video on the one shot zero if you guys don't know what that is if you ever heard of anybody or maybe yourself you've been down to the range with five boxes of ammo trying to get a rifle zero to whatever and you just deal with constant frustration trying to get the thing on paper out to range and you leave the range and you still don't have a zero rifle but you're a hundred rounds down the pipe and money out the pocket we're gonna try to give you some tips today on how to get your gun zeroed and literally like five shots and we've got a variety of different rifles that we're gonna be showing off today and just show us some different procedures for them but this is a very very simple process that honestly surprisingly and not a lot of people really think about too much but like I said we're gonna educate you guys today but this is a this is an older of 336 Marlin and 35 Remington and this actually belongs to a friend of ours on our hunting lease and he was having some problems with a rifle he said it wasn't shooting very well he also said he was having some issues with the optic he had a simmons like 44 mag optic on there that was a 4 to 12 a little bit too much optic for a 35 that's just really seeing using the deer woods where literally you don't take a shot over 100 yards typically most of the time the shots are within 30 to 80 yards on the top side of things but we figured this little VX freedom from loophole this is a one point five two four by twenty millimeter and set of tally rings would be the perfect fit for this thing so we got it set up lap the Rings everything got it squared away and as far as Windows is concerned this sucker is like dead on the money at 50 yards but the reticle is a slight bit high on the target so what we're gonna do is we're gonna look down the bore and we're gonna line up where the bullets going to go theoretically with the reticle in in order to do that we've pulled the bolts out by removing the lever and we've also pulled the ejector out hopefully we're gonna be able to show you guys how to do this today with relative ease and not wasting a whole lot of money so first step it's very simple pull the bolt look down the bore at your target  and you basically they're gonna see the muzzle end and you're gonna see the chamber end and you're gonna have kind of two circles so have a small circle and a large circle what you want to do is Center up the small circle which is the muzzle with the large and the rear and then just kind of Center everything up so I've got the muzzle aimed at our large target down there at fifty yards on top and I'm gonna just keep my hands off the rifle keep it in the same place and look up and we just need to bring the reticle down just a little bit so we're going to bring the reticle down and literally we're just going to turn the dial on the scope while gently holding the rifle to keep it in the same place and we're going to line up the reticle as best we can with the center of the target now once you've got it somewhat aligned you can go back and check your bore again and it is humid as heck out here guys my glasses are fogging up like crazy so we've got it lined up again here look up alright went a little too far bring it back up just a tiny bit and bring it over to the right just a hair alright that looks pretty good now we can put the lever and the bolt back in the rifle with the ejector and we're gonna load up some ammunition and we're going to take one shot at 50 yards and we're gonna see where our impact is be right back alright guys we've got the rifle put back together here I'm gonna drop one round in the chamber here and we're going to take a shot at 50 and we're gonna see where we're at on the paper there after bore sighting the gun a lot of guys will use like bore sighters that stick in the muzzle in their laser bore sighters that's all fine and good but as long as you can see down the bore you can literally look down the bore and bore sight the gun manual yourself with pretty much similar results so I've got a Labrador over here set up we're gonna collect a little bit of chronograph data on this Horn of the lever evolution of 200 grain FTX ammunition excellent ammo the way we've shot in a few other videos in the past but take one shot at 15 let's see where we're at  moment of truth alright so as you can see our impact on the target is slightly high and right alright and our velocity is 20 186 I'd say that's pretty uh pretty fair for a old-school lever gun just a touch that's just the first shot - so alright so what we're gonna do is we're going to keep our crosshairs on the center of the target and then we're going to move the reticle up and over but the way we're going to do that is we have to adjust the opposite direction so we need to go up and right we're going to adjust the reticle itself down and to the left it's confusing I know because the shot landed up top and it needs to go down and to the left not up into the ride does that make sense I think it makes sense alright so we're gonna go down and these finger turrets on this VX freedom are absolutely wonderful for this task alright and then we're gonna go to the left just a little bit  [Music] all right right there I'm gonna take another shot definitely save our brass get back here so that's chop number one it's just shot number two fifty yards  this rifle is zeroed in two shots I mean now what you can do is you can just confirm that zero with maybe two more shots and just see if it's where you need it to be before a hunting rifle this thing is done that was two rounds out of a box of 20 now the rest of this ammo should last you the entire season I mean if not longer than that this rifles done let's move on all right guys moving up to a precision bolt-action we'll discuss some of the details of this particular rifle in just a moment but in the first segment I very hastily zeroed at three thirty six and thirty five okay so people might say oh well you didn't shoot a group at 50 yards well we did shoot a group of 50 yards like I said you do want to confirm for sure but literally the example is just to show you that you can literally get on paper and get a gun hunting ready within two to five shots and I literally took a few shots and had that thing right on the money so it's just one of those things now with a precision gun you really want to take a little bit more time to get this thing dialed in really well at a hundred or whatever given range that you want to zero the rifle at but what we're gonna do here is take this ruber american this is kind of a custom rifle this actually belongs to Remington little who's down visiting with us and is gonna be doing a little bit of shooting with us over the next few days but this is a custom rifle he put together with an MDT ESS chassis and we've got a pair of sequence rings that are vortex marked obviously but they're made by sequence we've got a vortex Viper PST Gen 2 v 225 power these are really really cool optics for the money I mean very very cool we've got the elevation turret cap off we've got the inner turret set up to zero and we're going to be using this to change our elevation of course the windage dial we just dialed around unlock it Reesie row it lock back down it's good to go we're gonna be putting some rounds on steel first after I get it four-sided and then we're gonna dial it in really well at a hundred and literally within this box of ammo this rifle will be one hundred percent ready to take out and we've got some live radar chronograph readings here they're gonna use to develop a dope card this will be ready to go to the range and shoot a thousand yards just like that within one box of ammo so without further ado this is a lot easier than the lever gun because there's nothing really to take part remove the bolt now you have access to the bore you can look down the board just like we did before and if you do have like you have a cheek piece you'll have to lower that out of the way or a folding stock fold it out of the way so you can peer down the bore and get a clear shot this is kind of a poor man's way of doing it like I said earlier you can use a bore sighter a laser bore sighter that fits in the muzzle and then you basically just align your reticle to the bore sighter at 50 or 100 yards and you can usually be pretty close to getting on paper for sure but we're gonna aim we're gonna aim the muzzle at the head of the target at 50 yards here and we're gonna see where we're at okay we need to definitely come down some oh these things are so easy to zero all right we're gonna verify that adjustment it looks pretty good and that looks pretty good all right so I'm gonna take a shot down my ears here and turn the lab radar on and arm it okay I hope you guys can see how easy this process is I mean as long as you have access to an outdoor range where you can shoot at least 100 yards this is an easy process to getting a rifle dialed in alright let's see where we're at at 50 first and then we'll go out to a hundred and get this sucker dialed in really well and then lock everything back down so it's gonna be loud with this break on there  all right so I'm just gonna aim for the center of the target all right we are still just a touch hi to Mills so we can basically just drop this thing down to Mills okay so I'm bringing my reticle up to the shot that I just took all right I'm going to take one more shot so currently our reticle is aligned with the previous shot and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use that as an aiming point and we're right there now we're ready to take it out to a hundred getting pretty good velocity get out of there all right so now we're gonna move to a hundred yards and we're going to shoot our large paper target first normally like what uh what I'd like to do is set up a larger target and I'll just kind of make sure that I'm right on the money and this is literally brand new rifle so firing a few fallon shots before we start taking some groups for record but I'm gonna take a few shots at large target and then move on to the small targets there and then see where we're at oh man okay  windage is perfect just needs a touch of elevation okay and that was our what fourth shot we have a third shot that's three shots alright this is number four  all right so we'll bring it to the right just a tiny bit and bring it up just a touch all right shot number five  all right  barrels warm got a few rounds in there too fouled out just a touch I'm gonna start taking some shots at the smaller targets on the bottom on that Leroux one-inch grid and we're going to see what we're doing here  looks like a couple of the shots weren't a little bit high let me just dial the center of the group over to the left just a touch and we're gonna load our mag back up and let's see if we can tighten that up a little bit with this ammo this is some 147-grain ldm Hornady match see if we can't figure out what's going on here so 6 5 Creedmoor guys i mean 6 5 creed is supposed to be like the king of accuracy right this is actually the first time I've ever fired a 65 no say it ain't so alright let's try this again here so I've made a very slight adjustment what I'm gonna do just for just to be safe make sure this thing isn't walking around I'm gonna lock one of these screws down on the elevation turret just to make sure it's not going anywhere and our windage is good right now so  move over to that target on the top right there  okay  definitely looks to be capable of mly accuracy so from here basically what we're going to do is we're going to just fine-tune the optic and get it dialed in shooting five shot groups at a time literally within the next five rounds this thing will be dialed in perfect I really just need to lower it down just a tiny bit here and move to the right and we're golden all right guys we're going to move on to get an ar-15 bore sighted at fifty yards and then on paper at one hundred and trying to get this thing zeroed now this is a rifle that we put together with a 16 inch Paxton barrel we're running a m4 2000 from AAC on the front of it and we're running one of the fairly new primary arms 1 6 by 24s with the acss predator reticle in there and there's very specific instruction for 0 and the optic with varying velocities so we're gonna run the live radar again I have attached the airgun mic I found that the air gun mic helps to pick up the suppressed gunshots a little bit better and actually get the live radar to read those and provide a chronograph reading we're gonna be zero on the rifle with some Hornady varmint Express this is a 55 grain v-max projectile in here and the listed velocity is 30 240 feet per second usually that's probably out of a 24 inch barrel and what we're going to do is we're going to remove the rear takedown pin we're going to pull the charging handle on the bolt bolt carrier all out what we're gonna do is just kind of take a little gander here through the barrel and I'm gonna line it up again like we did last time with the with the head of the target at at 50 yards  right there and we're gonna see what the optic is so it looks like we're a little bit high into the right so we're going to keep the upper assembly is still as we can and we're just going to dial this down and we're going to dial it over to the left a little bit and we're going to look through the upper receiver again through the barrel  okay maybe gone a little bit too far to the left okay  [Music]  bring her back up just a touch ARS are a little bit tricky to get both sided typically in the field I'll use a tripod with a hog saddle on there to keep this thing nice and still I can just let the lower just kind of hang and I can make adjustments to the upper without really having to hold the thing in place once I make the adjustment get it settle I can just look through the optic see what I need to do try to hold the upper steady and then adjust as I need and then peer through again and then just make my adjustments as needed until I'm satisfied doing it for the bench like I said it's a little bit more tricky with this tiny little five five six board compared to something like a 65 or like a 308 but I think we're good to go we're gonna put the charging handle and the bolt carrier group back in here right close her back up and we're going to take a shot at 50 yards and we're gonna collect some chronograph data so we can know we're zero this particular optic add a hundred yards in order for the BDC and the reticle to actually work properly so alright let's take a shot and see where we're at at 50 here  all right so I'm gonna aim at 50 yards center of the target on the steel just a touch high twenty seven hundred and sixty one feet per second that's movin mighty slow compared to the average just listen on the box alright so need to bring that shot down just a tiny bit so I'm gonna hold where I aimed and I'm gonna bring the reticle up to my shot at 50 yards now I'm gonna take one more shot I'm gonna aim at my previous shot on the plate as a standard or a steady point of aim and we're right in there okay now 28:15 alright now let's move to a hundred mm-hmm let's see what we got here  so we're slower than the we're much slower than the listed velocity in the manual for the ACS s so what this will merit is a call to primary arms to find out exactly where we need to zero for our listed average which is looking like it's probably gonna be around 2,800 feet per second out of this particular barrel here so let's keep shooting and we'll get it kind of dialed in at 100 and just show you guys what we're working with here now this is a six Power optic so when we move to a hundred yards I mean you'll definitely need a spotting scope I've just got the vortex you're laying on the table but you'll need a spotting scope to really dial everything in properly or you'll have to take a few shots make your rifle safe and walk downrange and then figure out where you need to adjust on your target which is very time-consuming so let's take a shot at the large target at 100 there and we're going to see where we're at  I'm gonna take one more shot that was twenty eight twenty all right take a gander through the spotter and see what we're working with here  I mean that's pretty solid guys we're just a touch high at 100 it could literally the group I mean it's a two-shot group but it could settle to go to the right just a tiny bit so we're going to move it to the right and these these are half-inch adjustments at a hundred yards I'd say we need probably one click  and I'm gonna aim for the bottom target the top left square on that Leroux one-inch grid  [Applause]  you guys can see it before I do  I mean literally that was less than ten shots from bore sighting at fifty yards to put it on paper I'd 100 making a very fine adjustment and if this was a standard optic that you didn't really have to fine tune for the BDC to work properly you would be right on the ball less than 10 shots not even an entire box of ammo and you're saving all that money and saving time at the range and actually being able to get out and do more shooting instead of wasting ammo on trying to you know line up your rifle look that I've seen guys look down the sides of the guns and everything like that and I mean looking through the bore is the best option and like I mentioned earlier if you do have a gun that you do not have access to the bore you know from the actual receiver itself to be able to see through it you can use a laser bore sighter but buyer beware there are some very cheap ones on the market that do not work very well at all they're not very accurate you know you really need to spend a little bit of money if you want to get a good quality bore sighter we've done a lot of laser bore siding up at Moss when we're setting up customers guns and things like that and right out of the right out of the door they can get on paper at 25 to 50 yards almost 100% of the time basically 99% of the time might say that any given shooter can get on the paper at 50 yards with a just standard bore sided gun with a laser bore sighter but using this method is very cheap obviously you don't need any extra tools you just need your gun a little bit of ammo and a range stay tuned guys we're going to show you're taking this exact rig out to the range and we're going to be doing some testing with the acss predator here and really putting it through its paces and seeing what it'll do with this form and express ammunition once we get it fine-tuned to get the zero in where we need it to be for the BDC to work properly this thing really should be money so stay tuned guys for that until next time we'll see you soon

I'm proud I am here before you When I look around In this TEDx Amsterdam Hall I see a distinguished audience You are the reason That made me accept this invitation To come here today When I look around I see people They aspire to contribute I see people They aspire to a more beautiful world By providing the latest science The most beautiful arts And the line of the best critical articles Or publish the most inspiring book By starting sustainable economic projects And all of you have chosen for that Your own tools To complete your mission Or to make the world a better place Some of you chose the microscope As a tool to do so Some of you chose to dance or draw Or making music like you just heard Some chose the pen Some use money for that ladies and gentlemen I chose something different Thank you ladies and gentlemen (Laughter) (clap) I share your goals I share the same goals Speaking by me I did not choose the pen Neither the brush nor the camera I chose this tool I chose the gun For your sake ... you have already heard Get close to the gun It does not make you feel comfortable Perhaps it will scare you I mean there is a real gun A few feet away from you Let's stop for a moment We try to feel the secrets of the matter You can even hear it Let us stress the fact Most of you probably He never approached a gun before this means The Netherlands is a safe country The Netherlands has never been in a war struggle And there is no need for the army In order to patrol the roads Weapons are not part of our lives In most countries The story is completely different In most countries People face these guns They are oppressed They are terrorized By the generals of wars By the terrorists And criminals Weapons can be very harmful It's the reason In most of the destruction So why do I stand before you I hold this weapon? Why did you choose the gun As a tool for me Today I want to let you know why that is Today I want to tell you Why did you choose the gun To make this world a better world And I want to tell you How this gun can help My story started In the city of Nijmegen In the east of the Netherlands The city where you were born My father It was a persistent baker But when he was finished working in the bakery He would usually tell me and my brother some stories And most of the time He told me a story I will share with you The story of what happened then When he was recruited In the Dutch forces At the beginning of World War II When the Nazis invaded the Netherlands Their plans were clear She is the arbiter With complete repression Diplomacy has failed to stop the Germans from crawling into the Netherlands And we have nothing left but to confront the brute forces It was the last resort My father has been there In order to prevent the sweep And as a farmer's son He knew how to snipe My father was a brilliant sniper And when you arm He misses a goal In that crucial period of Dutch history My father was stable On the plateau of the Wall River. Near Nijmegen And it happened that some German soldiers got in his crosshairs Who submitted for the occupation of a free and independent country His own country is Our country we are He aimed at them ... but nothing happened Then, aim again But none of the German soldiers fell I have given my father Old gun She could not To cross the banks of the river Then, Hitler's soldiers crossed and continued their path My father could not do anything about it Until the day of my father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death He was disappointed that he had not hit those targets at the time He could do something But with an old gun The best sniper in the armed forces can not To hit his target This story remained in my mind Then in my high school I was taken With the stories of the Allied soldiers Soldiers who left their safe homes They ventured their lives For the liberation of a country and a people They don't know anything about it They liberated my mother city Then I decided then I will carry the gun Out of respect and gratitude For those soldiers (male and female) Who submitted to free us Out of awareness That a gun can sometimes alone you stop Between good and evil For this I loaded the gun Not to throw anyone with it Not to kill Not to be destroyed But to stop the bad guys In order to protect the weak In order to protect democratic values In order to stand guard for freedom That we have and that enabled me today to speak In Amsterdam About how we can make the world better ladies and gentlemen I do not stand today Here to tell you about the greatness of weapons I don't like guns Once you are under the line of fire You will realize clearly Weapons are not a tool You should be ranted I am standing here today To tell you about the use of a weapon As an instrument of peace and stability Weapon is the most important tool used For peace and stability We have it in this world This may seem contradictory to you But not only have I seen it with my own eyes When I was working in Lebanon And Sarajevo and other countries And as a Dutch defense minister But this is also supported Facts and figures About the violence, which clearly receded For the past 500 years No matter the picture That the media pass on to us daily Wars between developing countries It is no longer common And the proportion of homicides in Europe Decreased by 30% Since the Middle Ages And the possibilities of civil wars and repression campaigns It has declined since the Cold War ended The numbers indicate Until we live today In a relative peace era Why ? Why did violence drop? Has the human race changed? We have been talking about the human mind this morning Have we lost the drivers of violence in us? And motives for revenge Or bloody rituals? Or extreme anger? Or is there something else? In his last book Professor Stephen Pinker from Harvard University And many thinkers before him They discovered that one of the primary drivers Behind the decline in societal violence It is the sovereignty of the constitutional state The perfect numerator To monopolize countries To legislate the use of violence And that is legislated by a democratically elected government Which legitimizes balanced laws and checks on the use of violence And an independent judiciary In other words, the monopoly of power That has the right to use violence Well controlled The power monopoly of the right to use violence Initially served As an insurance policy It removes desire In armament Among groups with potential hostility In our societies Second, the presence of sanctions Which goes far beyond the benefits of using a weapon He favors peace more Instead of violence Because tough penalties are much better From embarking on an internal war The nonviolence movement is operating today As a balance wheel It stresses peace more Wherever violence and conflicts subside, Trade thrives Trade and economics are other important drivers Against violence Wherever there is trade, there is interdependence And common interests And when there are common interests Both parties will stand to prevent them from being lost To continue sharing benefits Because if war were to start, all of this would go away The war today is simply It is no longer the best option That is why the violence subsided This is ladies, gentlemen The main reason for occurrence Armed forces Keen to monopolize the authority to use violence And you do it legally And only when democracy demands us that This legislation It is he who determines how the weapon is used This contributed greatly Wars decline in statistics And conflicts and violence around the world The participation of peacekeepers and their missions Had already deterred Many civil wars My soldiers use weapons As an instrument of peace That is why the failed states .. Dangerous countries Failed states It has no legislation and democracy in the use of armed force Failed states do not know how to use weapons As a tool for peace and stability That is why failed states can To withdraw their entire regions To chaos and violence That is why a concept must be published Constitutional state This is an important focus On our foreign missions For this We are trying to build a judicial system In Afghanistan today That is why we are training police officers And we train the judges We train the Public Prosecution Office around the world For this We in the Netherlands are very special That is why the Dutch state constitution states That one of the primary tasks Commissioner of the Armed Forces She is preserved and promoted The rule of law is universal ladies and gentlemen Looking at this gun We are facing The dark side of the human mind Every day I hope That politicians and diplomats Development workers They can transform the war To peace And danger To hope I wish one day To give up our need for armies And that humans can live together Without violence and without repression But until that day We must strive to reconcile the ideal of peace And failure to reach it And to try to live between that and that Until that day I will represent my father Who tried to kill the Nazis With his old rifle I will defend men and women Who put their lives to the test For a world less violent for all of us I will defend that soldier Who has a hearing disorder And I will defend the soldier who suffers from a permanent disability in the foot As a result of being hit by a missile fragment On a mission in Afghanistan ladies and gentlemen Until that day comes In which we can give up arms I hope we all agree Peace and stability It does not come without a price He needs a lot of expensive work It usually runs behind the scenes He needs good equipment Trained and prepared soldiers I hope you will support our efforts And the efforts of our armed forces That train soldiers Like this young captain It works to provide a good rifle Instead of the old gun my grandfather used I hope you will support our forces Wherever they are outside the home And when they land within the homeland When the injury And when there is need and care They put their lives on the line For our sake .. for your sake We cannot fail them I hope that you respect my soldiers This is a female soldier who carries a weapon Because she wants a better world Because she wants to contribute effectively For a better world Just as you all are here today Thank you very much (clap)", "PT6cjp_zThw": "[Music] in this video I will be showing how to make a compact desalination kit to turn saltwater into drinkable freshwater this design functions as a normal water bottle when it's not in use so it hardly adds any weight to what you would normally carry on a hike desalination is a simple process when salt water is boiled the water evaporates into steam leaving the salt behind if we can collect the steam and condense it back into liquid water it will be absolutely pure this is actually a small problem because drinking water with no minerals in it at all can be harmful to your health by depleting your electrolytes but that issue is easily solved as I'll demonstrate later this video is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club the first item required for this project is a stainless steel bottle some bottles like this have a double wall to insulate the contents but for this project we just want a simple non insulating bottle with a steel lid the condenser portion of the desalinator will be made from 1/4 inch copper tubing so to attach it to the bottle I first had to learn how to solder copper to stainless steel I practiced this on a stainless steel bowl and it's a good thing I did because my first attempts were not great I learned that it's important to clean both the copper and stainless steel with a bit of sandpaper before soldering and the process requires a generous amount of flux applied to the joint beforehand since this will be in contact with drinking water it's important to use lead-free plumbing solder not the stuff made for electronics my best results used only very gentle heat from my torch just barely getting the metal hot enough to melt the solder until it joined the two pieces a spritz of rubbing alcohol from a spray bottle cleans up the excess flux and you can see how much I improved from my first attempt to my last now that I'm prepared to work on the real bottle the first step is to remove the lid and any gasket that makes a seal this is set aside for now so it doesn't get damaged the lid now needs a hole drilled all the way through it to accommodate a piece of copper tubing one of the first tools I ever wanted when I was a kid was a drill press to make this sort of task easy but you could also get this done with a hand drill I also made a tiny hole near the edge of the lid so the air will be able to escape from inside as I heat it with the torch I'll plug this later after preparing the surface around these holes with sandpaper a bit of copper tubing is pushed through them enough to stick out about half an inch from both sides then I just soldered the tube in place following the process I learned earlier both on the top and bottom of the lid the tiny hole I made to release air pressure was small enough that I could just use a soldering iron instead of a torch but the process of sanding then adding plenty of flux around a tiny piece of solder worked the same way with this part completed the silicone gasket can be reinstalled in the lid and the whole thing screwed back on to the bottle the short section of coppers sticking out of the top will connect to a longer piece of tubing using a right-angle compression fitting which can be pressed into the lid and tightened down to lock it on the other end the little piece sticking out can be removed it's not really needed for copper tubing anyway instead I take a little piece of rubber and press it into the lock nut before screwing it back onto the fitting this will make an airtight seal when the design is being used as a water bottle and to use the desalination feature you simply pop the rubber piece out first now the 1/4 inch copper tubing I have used so far in this project is sold in large coils for use as water lines leading to a refrigerator or freezer to form my coil for the desalinator I simply take this tubing and start wrapping it tightly around the bottle I found that 8 or 9 turns looked pretty good and that should be plenty of tubing to Rican dents the steam when we boil water inside the bottle I decided to bend the ends of the coil outward so that when one end is pressed into the fitting on the bottle the other side will be sticking straight out as fresh water drips from this end we want it to be easy to collect and that's it now we just need to give this project a try  after removing the rubber seal from the fitting the coil slips right off the bottle and presses back into the fitting with only a small amount of force this bottle has a ring built into the lid which makes it really easy to hang from a hook or piece of string which is good since we need to suspend this bottle over a fire I have in this beaker some saltwater equivalent in salinity to ocean water you can tell just how much salt is in this by the residue it leaves behind when it boils this is what we will aim to remove with the desalinator the salt water is added to my bottle and then reattach to the lid which is now hanging over a heat source in this case my small soup can stove [Music] this little stove I made in an earlier video and it's great for cooking over but in this case it was a cold windy day and it was too much to ask of such a small stove to keep water boiling in a bottle when the wind kept blowing the flames out from under it when there were breaks in the wind I did start to see some water production but to speed things along I switched in a larger coffee can stove this worked much better you could of course just use an open campfire to heat this bottle a stove just makes things easier this time the stove was actually so hot that the steam production outpaced the rate that the coil could cool it back down into water we can see drips forming but also quite a bit of steam exiting the tubing this is wasteful so we need to cool the tubing down until we're only seeing liquid water coming from the end an improvised way to do this is with a piece of fabric if you were hiking this could be the shirt off your back we wet this with cold saltwater and wrap it around the coil this will need to be wet again with cold water regularly as the coil heats it up but doing so will greatly improve freshwater production an even more efficient method if you have an extra container is to dip the whole bottom half of the coil into water this works so well that all of the steam will stop flowing and it will seem like water production has stopped but in a few moments water will have filled the coil and resumed pouring out of the end with this setup you will end up with almost all of the water you started with free of salt one final efficiency tip is that once you have built up enough water in your collection container the end of the tubing can be dipped into it and in that way your freshwater itself will act as a condenser for any steam that exits the tubing it's good to stop boiling the salt water in the desalinator before it runs completely dry or you'll end up with a hardened mineral cake lining the inside I started with about 250 milliliters of saltwater I ended with about 175 of distilled water now as I mentioned at the start of this video it's unhealthy to drink pure distilled water so the desalinator is cracked back open and before drinking the fresh water just a small splash of the concentrated salt solution added back in just a few drops is fine the rest should be poured out now thus water is perfectly safe to drink and if ocean water is all you have it could very well save your life this is what the water now looks like being poured out on a burner this time with much less salt you might wonder if this desalinator would work with solar power like a fern L lens or parabolic mirror definitely it could be used with either of those heat sources which I may experiment with later for best results with solar the bottle should be painted black for maximum light absorption and as you can see this happens automatically the first time you use it over a wood fire Dollar

car while my mother was in the hospital just after she gave birth to me and he drove this car every day for 10 years back and forth into the Bronx right now the car has over a hundred thousand miles but it has been sitting since 1982 for he originally purchased a 62 Impala convertible I had always wanted a convertible purchase the car took it to his office near the Bronx was stolen in a day eventually purchased another car wasn't very happy with bought this car in January of 1972 and drove it every single day back and forth to the Bronx for ten years it has been sitting like this since probably mid 1982 so it's been 37 years the first step was to clear out the old bushes and weed so we'd have clean access to pull the car out when the garage was eventually emptied based on a very quick inspection I noticed there was a ton of mouse droppings everywhere so I wanted to wear full safety gear which I think is appropriate after the years of dust and whatever else I'm sure to find as we emptied the garage out which was built in 1942 as we were clearing up the space I felt like I was going back into a time capsule from the 1960s there was bottles of rubbing alcohol on the Shelf from 67 alkyd based paint commonly referred to as oil-based enamel paint from the 70s a bottle of diazinon used as a pesticide until it was cancelled from residential use in 2004 and iran s'en butane aerosol can torch sitting next to a gallon of torch fuel so it was a miracle that the Mercedes is still in one piece now since the tires dry rodded years ago we jacked up the rear in placed wheel dollies also known as wheel skates under each tire now in hindsight I should have brought my hydraulic go jacks these are perfect for tight spaces flat tires or really low cars like on the f1 detail the front was even tighter and we couldn't get the jack there because of all the extra in the garage and the car was parked too close to the front wall so the jack wouldn't fit there either so we lifted each side one at a time at first glance though while looking for the lift points the undercarriage is in decent condition all things considering with the flat tires off the ground and on the dollies and after a quick sweeping to make sure that that momentum wasn't killed by a tiny little pebble we pulled and pushed the wheels over the garage floor hump and into the sunlight for the first time in 37 years which was pretty cool  next I opened the door and let in the first fresh air in a very long time and I will say that the interior smelled absolutely awful a mixture of mold sort of musty ish kind of smell and decaying animals it was really gross clearly much of the interior will need to be replaced but for now the goal is to clean it up enough to surprise his father when he gets home later this evening and to prepare the car for the Mercedes text in the following week as you can see the door handle was really moldy the steering wheel and the dash buttons were completely roached out but to see David's expression of the memories as a kid in the backseat and him telling us stories off-camera made this a very special detail for me  when we opened the hood I was expecting a bit more corrosion but it actually looked pretty good although I did find the source of the horrific odor more on this later opening the trunk for the first time in many years I found the original highway flares in the box Mercedes literature and maps and manuals with gorgeous engine diagrams and pop outs for repair as well as other directions or guides in German from 1969  now with all the treasure hunting done it's time to remove the mold to do this we're using lather in the aerator a scrub pad and the interior brush that was cut down to an inch for detailing like this it can be helpful to have two different length brushes to do this take my normal size interior brush and simply cut it down with scissors making it stiffer and more aggressive when appropriate when working on moldy cars always throw away your towels when you're done there's no sense in washing or reusing them so it's best to use cheap tarry towels for round two we used a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water and increased its cleaning ability by using a steam machine all without introducing a stronger ratio of acidity  [Music]  [Music]  while Dan was working on the moldy leather I was vacuuming out the heavy dust dry flaky plastic pieces that had disintegrated years ago spider webs mouse poop and egg corns and of course I remove the mats and carpet where possible to make shampooing easier from there we scrubbed a vacuum steamed and then shampooed everything to kill or at least reduce the smell at this point in the detail we had each blown through three pairs of blue gloves so I went to the store and bought venom steal rip resistant gloves before we win any further with the job [Music]  with the mats in the Sun we moved to the steering wheel notice the color of the steam drips off the bottom of the steering wheel are very gross we also used a long or normal bristle linked brush here after cleaning up the dash a bit Dan switched back to the short hairbrush for the gearbox covered along with lather and the steam machine with the direct spray tip while Dan was working on the front I focused on the rear leather and seat belts now my goal was to kill and remove the mold but obviously I don't recommend using seat belts in this condition and age clearly all this is being replaced upon restoration but I don't want mechanic that gets sick in the process much the same idea as the Eagle Talon restoration the car was stuck in the woods for many years and was getting shipped out of the country but we needed to clean it enough so that I would not get rejected by customs but not so much that it didn't make financial sense for the owner because it would soon be ripped apart in the restoration project as well so it's the same kind of idea here with the interior in better shape we left the ozone machine in for a bit and focused on the exterior step one is kind of my favorite remove all the nests and hope nothing is still living in them as you can see we had a few tenants but their time had passed next up we used compressed air before potentially spraying water now we do this because cleaning this much debris with water only makes it a soaking wet blob of leaves and grass once the layers upon layers of poop and dust were blown off the paint we soak the car in frothy hose --less lubricant to make sure all the seals were functioning properly before power washing it this also gave the dry and brittle paint a bit of dwell time to lift as much of the baked in grime before we hit it with water while the paint was soaking we installed a swivel head nozzle to the power washer to clean the subframe from the spiders and all the dust over the many years of pulling out cars from woods and Barnes mechanics always thank us for power-washing the subframe so they don't have to reach their hands into a nest and get bitten by a spider when the car is on the lift which I would have never thought of so I always make sure to give it a good blast after our frothy test and knowing that the seals are tight we thoroughly power wash the years of dirt off the paint next step was the wheels trim and engine bonnet before quickly agitating with a wet microfiber towel and soap and a degreaser then power washed it once again  okay now at this point in the process we've cleaned the inside we've taken most of the mold off and we moved removed a lot of the mouse droppings and of course the nests and whatnot now a lot of you're gonna be asking hey what about the top here now the owner specifically asked if we could keep that top on for a couple of reasons but one being they're gonna flat bet it and take it to a restoration shop and it's gonna be an open flatbed so they don't want to take it off with fear that we're not gonna be able put it back on so that kind of makes sense so no problem we can work around that the second thing is I know a lot of you are gonna be asking hey how come you take the seats out he specifically said hey can you do me a favor leave the seats in why because his dad is gonna come home he doesn't know that we're doing this and his son David of course is doing that for his dad and he wants him to sit in the car and kind of feel the way that he felt back then etc there's more important thing sometimes than just detailing he wants his dad to kind of remember this this whole experience so at this point we've I'm using air quotes here we've washed it we really didn't wash it wash it we kind of just agitated it to get a lot of the mold and stuff off specifically so that when we polish I'm not using the microfiber pad to soak up a lot of the junk I wanted to use a microfiber pad to sort of abrade the surface and lift off all the old dead skin but not necessarily the mold and in the dirt I hope that makes sense so it's not like a traditional wash we were just kind of pounding away here just to loosen up anything in case when the Machine comes by it jiggles it out and now I have a dirty pad and now I'm scratching the paint you know etc etc so sometimes yeah I used a little judgment with respect to washing so this wasn't this was by no means the greatest wash but in terms of this car it was exactly what it needed so we're gonna dry it off take a little bit of a breath because it's super hot we're wearing these you know crazy things cuz it is really on it I can't describe the smell it's very very moldy and it doesn't like it you know like oh my god he smells so bad it just hits you in the back of the throat it makes you cough so that's that's the ones I get a little bit nervous about so we're wearing protective gear and they're gonna polish this thing out and then go back inside and of course hit it again you know we still got a lot more work doing the inside but it's it's as clean as it's ever been to restore the dry oxidized paint I first tried the Meigs microfiber pad with 210 instead of 105 or 110 as you know managing residue is going to be the main concern here and naturally it was after you buffed the paint if you can't remove the polish or wipe it clean revealing the paint underneath you as the detailer must stop and reassess what you're doing the amount of dead paint being removed is overwhelming the pad and the liquid or in other words there's more dead paint than there is polish the dead paint encapsulate the polish and it sticks to the paint so it's time to change a variable and a technique so instead I used a red foam pad 210 polish and the modown technique and it worked as expected for a step-by-step guide and specifics on how and why to perform the modown technique click the video link above on a new Ford GT to see graphics that help explain the technical aspects if you're interested now the name of the game with old oxidized paint is to develop a feel when your pad is so full of dead paint that it's time to blow it out and start all over again  the Motown process is similar in theory to a massive snowstorm that dropped two feet of snow on your driveway you don't shovel the full two feet at once you boil your back out you take off thin layers at a time so you don't overwhelm the snowblower and have it bogged down this concept is equivalent to the polish sticking or in this case bogging down to the paint to avoid the common issue take smaller fewer and shallower bites to avoid bogging down and sticking to the paint for extra pop on single stage paint we polished with a yellow loop as pad and 2/10 notice I put my suit back on here because it was getting late in the day and the mosquitoes were eating me alive [Music]  afterwards we quickly worked on the trim using a power drill polishing wheel and flits metal polish I also worked a few tight spots of the trim by hand with 2/10 and a microfiber towel well guys the car is basically done now the big thing is David's father is actually showing up coming home from work from New York City and we want to do the reveal now we have a few things left to do I have to finish up a bunch of the chrome but you can see the areas over here have really been done well we're gonna do some chrome here just finish that up I'll do the other side play with the windows of course vacuum do a few more things but more importantly David's father's 83 years old he hasn't seen the car meaning hasn't pulled out in 37 years kind of a big deal we've worked really hard dan and I most of the day here it's kind of the moment of truth so I'm gonna pull the camera back there Davis file is gonna be coming from that direction and I think all of our hard work is going to be worth the effort once we see his face so I'm pretty excited so I'm gonna go hide in the corner and then wait for him to come out  David you want to go to your dad  [Music]  there you go  good like to hear that  [Music]  after seeing the car cleaned up he agreed with the Sun it's time to fully restore the family car and pass it down to his grandchildren  as long as I can  I was born in 81  [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] and as luck would have it naturally after all that work it started to thunder so we needed to pull it back inside quickly before it gets pulled back out again next week on its way to the restoration shop  [Music] Oh guys we did it mission accomplished David is actually taking the car in and getting it restored so hopefully I have some footage of that the next couple of months or years now again my mission with this video and with this job because it wasn't real job is to restore the car and kind of just motivate his dad to be like oh my gosh I remember what this looked like let's go in and kind of restore it and pass it down to the family so very cool a quick note of thanks to David a lot of times I don't get to fill me so every time I post a video I usually have five or six or seven videos that I can't post meaning you know for one reason or another the family doesn't want that on there and I can respect that in this case David did so thank you because we got to shoot a really cool video and it was a fun experience and sort of be there when his dad experienced that was certainly you know emotional off-camera and that kind of thing so thank you for allowing us to share this so if you guys liked this kind of video please subscribe and make sure you check out the Eagle Talon video where I pulled it out of the woods absolutely discussing the same kind of idea so if you dig this video I'm sure you'll like that one as always guys thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]  [Music]", "zdIFraV6Tqk": "", "nycYxb-zNwc": "", "PIUowqD0uY8": "", "Xg37L5z5r_M":

with you for every challenge that you successfully complete you can ask the prefix to do something for you but for every challenge that you fail we get to ask you to do something so do you accept is this gonna get thirty thousand views  make sense the challenge okay yeah sure place for matches like this and challenge your friends to create a square by moving just one match [Music]  nope that's cheating I'm only but you've one of them nope Jenny will spawn for me I don't maybe it's because it stands on the table I'm not singing it so I mean if I do this matter what size the squares okay no cheater  yeah swear him in on there you go yeah you got it  okay yeah yes to win the band move this match creating a tiny square in the center there are one two three four coins in this room and one two three four five coins in this room your friends have to move just one point and end up with five coins in each row I  want to take the first two heads to just soak it in  so you need five minutes show yeah  what if I did something like that this makes no sense to me I'm telling you I'm very straight down there's only nine questions and that's boring for can't I just know that doesn't work Rachel do you give up Rachel do you give up me do you give up Rachel help me so it's this one of the points there's five okay done if I did this or no if I lifted the coin yeah  the secret is simple it's eleven matchsticks the road explain to your friends they have to move five of them to create nine plus something like that well that's not nine well I'm gonna  create the number nine to create nine  it's an obscure challenge to create a nine no no no you have nine and five sticks okay but I need the number nine I did what you asked you have to admit I did what you asked oh the word nine okay when they give up explain it really easy just move these five matchsticks and you end up with the word spent involves six glasses but liquid in these three and leave the other three empty explained your friend has to rearrange the glasses so they run full empty full empty full empty but they're only allowed to move one block  [Music]  you want to move 100 I'm optimistic but I would not call that fall yeah when they give up simply pick up this glass pour the liquid into here replace it and you've won the bet the glass with water and challenge your friends to float a paperclip on top of the liquid okay I use the tested  come on monkey could do this it's just physics surface tension so I put this in one throw I want to make like a flipping contraption hanging it from the sides is cheating I need a copy  are you kidding okay already yeah  Wow surface tension oh yeah baby oh yeah go B this is good surface tension it's not rocket science come on kick it seriously every time they play something into the glass you'll sink to the bottom the secret is to form one of the paper clips into an L shape then balance another paper clip from the arm of the L and carefully place the entire arrangement onto the top of the water amazingly the paper clip [Music]", "gxwWf-MfZVk": "", "JiJibEepQG0": "shut up  [Music]  [Music]  some kinds of coal today yesterday the high was 82 today the high is 39 look at that 39 degrees 39 for a Texas boy that is cold in October but I just checked this feeder right here I can't hunt it because the wind is just not gonna work for it today looks like there's a lot of pigs coming in and I've been having an issue with pigs this year so I think I'm gonna go down hunting one Stan where one of my target deer is going til I call them tiny T because he's got a little drop tine on them so I call him tiny T but I think I'll bring my shotgun with some buckshot because if then pigs come in in a big group I'm just gonna do some spraying and we're gonna put some pigs down but I really hope that tiny T comes in there's another big deer called Oh Jo because it's big a point that was the coolest thing I could think to call really hope he comes in I've been trying to chase you know I've been trying to get him for two years so I'll be the second year I passed him up three years ago because I knew he'd be a really good deer so he's still coming in but he's just not real consistent he's all over the place every now and then he comes in but haven't actually laid eyes on him I did once last year and I put a video up of that but I didn't actually get the camera on him because he was behind a bunch of trees and stuff but I saw him sparring with the buck that I shot last year that I named hook so anyways I would change  if you're from Colorado and you're used to walking I want to hear it okay this is Texas it's flat I just walked over a half a mile with a bunch of stuff in my back it's hard for me don't judge it but I'm about to walk up on my food plots here and let stand I want to sneak up but it's so cold so raining today that you know there could be something in there and the food plots right now I don't want to scare them off if there's some  [Music]  [Music]  oh my god the Buckshot put him down  oh that was fucking cool or disgusting oops I got excited  dang that first shot did some work I tried to get that big one running off but yeah I should just pull the trigger real quick but I didn't I was like trying to aim didn't work out so well but anyways that was pretty cool wonder if I'll have any deer come in now  well that feeder going off really screwed up my game plan see the big group of pigs ran directly behind me and were downwind they shortly after took often in the woods now these younger ones were under the feeder but there was one bigger one I was waiting for him to get into the line of fire but he made some funny noise I've never actually heard before took off and then the little ones followed quickly thereafter so I did what I could to drop as many pigs  [Music]  [Applause] [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  well that wasn't quite as amazing as the last one the DMV tour went off and they ran around they got downwind to me so the big group of it ran off and they ate the pile of corn so they weren't all tired like they were when I shot him earlier so you know what happened there but they like mean to spook so I was like screw it I'm gonna least try to bust a couple  well the big deer I was hoping for did not come in today but God did shoot a bunch of pigs look at all those  I will add as a finishing note swagger broadheads or horrible I've shot two pigs now with them and I wasn't able to find him when I was walking out there wasn't enough light for the camera but I shot about a 200 pound Sal good shot no blood hardly at all well there was I found one drop of blood so yeah definitely never using Swagger's again because there should be a big old pig up here with all these little ones but there's not so anyways hopefully this will deter the pigs and when I come out in about a week or so I'll be able to shoot a deer", "XV5Wm42puGE": "welcome back to gun and shot TV this is Chris and Tara as we talked about the mini-14 I've been catching a lot of heat because I set out like a mini 14 I think it's a light handy weapon it gives you pretty much everything you need without a lot of extra junk I like the form factor I like the action I like the look of it I like I just I think it's a neat gun I'm not saying it's the best gun in the world but I'm saying that I like it and then a lot of people are also blown up about the whole I said ar-15s aren't my favorite gun I didn't say they're bad they just said they're not my favorite I really like the mini 14 and I'm gonna try and make a video and explain why that is but it's not just because I like the mini 14 it's not just because Ruger is a good company it's a few different things and like I said the form factor is a big part of it but we didn't just start with the mini 14 we actually started way back of carbine first successful carbines was the Winchester model 94 and this came out in 1894 it's chambered 3030 Winchester I've done a video about pre and post 64 Winchester's this was designed by John Moses Browning and also designed the 1911 the browning machine gun ba are pretty much every you know 1892 Winchester 1900 or 1890 Winchester pardon me he designed pretty much all the guns at the turn of the century that became huge guns they were pretty much browning designs and I think he really knew what he was doing I don't know if he had a designer's eye or if he was you know a student of ergonomics before it existed but he knew how to make a gun that was handy easy to carry pointed well you know it just feels good in the hand you know if you've never tried an 1892 or in 1894 Winchester you know borrow one from a friend give it a shot or if you find one just buy I guarantee you're going to like this gun now this was you know a pretty popular weapon all the way up to the 50 and this carbine form factor it's just so convenient it's easy to use and everything but you've got a couple drawbacks it loads through the loading gate on the side here and it's lever-action so you know that limits it to have a rifle power cartridge you know the 3030 is okay but it's kind of long so you're only getting about I think it's seven in the mag and one in the chamber so eight shots not not the most firepower but these are really common all the way like I said up through the 50s you know hunters ranchers people have them in in bakwin or their truck or you know take them in their trunk of their car or you'd see people with them on their horse they were just really popular handy guns just general all-purpose you know Knockaround guns so like I said this is a little bit of a limited platform and as time went on you know things change by World War two the need for a semi-automatic battle rifle was a pretty big deal so this is actually a 50s m1 garand now this flyer is a full-sized 3006 cartridge holds eight rounds in the magazine in a and block clip that goes in the mag now this is a also a pretty handy decent rifle like it points pretty well choose pretty well it's not terribly heavy but it is a full sized heavy you know recoils heavy it's a battle rifle so during World War two there was another rifle that was designed that also became pretty popular this was the m1 carbine this was designed by a guy named carbine Williams it was this F game he was actually I think was convicted of like murder and during his time in prison he worked and like a machine shop and designed a couple different guns I don't know that he necessarily straight-up designed the m1 carbine I think he did some contribution to the design I think there was a whole lot of people that were involved with it and I think he also designed like a floating chamber for simulating full-sized recoil for machine guns and 1911 pistols like the Colt aces with the floating chamber that was his design anyways he scaled down he and other people scaled down the rotating bolt system where this bolt comes and rotates a vm1 grant now this is scaled down to 30 carbine which is essentially a stress ball pistol round so it's not as powerful as a full-sized battle rifle round and in fact it's it's not even like an intermediate round it's more like 357 Magnum and it's okay but it doesn't really have the range or the ballistics of even an inner MIDI intermediate cartridge so these became very very popular after the war when they were surplus I know my dad got one of them when he was a kid at the hardware store for 15 bucks out of a barrel they had a barrel full of them and 15 bucks you pick your own he picked just a standard m1 carbine they had jungle carbines as well for $15 but he didn't like the looks of the jungle one so he went with the plain ones so I thought that was kind of neat but uh these became so popular in that same carbine ranch rifle roll I mean during the war soldiers love these because they were great to carry and work pretty well and after the war they they just really took over where that winchester 94 kind of had that role now like I said the problem is it's limited with with the cartridge and the power and everything the army did make a couple different forms of this too they made this is an m1 they made an m2 that was a fully automatic version of the m1 and they also made an m3 carbine which was this monstrosity with a world war two era night sight which is interesting but I think I'd rather have a modern night sight given the choice after the Korean War the military was looking for for a more updated full-sized battle rifle the brass still thought that they wanted a big heavy thirty-aught-six caliber 38 308 caliber weapon now they did design something called an m14 I don't actually have one of those you can find them commercially as an m1 a it is essentially an m1 garand with a box magazine there's some other minor tweaks but you know essentially that's what it is it's still full-sized heavy battle rifle and those worked but once again a munitions heavy recoils heavy and it's just hard to send out a fully loaded squad of guys carrying those because now they're carrying so much an extra weight from that rifle now we're on to the mini 14 the mini 14 was designed by Ruger as kind of a scaled-down intermediate platform to fire two to three as you can see this is the 30 caliber m1 carbine and the mini 14 they're about the same platform the only real difference is this one's a little bit bigger to handle two to three and it's a little bit heavier obviously and it's got the two to three intermediate cartridge one thing that I think a lot of people don't realize is you know Ruger hired a guy named James L Sulc L James Sullivan who had worked on the m16 he and Ruger were the ones that designed the mini-14 and you know allows you to think the carbine platform where the mini-14 was stupid or was just a scaled-down m14 that's true but years later the army kind of realized the utility of this platform and they came up with their own carbine by scaling down the m16 to make the m4 carbine which was essentially a continuation of the m1 carbine that went m2 m3 and then the m4 it's coming a little bit closer you can see it's got the same rotating bolt action as the m1 garand it does have a bolt hold-open which you can circumvent by pushing down on the magazine follower there it's also got a manual lock for the bolt hold-open if you want to lock and open without a magazine and you can push that down it stays open other than that it's I mean it's a it's a pretty simple just gas piston design where the operating rod takes force from the bullets as they travel through the barrel once the bullets pass the gas pushes out through a little gas port that pushed it back on the piston makes the operating rod open the bolt and that's pretty much it it has a very similar action to an m1 grand how the the action all comes out in one piece and it's pretty easy to take apart and clean I really like it I think it's a handy neat platform it gives you a lot of stuff that you do need without a lot of stuff you don't come in a little bit closer the rifle is pretty simple now to load it you're going to take your magazines it kind of rocks in like kay and there's a little lip at the front here where it's got a hole and then there's a little pin in the receiver so you're going to put the mag up so it catches that pin and then you're going to push it back until it locks in I'll show you how that looks from the side I'm going to push it in here locks in and then obviously if there's rounds in there you pull back on the opera and we'll fly forward now your safety is just this tab here pull it back and now it's in engage you cannot pull the trigger push it forward and now the safety is disengaged so going back to the title of the video a lot of people are wondering how I got this mini-14 for five hundred dollars well I went down gun broker for quite a while because I got this I think it was a few years ago now probably four or five years ago and I wanted the stainless in the wood I thought that was a neat combination they had stopped making it so I was stuck looking on gun broker I was thinking I'd find one use well I found one that was new in box for 500 bucks all it was missing was the scope ring the manual and the magazine so I figured 500 bucks is a pretty good deal I took it and I figured once I got it I'll call roofers so I called Ruger and I said look I'm missing the manual you're going to send that to me for free I know that but I was interested in wondering if I could get a better price on the Rings in the magazine if I bought them together right from you guys because they're missing out of the box so the lady was really nice she said well you know let me see only checking on the Andrew see if there's something I can do for you because we're - mainly the manual anyway and I said you know I understand I'll pay for him I'm not you know not trying to get anything for free or anything but she said well let me look into it so - three days later I hadn't heard back from her I figured you know they'd send me a letter with a price quote or something I went out to the mail and I had a big pouch with free magazine free scope rings and the manual so Ruger customer service hooked me up on that I don't think I would have got it for 500 bucks if it had those in the box but either way it was a pretty good price if you troll gun broker you can occasionally find some pretty good deals on Buy Now stuff so you can see that two different guns here's the AR built and here's the 14 just give me an idea the scale now they both feel about the same way to me but obviously I'll need to weigh him when I do an actual comparison but I want to give you an idea of where I was talking as far as the form factor and how you know how it how it's the carbine form factor I think is a little bit neater in the mini 14 therefore they're both good guns I'm not trying to pick one side or the other say one is better just personal preference remain Lee but I know people are going to flip out about it so I figured I'd hold them up compare them a little bit I'll get to a video where I actually do a more in-depth comparison with some more stuff but for right now I'm going to take the mini down to the range and shoot some targets so if you learned a little bit more about the mini 14 in this video you may not love it you may not agree with my opinions but let's face it they're my opinions and as usual is a fun day to get off the range and and shoot some stuff and want to take out some stuff from the collection and have a little show-and-tell we're gonna chat TV this is Chris thanks for watching have a great day", "O1iDjiLrp6g": "[Music]  so I shouldn't be able to move your support thumb you should be digging in towards about the 4 o'clock position with regards to accuracy in marksmanship what's the first thing we tell guys when we see them missing what are they messing up with the graphs of fundamentals trigger press trigger press so we always say H clean trigger press and then if they're still missing after that we'll probably say all it's your anticipation or maybe we'll tell them that they're having a sloppy sight picture so if your trigger press anticipation they're differently gun or sloppy sight picture guys can still be doing all those three things right and still be missing well we tend to notice is that grip is actually why a lot of guys are missing with regards to marksmanship there's a lot of different reasons behind that one of the big reasons is that we're never actually diagnosed grip because how many around so we typically shoot at cardboard when we shoot it two rounds two and we're good how many rounds do we shoot at steel typically like one round when we move on so we don't ever actually have the time to diagnose what the actual symptoms are with our issues with accuracy so you know I'm not the first person to say that grip is going to help you improve with your marksmanship will help you improve with your accuracy I do think that there's a bit more that we could be saying about it to give guys a better foundation from which they can move forward so about 10 years ago became pretty in vogue to kind of scoff at the old-school 6040 mentality and I was one of those guys that like laughed at it you guys are familiar with that with you know you know 60% of your support hand 40% of your right hand and we'd be like well how much is you know what 62% feels like and I was definitely the guy on your side right now go like yeah that's right I don't know what 62% feels like that's stupid so we started the discussion there and I think where we kind of got led astray is we started to look at guidelines as a strict adherence to how we actually should be gripping the gun versus looking at I think what is a little bit more effective which is a principles-based approach because you know I'm shooting 320 who else is shooting 320 you're shooting through 20 who shootin Glocks okay did Glock call you and say how big is your hand where should we be putting the stippling on the side of the frame of the pistol no they didn't okay so we noticed that everyone's shooting different platforms even if you are shooting the same platform you don't have the same size hand you don't have the same life experiences growing up you have different interpretations of what athleticism means okay so if instead of taking a strict procedures based approach which tends to somewhat remedy to the issues we take a principles-based approach we'll be able to square guys away so what I say or what I mean by a procedures based approach is you know we got away from the whole 6040 mentality we started to look at how we apply pressure onto the side of the gun and one of the big things that guys are told now is to get as high up onto the frame of the pistol and far forward as they can you guys familiar with this especially if your Glock shooters that is a good guideline but from there we need to modify it specifically to the performance of the athlete so we get high onto the frame and we get forward well this becomes problematic because what happens with my support elbow when I get too high too far forward what do you see I start to over torque on my elbow so can I shoot a gun like this yeah if I had to I could I could shoot at the 7-yard line I could shoot at the 50-yard line like this but is this a very effective way to shoot with regards to form if we are looking at performance at the top tiers we need to be perfect with everything we do with our form and then our positioning with our body so yes I can shoot a gun like this not very effective all right if we're looking at performing at a very high level so get high get far forward those are guidelines what I think we should be doing instead is be looking at contact and pressure so those two principles contact and pressure where on my support hand do I make the firmest contact typically with my support thumb towards the inside of the digit and then on the meaty portion of my palm in here now if I get too high up if I get too far forward my elbow starts to torque out so I need to figure out where exactly my Goldilocks zone is in here by either rolling it back or rolling it forward to see where I can maintain contact along the side of the frame of the pistol maintaining contact on the lower portion of the frame of the pistol over here it gets overlooked a lot because where does all the violence happens when we're shooting the gun happens on the slide so intuitively we want to get as high as possible to control grip on the gun excuse me control of recoil on the gun which is true but it shouldn't be at the expense I've been able to have good contact with the rest of our hand onto the side of the frame of the pistol if I get too high if I get too far forward what happens is with this meaty portion of my hand down here it actually comes up and makes contact onto my firing side fingers right here on the left side of the pistol by making that contact I'm leaving this gap open back here on the back left of my pistol what do we hear a lot of novice Glock shooters say about their accuracy where does it miss low and to the left well if I'm doing everything that my youtube instructor told me to do I get high I get far forward you guys see how much real estate I'm missing path of least resistance when the explosion happens in my hand where am i creating it right now I have all this real estate back here that I'm not utilizing okay so shocker when I don't take up real estate back here with firm contact on my support hand the gun rocks low in to the left all right the way that I ensure that I'm maintaining this contact on the backside of the meaty portion of my hand the frame of my pistol I'll take my middle finger and my pinky wrap it around my firing side hand and I'll dig them in there with a complimentary grip on my firing side middle finger and pinky when I go to grip this gun I am damn near white-knuckle in it to the points where my sights are shaking and I scale backwards from there some of the old schools thought that we had about you know you need to relax your firing hand you can cycle this gun at about 0.15 0.16 seconds pretty damn quickly and you can have your hand clenching on it really tight you're not going to fatigue yourself you can be able to squeeze this trigger pretty rapidly okay so contact and pressure accountability with my middle finger and my pinky right here with my firing side hand I'm looking at contact and pressure as well so obviously the webbing of my hand right here coming up onto the back strap of the pistol making sure that my middle finger is making contact onto the trigger guard right here so those are the two primary points of contact that I feel now with regards to pressure when I apply pressure to this gun I'm taking these three fingers on my firing side hand and pushing this way into the pistol the reason for that is because it creates complementary pressure going that way into the gun and then also back this way with the palm of my firing side hand if I squeeze this gun like I squeeze a pull-up bar I'm now sending pressure back towards the six o'clock towards myself and towards the 12 o'clock and I have a lot less control of the gun the reason for that is because I have less surface area on the front here of the frame and on the back side here versus on the sides of the frame of the pistol so if I take up more surface area to apply that pressure I'll be able to apply good grip onto the gun but not start losing control because I'm gripping it too hard okay by applying that complementary pressure back into the side of the frame of the pistol will see a lot that the gap back here on my support hand closes up significantly now if you're shooting one round typically you don't notice if you're shooting two rounds simply don't notice it when we get really aggressive out here with running into and out of position your mind is focusing on okay I got to get to my next shooting position I have to shoot this many rounds at the target that's when we'll start to see you guys grip really open up and if this is a micro error down here that we can correct with accountability in our middle finger or pinky we'll be good to go when we start to really get into these high volumes of fire we have a high heart rate and you got a lot more running to do ahead of you after you shoot one target alright so there's a lot of different dot drills out there a lot of pretty cool ones this is something I found just works really well for me we've got different transitions between 1-inch dots and about a two and a half inch dots right here in the middle and we can see we've got a third row here where we go back between one inch to two and a half inch dots the design behind this setup so as shooters were typically pretty focused in for the first four to five shots that we take when we're under strict margins of accuracy so we've got our fourth in our fifth shot in the middle and the actually little top rope sends out to about eight shots or send me exactly eight shots right here this should feel mentally exhausting to be able to place accurate fire and every single dot now you're going to be able to do it at about 0.72 one second poor dot we're also gonna be looking at here is what happens with your grip and your consistency with being able to have the media portion of your hand on the frame of the pistol member we talked about that middle finger in that pinky you know a lot of times we don't condition ourselves to actually shoot at high volumes of fire so our grip will open up because we have this strict margin of accuracy that we're trying to be proficient under once you get to that fourth of that fifth round you start to notice your accuracy start to go to crap hold yourself accountable press down on that middle finger of that pinky if you feel your palms tighten up on the frame of the pistol it'll be that AHA that's the light bulb moment that's what we want you to be going for okay other reason you might miss is because at our fourth or a fifth round that's typically when we start to chase speed if you know you pulled the shot because you have a strict sight picture it was a trigger press go ahead and call it transitioning from the first row down to the second row we've got these two and a half inch dots this is intuitively what we think is going to be the easiest road to shoot this is the hardest row for guys to shoot so you come off of the top row of eight one-inch dots you dial it in and you're like finally I get to go for speed what happens here is guys will push the throttle down to the floor and it won't be maintaining a strict sight picture and the shot group will just open up and we'll see things really go to crap so this is intuitively what we think is going to be the easiest row to shoot it's actually the hardest bringing it back down to the third row down here we've got one inch dot in two and a half inch dots weaving in and out of them you'll shoot each one and start with a single round take the make up shot if you need to if you break the line we'll give it to you you paid money to be here so you'll be good to go with the middle targets these two in half-inch dots you'll shoot two rounds at each one take the make up shot if you need to same thing if you break the line you're good to go and then as you get down here transitions between one round and two rounds 24 rounds if you shoot a clean this should feel like a mental smoker a good time on this exercise is around 25 seconds for par time that's where we know that guys are really just dialed in with the marksmanship anything above that we're starting to see areas where we can look for improvement alright let's go and shoot this  all right well we've got total time 18:11 down 1 so 18 plus 1 all right so since the exercise it is a look at your grip consistency on the gun and then just also your mental stamina we've been able to shoot a high volume arounds with very small margins of accuracy so if you guys want to test this out show us your scores go ahead and check out the download link that is in the bio right here", "c80mMzDknTI": "it's been a little while since we've looked at twist patterns or other ways that you can twist the Barb besides just taking a square bar and twisting it up in the vise today I thought we would look at what's referred to as a wheat twist or a Chevron twist I think I've heard it referred to both ways so I'm not sure that there's really a difference between the two and to do this this is another Forge welded twist so I'm going to start with some quarter inch round bar that's about six millimeters around these are 14 inches long which looks like it's about 36 centimeters and I'm going to bend them in half and lightly Forge weld the ends together that doesn't have to be real strong let's just help them behave when we twist them the first time in the vise and I'm going to then twist these in opposite directions one bar left one bar right then we'll show you what else we're gonna do to it so we just want to heat in the center and I'm going to do this in the coal Forge because it's pretty nice to do the little short welds we need in the coal Forge but you could do it in the gas Forge as long as you can weld on your gas Forge it will just bend this right in the middle  this is a place where torch would be good at you could mark your Center and just get a very precise heat but we can come pretty close eyeballing it and doing it at the anvil  and by the time we're done it won't matter if there a hair off this one's about 1/8 of an inch off no big deal and that's all we want to do to that now we want a forge weld this end but first let's Bend the other one and get it to the same point I'll set this one aside while we weld up the first one that's real easy to burn this little bar so keep an eye on it just the teeny tiniest amount of flux is all we should need  [Music]  [Music] generally generally we are looking for a lemon yellow color in the bar if it's sparking you've gone a little bit too far if it's sparking a lot you're probably ruined it a few sparks are okay especially since this flux I'm using it's an Iron Mountain flux it's got a little bit of iron in it so that will spark before the material birds so you just have to learn to judge these things  they keep turning it to make sure it heats evenly I'm just going to weld this very lightly I just want it to hold together I'm not trying to make a permanent weld at this point that's good just a few light blows is all it should take that's a good weld I'll set this aside and weld the other one then we'll do the twists  and that's welded well enough so now we need to twist these now for this pattern to look right we need to twist one of these pairs of bars to the right one pair to the left or that's clockwise and counterclockwise or gee and haw or however you need to think of it in your mind to make sure that you end up with mirror images you don't want two identical twists that might look good but that's not what we're after for this project you also want to make sure you twist them the exact same number of turns for the best results so we're just going to do one at a time and we'll start doing the first one clockwise and I'm going to put the weld in the vise so it's well supported less likely to have shears I twist it it just hit the camera I hope you're still in focus here and that's one turn 2 turns 3 full turns let's go to 4 and I've left some end on twisted here that's 4 4 4 full turns clockwise will explain why I've left so much untwisted trying to get it all straightened back out as much as you can that's what we're after see if we make the next bar match it want to walk the same amount in the vise try to put the rich on in the same place and then we're gonna go for full turns counterclockwise that's one - I think that's 3 but let me double check if one more looking awfully tight already and hopefully this results in two opposites it looks pretty darn good  let's do a little straightening this one's a little bit better now you're probably already with me on this one we want to forge weld the side by side and I'm just going to Forge weld the ends I don't want to forge weld the twist because we'll really mash it and destroy it if we do that we are going to flatten it before we're done but to start with I just want to get the ends Forge welded to help guarantee that these will stay together the way I want them to I'm going to wrap them with some bailing wire and I'm gonna wrap them kind of back in the middle because I don't want to just burn the bailing wire off while I'm coming up to Forge welding heat and this won't be a perfect tight way to hold these so you still have to be very careful moving them around on the fire getting to the anvil another option would be to put a little tack weld Bend everything into the middle so you can tack weld the ends with a MIG welder or something like that and that would work but if you don't have that you can Forge weld weld them without and use baling wire another thing that can really help is putting a pair of tongs on with a Tong clip so that holds them together while they're in the fire  so I'm just going to sneak off camera real quick and bring these two ends together and then just a touch more flux just to make sure that I didn't knock it all off there but it doesn't need a lot of flux these are open enough the flux is going to get in there as you're getting real close [Music] real easy to burn this little stuff up so keep your eye on it [Music] and it's kind of looked down in between the pieces of coke so I can see what's happening it looks pretty good and then weld them together gently it will take another welding heat at this later but I'm going to turn it around and work on the opposite in first you kind of see the pattern developing already and keep an eye on this stuff you might see something happening here that is interesting for some other use so pay attention to it it could be some sort of animal horns or something like that just like I did with the other end I took this to the vise and I brought these together so they you will so they'll weld together more readily [Music]  real easy to get this really scrawny and skinny at this point so be careful I'm gonna go ahead and bevel this and scarf it so that I can weld it onto a handle and then it can be a fireplace tool or a forge 2 or something of the sort now let's make it easier to work with it as we finish this I'm going to do the same thing with a piece of 3/8 square bar and upset it a little bit and create your scarf these two pieces then should go together just like that we have looked at this kind of welding before a scarf weld or in this case often called a drop of the tongs weld and I'll link to a video that covers that right up here in the left hand corner so I don't have to completely explain the entire process in this video but in any case it pays to rehearse this kind of a weld before you try to bring it up to heat I know that this piece has to be face-up on the anvil and this piece has to hold it in place while they drop the tongs pick up my hammer and make the weld so there's little coordination involved and the more you practice it without welding the more likely are to get it it's also better to practice it on things that don't matter before you try and do something that's important to you  this is also a place where they tend to want to move and skitter at high heat and different fluxes affect that differently borax flux seems slippery and slimy to me so I don't use borax for this I'll use the iron mountain or the EZ weld it seems to be a little stickier and it's less likely that these are going to slide out from under each other so another dry run I bring them together just like that drop the tongs grab the hammer make the weld let's see if it actually works that way or if that happens  light rapid blows and then back in the fire  [Music]  kind of refine the weld and make sure the scarves are stuck down but be careful not to go too thin I want it that end up as a 3/8 square bar to match this bar necessary we can take one more heat I'm not quite as thin as I could be and I think it looks pretty good just to be sure we'll put just a touch more flux on there just a few select places and also be sure that you're hammering with your decorative twist off the anvil otherwise you're going to end up messing that up while you're doing this the next thing I'm going to do is just simply straighten this up no heavy hammering here you just want to get it back in a line then I'm going to finish this up and put a little ring handle on that so you can hang it from a hook or something and we'll do the last little step to our Chevron at a welding heat I'm going to draw this out this might share a part remember there's four little bars in there and is sharing a little bit I'm not gonna work the end anymore right now  put some more flux on that ends and see if we can reweld it and that's pretty common when you get trying to draw out four bars into a little tiny point so real light blows turning at 90 degrees each time to try and get all that to go together still being a little ornery I  think we got it welded I'm not gonna overwork it at low heat so back to the fire  you just make this whatever you want it to be I just want a nice delicate ring on the end that sure depart again that's really common like I say it's it's just one of the problems with trying to draw something that's got that many layers out that then it's one of the problems you run into working wrought-iron let's try it one more time to weld it if it doesn't work we'll end up cutting that part off but it's almost what I want so if I get it to stick at this point we're gonna quit  [Music]  yeah it looks better and I want to round this up a little bit very gentle on that tip so we don't blow it apart again  now I realize that a lot of this stuff has absolutely nothing to do with the Chevron or the weak twist that we're working on but you need to do something with the twist when you're done with it so it really makes sense to go ahead and weld it to a handle if it's going to be a fireplace tool a poker shovel something like that anyways this is the time to do it so this is just a normal progression for me to go ahead and do all that and then finish the decorative element kind of at the end so I don't mess it up while I'm doing the Forge welding but in the meantime go ahead and finish this little curl on the end  little backbend this I'll get it hot one more time and we'll put it in this little jig and we'll Bend the ring it looks like that jigs a little bit too big for the ring I'm going to end up with always a little fussing and fiddly looks like that's split again that's kind of what happens when you get in a hurry for the video but you get the idea  and that could probably be be welded up  with a torch and it would go away or you could cut it off and just make a blunt in ring always disappointing what that happens but it does happen  so now what do we do with this well you can leave it just like this if you want to there's nothing wrong with that effect but I like it better if it's flat if it kind of comes together and this is more of a rectangle it's going to very gently Forge it down but I don't want to do this at welding heat because I don't want to weld this or deform it too much it's all going to be very gentle with it so we had a well below a welding heat  that's really all this needs to have done to it just take one last moment to straighten it ups and do anything that needs to be done to make it look just right now I would have the option here of straightening the ring out and REE welding it but I'm not sure it would take at this point so I think I'll probably take the torch and weld it and then we'll file it to get rid of any lumps bumps or anything else not my preferred way of doing it but it will certainly work sometimes we all get just a little bit lazy and think we can do just a little bit more work than we should in this case that curl where I kept having problems with the welding probably would have done better if I'd stopped and clean the fire because now that the fire is out I have pulled a really nice big clinker out of the bottom of that fire pot which means I did not have a neutral fire I did not have a clean fire and those things are both vitally important to get good forged welds so the fact that I was trying to just get that last little bit done without doing what I knew I should have done is what bit me on this and now I'm going to have to fix it so let that be a lesson to you anyways we've got a very nice chevron twist the only problem with it is a little bit of a delamination in that ring and that's something I can go back and fix I've seen lots of versions of this I seen I've seen two pairs of bars like we did here I've seen three I've seen four all side by side I've seen four done in a perfect square bar pattern so that there's one on each corner and each pair that you'd ever see or twisted in opposite direction so the opposite corners are the same on either side that's a very interesting effect I kind of like the flat version of it like this I think it makes a comfortable tool handle nice fireplace poker nice fire tool for your coal Forge if you need something in the shop it would probably also make a nice hook back or something like that if instead of a ring here you do something to mount the hook draw this end out into a hook all sorts of possibilities that you can do with a twist like this let your imagination fly and see what you can come up with I know people shy away from doing projects that involve Forge welding but I consider that it is an essential skill of a well-rounded blacksmith and the sooner you learn it the sooner you'll get good at it and the more things you'll be able to do it opens doors for you it's not some arcane mystery that you need 20 or 30 years as a blacksmith to figure out you should learn to Forge weld your first year in blacksmithing and then use it as often as you can so you do get good at it and then you can do all these really cool twists and composites and if you're into knife making that opens to the door for doing some pattern welded steel which you can't do without Forge welding anyways I hope you enjoy doing the twist with me if you did give the video a thumbs up if you haven't done so already I would love it if you hit that subscribe button feel free to watch more of the videos share the videos with your friends or on your social media sites but by all means make time in your day to get out to your shop make something stay safe wear your safety glasses we'll see you for the next one", "iBkjdutVmFA": "[Music]  [Music]  all right we're out on race today so please bear with gunfire here in the background today we're talking about the 10 millimeter Auto sum of its pluses and minuses and specifically how does it stack up next to a 45 ACP well there's a lot of different handguns available in both calibers so to account for as many extraneous variables as possible the guns I'm going to use are the Glock model 21 and caliber 45 acp and the Glock model 20 in ten millimeter these two handguns are of extremely similar size and weight and the only significant difference being the caliber now before I go any farther I want to say that a lot of people have asked to see a presentation on the 10 millimeter and because of donations to the patreon account I was able to purchase this 10 millimeter so thank you everybody so let's shoot the 10 mu meters side-by-side with the 45 and see how they compare and see if the pluses of the 10 outweigh the minuses the 10 millimeter has a reputation for being very powerful is it well let's see if we can shed some light on that got the chronograph set up at 7 yards and I'm going to start by shooting the 45 now I've got this loaded with Remington green and white locks 45 ACP 185 grain metal case Remington calls it metal case I'll see what kind of velocities I get with the 45 and then see how the 10 millimeter compares  1029 1024 1015 1022 and 968 now let's see how the 10-millimeter compares now I've got the 10 millimeter loaded with Remington green and white box 10 millimeters 180 brain metal case so let's see how we do  1115 1112 1109 1104 1121 now let's go crunch the numbers our 45 ACP has a 185 grain bullet and the 10 millimeter has a 185 grains difference I think we can live with the mean velocity of the 45 is 1011 while with the 10 millimeter is 1112 a net gain of 101 feet per second I'd say that's significantly more but this stuff is targeting ammunition how about some serious carry ammunition well I've got Sig Sauer elite performance and again our 45 is a 185 grain bullet and our 10 millimeter is 180 let's see how these compare and with our elite performance a mo will again start with a 45  1005 1035 1012 998 1036 now let's see how that comparison 10-millimeter and now we'll try the elite performance 10-millimeter 1230 1202 1220 1231 1243 let's go crunch those numbers now with our elite performance animation 45 ACP has a 185 grain jacketed hollow point and we've got a mean velocity of 1017 feet per second that's not that but with our 10 millimeter and it's 180 grain jacketed hollow point we're going to mean velocity of 1225 that's two hundred and eight feet per second more than the 45 ACP so to the question is the 10 millimeter powerful yes is it more powerful than a 45 yes significantly so but that also brings up the question will that greater power give you greater recoil yes I could feel more recoil but to what degree will that greater recoil negatively affect accuracy especially if you're trying to shoot multiple targets quickly well let's see if we can put that to the test now I've got 9 knock down plates set up at 7 yards I'll shoot 1 through 9 do a magazine change during which 1 through 6 will come back up and then I'll shoot them for a total of 15 shots and I'll start with the 45 then I'll repeat that with the 10 millimeter and we'll see to what degree does it's greater recoil slow me down  now let's see how that compares to the 10 and now let's try the 10 any difference and if so was it enough to matter now we'll get back to shooting in a few minutes but right now fair warning this is the boring part of the presentation where I talk and what I want to talk about is that when you have a discussion of the 10 millimeter it seems inextricably linked to a discussion of the case of the late Harald fish now I've done some research on this and it comes with the normal caveats the source materials don't always agree with each other and I'm trying to give you the very short version of a very long story but basically it goes like this Harald fish lived in Arizona he went out for a day hike in the woods news carrying a ten millimeter pistol at the end of his hike when you return to his vehicle he was so he claimed accosted by two dogs he fired a warning shot into the ground and that solved his dog problem but he was then charged by the man who was with the dogs he was forced to shoot in self-defense hitting his assailant three times in the chest mortally wounding him fish rendered first-aid saw help the paramedics and the police arrived this made a statement to the police well shortly thereafter under some political and social pressure the district attorney decided to charge fish with second-degree murder fish was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to ten years in prison he served three years after which his conviction was overturned and his case led to some changes in Arizona law now again I'm giving you the very short version of this one of those changes was it shifted the burden of proof away from a citizen having to prove their claim of self-defense was legitimate to the state having to prove that claim wasn't legitimate and that's the way that criminal prosecutions are supposed to work now there are a lot of people who will posit the opinion that Harold Fisk was fraudulently charged for the crime well I wasn't there but based on what I could learn about this that is an opinion I would tend to agree with however there's also people who will say that he was fraudulently charged based solely on the fact that he had a 10-millimeter and that's just not correct there was a lot more stuff involved in it than that such as he had given some conflicting reports of what happened and some of the things he said were contradictory to what other people had said for example he said this happened at 6:30 while someone who was some distance away but heard the gunfire said that it happened at 5:30 there was also the fact that the coroner or medical examiner gave some very damning testimony and among that was he testified that of the shots that entered the thoracic cavity Warren had already passed through the decedent's hand I don't know where and that that definitively showed that the decedent was in a surrender position not an attack position also the angle of the wound channels showed that the decedent was standing still not coming forward as fissioned claimed well I didn't see the autopsy report but I find assertions like that that something proves that someone's in a defensive position not just getting ready to hit you with with an open hand or any defensive position not coming at you to strangle you or that someone was standing still not moving forward I find conclusions like that to be dubious at best now in looking at all of this and again I haven't seen all the information but based on what I do know I'm of the opinion that it is very unlikely that fish committed a crime at all and because he didn't commit a crime there is very little evidence to show that he did and so a district attorney under some political and social pressure to get a conviction to bootstrap a very weak case and he did that in several ways among that was trying to exclude what many people would consider very important exploratory evidence for example there were several people ready to testify that the decedent in this case had been aggressive and combative and violent on previous occasions but he accosted several people but the district attorney successfully petitioned the court to exclude that evidence and so the jury didn't get to hear a lot of that now what this has to do with a 10-millimeter is another thing the district attorney did was he tried to vilify fish for having a ten millimeter pistol saying that this pistol was more powerful than what the police had and because it was loaded with hollow-point ammunition that demonstrated that fish was violent and obviously wanted to kill somebody okay so what can we take away from all of this well a few things one of which is in cases like this the people whose job it is to investigate these things such as the police and the people whose job it is to decide whether or not you're going to be prosecuted and then prosecute you in like the District Attorney's Office those people approach these investigations with their education their experience their knowledge their wisdom but they are human beings and sometimes they can also bring with them their lack of experience their ignorance their prejudices their bigotries and sometimes their political agendas and quite often things that absolutely should not matter end up mattering things like did you shave that day what were you wearing and your choice of firearms and ammunition and anybody who's ever been the victim of gender bias or racial bigotry knows exactly what I'm talking about but specifically about a ten millimeter there's a couple of things we can take away from this two of those being one if you own a 10-millimeter or you're planning on buying one I would really recommend that you appoint yourself with the details of the case of the late Harold fish because if you're discussing a 10-millimeter it's very likely his name is going to come up another thing is if you are in the process of deciding whether or not you want to buy a 10-millimeter you should make that decision based on are you buying a good quality firearm does it fit your hand does it fit your needs does it fit your budget and the list goes on but there are a large number of people out there who are for lack of a better term bigoted against the ten millimeter and that's something I think you should take into consideration too so all that having been said let's get back to shooting now here's some 3a body armor and here is you we know 3a body armor will stop the projectiles from calibers like 9 by 1947 Wesson 45 ACP when those are fired from what would be considered stereotypical hands on length barrels but what about a 10 millimeter well I've got my 10 millimeters loaded with four rounds two of the Remington green and white box 180 grain metal case and two of the Sig Sauer elite performance 180 grain jacketed hollow-point and I'll shoot this from seven yards and we'll see what happens now a lot of times even if this body armor stops the bullet there's enough concussion to crack that soda bottle so if you see soda leaking reserve judgment until after we do the neck rocks  the body armor did stop the bullet but there was enough concussion that it chewed up this one soda bottle pretty badly so I'll set this up again with a higher quality duct tape and then let's see what happens well three things one it stopped the bullet too even if the three a body armor can stop the bullet it looks like the 10 millimeter can still do a lot of damage and three it looks like this advanced level duct tape wasn't quite as advanced as I'd hoped for let's try one more shot and here's the three shots we fired our two hollow points in our one metal case round so in the contest of three a body armor versus 10 millimeter pistol I've got to declare the three a body armor the winner marginally now this is the point in the presentation a lot of you have been waiting for where we shoot the meat target in fact I'm going to bet some of you have fast forwarded to this part but in shooting the meat target with a 10 millimeter we have to approach that differently than we would with other handgun calibers because a lot of people not only have a 10 for home defense or something like that but they carry a 10 millimeter in the field for protection against lions tigers bears oh my and so we had to come up with a meat target that would be representative of that now if you were being attacked by an animal as it's coming toward you you'd probably shoot it in the front but in a lot of hunting scenarios it's very typical to shoot a lateral thoracic shot that you want to pass through both lungs so the meat target we have today is our double lung meat target and we've got ribs on both sides but their beef ribs not pork ribs beef ribs are a lot more robust than pork we do have our pig ear skin and then over that our leather jacket skin this animal has a thick hide and behind that as always the high tech police bullet stop now there's two questions we want to answer one is the 10 millimeter going to be effective and the other is is it really going to be significantly more effective than 45 ACP well we'll start with the 45 and I've got it loaded with the Sig Sauer elite performance 185 grain jacketed hollow-point so I'll shoot from 7 yards and we'll see what happens  effective I'd say so bullets went through the ribs where they hit the ribs broke them pulverized our lung tissue but we see a big loss in energy our second watermelon lung doesn't have near as much damage and all of the projectiles were stopped by the ribs on the back they didn't even penetrate the plastic wrap the ribs come in a couple of the projectiles lost their jacket one of those jackets was stuck in this second watermelon now let me show you a close-up of them here's a couple of projectiles that hit the ribs and they're just mangled here's the jacket one of them one stayed intact and the expansion looks really good now we'll try the ten millimeter with the Sig Sauer relief performance 180 grain jacket  effective again I'd say yes first let me show you a close-up of the bullets so like the 45 hour 10 millimeter bullets are mangled one lost its jacket and the jacket was stuck in the second water going and one stayed intact and expanded very well so our 10 millimeter projectiles went through the ribs on the front where they hit a rib shattered it destroyed our first watermelon we see greater retention of energy than the 45 had and more damage to our second watermelon but still all the projectiles were stopped by the ribs on the fact they were just barely stuck in there so it was the 45 effective yes was the 10 millimeter more so yeah maybe a little bit but let me show you one other thing now I'm going to shoot the meat target with 45 acp Winchester white box 230 grain Full Metal Jacket round nose now let's see what kind of penetration we get so how do we do the 45 ACP Full Metal Jacket well the bullet went through the ribs on the front didn't do a lot of damage to our first watermelon even though it has four pretty well centered hits did a lot more damage to the second watermelon this is where the bullets are starting to tumble all of the projectiles hit the ribs on the back penetrated them where a bullet hit a rib shattered it went through the leather jacket hide on the back and then they were all stopped by the first layer of fleece so it would appear that although 45 ACP hollow points are good and 10 millimeter hollow points even more so when it comes to getting complete penetration on what would represent a large animal plain old 45 acp 230 grain hard ball is hard to beat and it looks like it can also be pretty effective and there you have it and of course I could have gone on for days but I was trying to be concise so what are the real takeaways from this well first is the 10 millimeter powerful yes is it more powerful than a 45 yes is it more powerful than a locomotive been able to leap the tallest buildings in a single bound no and that power comes at a price in several ways first literally these two boxes of ammunition purchased at the same store on the same day the 45 was $19.75 the 10 millimeter was 22 75 $3 more that won't break the bank but these two boxes of ammunition again purchased at the same or on the same day the 45 was $27 the 10-millimeter was $37 that's a big difference there's also a price difference in the guns very commonly you go to a gun store and you see two pistols of similar make and model one to 10 millimeter 1 to 45 the 10 millimeter is more expensive there's also the matter of availability it's very common to go to a gun store and they'll have a pretty good selection of 45s and they won't have any 10 millimeters and that goes with the ammo as well I can go to buy Mart Walmart whatever and find 45 ammo any day of the week 10 millimeter not so much and it's not rare but it's just not as common as 45 and there aren't as many varieties of 10 millimeter as there are a 45 animal then there's the matter that although the 10 millimeter is more powerful there's some types of 45 ACP plus P and they're not all created equal but there are some 45 plus P rounds that really narrow that power gap but then those come with the downside of there's certain 45 pistols in which the + PM will just shouldn't be used so you've got pluses and minuses with both calibers there's also a social stigma attached to both of these and we talked about the 10 millimeter a little bit earlier if you have a 10 millimeter some people will assume you're a criminal and you'll also make all of those people that have 40 Smith & Wesson's reading envious of you but then if you have a 45 ACP people will assume you were born in 1911 t12 so again both calibers have the real pluses and minuses and the real bottom line is of course that no one can decide what's right for you except you and hopefully you'll do that with some good input and I would hope this was good input so as always don't try this at home on what you call a professional and thanks for watching the 10 millimeter versus 45 video [Music]", "l4a7MBfz-sw": "", "CdKBOi0TCqY": "standby for action  [Music] hey everyone this is jeff of taofledermaus before we dive too deeply into this video we got to make sure we talk about the most important thing and that is how to pronounce the name of this company in the past we've called it brenneke I've heard others people call it brenneke brenneke and many others but if you ask that german the pronunciation is brennick i'd like to thank a viewer named ross that's just the name he wants to go by for generously sending these to us because he really wanted to see him tested and he put his money where his mouth is now looking at this box he probably wouldn't think it's the most powerful slug that brennick a-- produces after all it doesn't have a big ferocious grizzly bear on there and after watching this video you'll probably wonder why they don't have a t-rex printed on the box because these are designed for rifled barrels only you'll notice that the ribs angle in the opposite direction that's to better engage the rifling when the slug is fired the gas piston is supposed to compress against the slug like that to help stabilize it in flight but as we'll see in the test that doesn't always happen let's compare the Magnum crush to the Blackmagic Magnum now the Blackmagic Magnum is no slouch it's a powerful round but the Magnum crush beats it in weight in grains the crush is about 657 grains and the black magic is about 600 grains the black magic leaves the barrel at just over 1500 feet per second and will deliver over 3,000 foot-pounds of energy now the Magnum crush despite being a heavier slug you would expect the velocity to be a little bit lower but nope it's nearly a hundred feet per second faster and delivers thirty eight hundred and four foot-pounds of energy and because of these high weights and high velocities we have very high pressures that's why they say rifle shotguns only rifle chuck guns just have higher pressure tolerances and I would not recommend shooting these through just a normal smoothbore  Wow how help on a scale from one to ten okay okay on the Box they claim to have exceptional accuracy up to 100 guards that's probably German yards in our testing at our private rifle range will be seen if that claim is true and we'll also see what kind of power these things actually have let's get out there to ensure we had a fair test we kept the temperature of the ammunition and the breach at around 65 degrees Fahrenheit  okay this first shot that we're gonna show you is pretty much textbook it was just a little bit to the left but the slug functioned perfectly it flew nice and straight and it just blasted through all those blocks of gel creating a massive temporary cavity as it passed through those things you tell how much energy that thing had yeah I can feel it you can feel it and you can see how it threw that all those gel blocks around and we did recover the slug which was one of our goals you know the best caught it yeah I went through all the gel blocks and was trapped in one of the first best it's obviously they're using a very heavy or a very hard led alloy maybe antimony or something tin maybe who knows no I look at the center core you scratch that sinner and the CEO heard that is because that didn't hardly deform it alright yeah yeah let's see what we're doing here no it slid that's interesting  if that was a foster slug it would have been the expansion all over the place yeah I would have maybe even split it apart there we go oh look at that you can see how the that's the stem retracted in there quite interesting it's fairly hard lid that's for sure yeah okay people really do like comparisons and we I finally got that through my head sometimes we don't have a different slug to test out and or we have with us but Danny fortunately brought some one ounce foster slugs with a rating of 15 60 feet per second I believe one ounce you're traveling about this all just a little bit slower than our the brenneke crush but I think it'll be a good comparison the recoil should be less well I would aim a empty little to the left or right or a little bit but then they'll give you some room to shoot the other one right okay I'm ready the three inch foster slug traveling just under 1,600 feet per second did a substantial amount of damage not too bad now we'll try with the brenneke crush 50% heavier and about 50 feet per second faster in this test we see that we have a failure of the tail assembly this causes the slug to really lose a lot of stability it was really wobbling around a lot there and this is a problem we also had with the brenneke special-forces slugs yeah definitely it's harder this is what was lifting that crush pretty much turned it inside out all the petals are laying back this way yeah yeah and this is the brenneke crush one and a half ounce and this is the foster slug one ounce yeah a little bit different I was really thinking that we were going to have complete penetration yeah  we do have a pretty good bulge yeah no brag just fact hahaha this one did bullshit a little bit but don't got about twice as much here okay and that's that's the thickest let plate we've got very very impressive it hit where you're aiming right pretty much yes okay okay let's see what it does to a mild steel plate see what kind of dent it leaves in that again we have the plate at an angle so there's no chance of it bouncing back at us or anything like that or we're keeping the gun and the ammunition as cool as possible to simulate their laboratory conditions high temperatures will could sometimes cause failures so we've actually we actually have the ammo on ice we don't rather have it too cold and too hot we've seen a lot of failures in the past from over temperature so we want to give it a fair test we see another failure of the tail assembly in this shot despite that the accuracy wasn't greatly affected all these shots so far at 15 yards or 45 feet 3/8 inch ah yeah believe it is this mild steel 5/16 yeah somewhere in there very very deep dent in it almost went through that's almost that one almost my Gogi happy I cried over it actually fractured the steel here almost went through wow this is well we recovered laying on the ground about 10 feet past our target okay I'm surprised we found anything still it's uh almost you can almost recognize it as a slug it you can tell they're using a hard hard lead in their composition it'll splash the pebbles yeah yeah and you can tell by the other dense various other impacts you know give you some kind of comparison of past tests you know if you're not you know if you haven't watched all our videos and you'll know what I'm talking about but that does give you idea it almost talked load that thing had been today actually a little bit but can you angle it towards me oh yeah look at that Wow that was pretty good whoo that's pretty impressive how about a bowling pin got them all very hardwood very difficult to penetrate that with any shotgun slug  okay got a feeling these are gonna do a good job of it yeah yeah hard lead basslet and heavy lid three things that you have if you want penetration that's what you need okay I'm ready when you are  leave that thing go in this test we have another textbook example of how the Magnum crush is supposed to perform as it's flying through the air we didn't have the separation of that tail assembly and because the slug impacted nice straight and true and didn't hit sideways we had maximum penetration on this shot very fairly close to the center at the thickest part of the of the bowling pin I might add a little bit to the right a little right it looks like it went all the way through I believe so because that's the wad right there yeah the wad was this kind of snagged on there but that's the slug is exited the building folks I did not expect that that's you know if there's one slug that can do that this is it we're using these a maple or something yeah sure definitely hardwood I'm sure you know I've watched a video on how they made them it's kind of fascinating and I can't remember but it's a very very hard wood how about some Russian ballistic gel will shoot straight down the grain of this big block of wood see if I can split it see how deep the penetration is whatever very difficult target Russian ballistic gel I'm ready  well it fractured the wood nice clean center shot well we have another tail separation of failure of the design on this shot when we tested the beretta cos short Magnum special-forces slugs which has almost 2 million views you would think that brennick a-- would have addressed this issue and corrected it but we're seeing very similar problems with this product now we still had very impressive penetration as Danny tears into the block like The Incredible Hulk here the slug did break into a couple pieces the largest piece is approximately 7 inches in the wood to taste the rainbow right Oh scatter you're the skittles there you go 6 gallons of water let's see if the slug will pass all the way through that ok you ready to taste the flavor let's taste the rainbow let's do this ok I'm ready  there goes the table well it looks like I picked just about the perfect number of 1 gallon jugs to shoot at we shot at 6 and we had excellent penetration through this now it is possible it could have gone through one or two more jugs I just need to get my kids to drink much more milk so I can gather up northeast jugs okay so what happened Danny we definitely scattered the skittles  it's hard to say which holders in front probably the one that in the biggest pieces I thought I had them all color-coded by the you know the spectrum like that one yeah there's very small pieces sometimes they'll just split them open just one blue them into many pieces very powerful hydrostatic shock from that high velocity this was our last one  had enough energy go all the way through it so we had full penetration of six jugs now you now remember that Buffalo outdoors but there's a 458 SOCOM and that the what is it that the Bushmaster you know the only went in like three judge you know three jugs I think we recovered okay and that was on the ground that was on the ground right the best was almost covering it up okay it traveled with the best out there okay yeah there's a big dent in the in the vest okay still had substantial energy then even after going through five gallons of water and the water seed with it okay or the cushion part yeah the little all the little stem is not there it was going yeah okay let me get a close-up of that after going through so much water not much not much deformation seems he's a really hard center core  look at that of course everyone wants to know how accurate they are we'll take three shots at 50 yards at a piece of drywall should you know shit you up really well and also have a little white puffs when it hits where's your point of aim at you're gonna put it right on the Dodge okay got you okay I'm ready when you are  right into the berm back there yeah okay let's take another one or two more actually okay those are some main slugs ladies and gentlemen no I'm surprised you hold up this well that one hit in the berm again Wow oh my got one high-speed camera shot of the long-range test this one performed perfectly dragging up massive shockwave across the ground the three shot group test was okay if they fix their defect issues they could definitely tighten that up okay it gives you an idea of the size of it it's only about 12 inch square there yeah 50 yards and I don't have any magnification on my red dot that's true my red dots covering that but I can still get a pretty centered so I don't know which was which but one two three yeah a knock a hog down at fifty yards I think so not bad not bad yeah people think we think we don't have a backstop but we actually have a ditch bank back there that acts as a berm you can see them impacting that all right not bad not bad there you go brenneke crush I'd like to see your shoulder after a few days you [Applause] may not want to feel it purple anyway I hope you enjoyed this video always want to thank our patreon and channel members supporters but also our regular viewers who leave nice comments

extroyer as in it's gonna be one of the biggest mysteries in my entire hunting career and I'll never know the answer ever and it's frustrating for that but this is a few years ago and house up north not guiding I've got it for a few years for a big game I might a guy might not I don't know it's more fun just helping people now through my hunting apps and my good friend my guide partner we went up on foot up on top of this this big hill this long this long he else got a big top on it sporadic spruce willow up to here and the old old horse trail used to guide on years ago going right along the top of it and I wanted to stick an arrow on a great big bull moose so had my bow my buddy had his rifle amber were just due to her hi clay we hiked way up this damn face of this thing forever to get on top once we get on top you've got a hike about half way back before it gets you know when we typically start running in a moose up there and I hadn't drug my rangefinder out yet and put around my neck he was in my backpack it's the old same old I'll pull it out let's get up there you know and we're cow call and as we walk the whole way I'm gonna get on the top they're going along Cal calling and I was just starting to think I better get my rangefinder Road and we come around the corner and all sudden this cow goes trotting across right in front of me in this gap cow across and this great big huge record book moose right behind her I'm like holy crap I draw my bow back the rangefinder shot right over like what you know and as far as excitement goes I don't know how many minutes have guided to having a club and you name you name the size I've got it moose in the Yukon BC all third BC in as far as buck fever and moose goes with me doesn't happen that I don't get buck fever I've never wounded and lost a moose in my life I had one hunter lost a huge moose once ten years ago that's about it you know and I've as far as my own history goes with hunting I've heart you name it I've harshed it with a bow and arrow and I'm good at what I do you know and I'm saying this for what I'm a to share with you I shot us back and then it's kind of in my partners Cal calling that kind of stops look back in and a shot again I think it hits some wasn't sure we hit some will or not I'm there or something there's no way I missed that thing there's no freaking way that's a dead moose hey you took off and there's just like little patches of snow cuz it just starts snowing and then it melted again so there's only like patches and patch of snow here patch snow there now go over there no arrow no moose no blood and we see tracks and we looked we looked we looked looked no arrow no moose no blood and it's frustrating them crap I don't mean like what the hell you know we the long ridge back went like this for a long ways like two miles and it was fairly steep on your side and the flat top is maybe 400 across yeah I've about four hundred across top brother we've went ahead again hunted dropped down left all over the place nothing nothing nothing and then we dropped down to the right and started heading back out boom great big huge fresh bull and cow tracks right in her feet oh right on it's him he's on the same slope as us perfect so we're managing to track these guys they're trying to quad and worsen our side hilling coming back on the over top down side hill we're coming back and we're walking along this is going on we had about half a mile to get back to where we were to get out at half a mile the same sighting alongside Hill so we're hiking along and they found like you know what this guy's he's they're going the distance they're going ahead with their walk ahead of us let's get back up on top and run down the Hurst trail and then drop back down and head him off and call will probably come right to us so we we left we stopped tracking him down the side hill got on the top ran down guess we got past him drop back down into the timber again it's getting a little windy - Nadia and then we started calling boom  here they come and he is fired up you can hear in the video like these things Furret this guy was fired the hell out right  Oh  Oh  [Music] all right  so marks up behind me he's got this camera on a tripod up behind me I dropped down the hill about ten yards from him and I'm just sitting there waiting and he's right there he's there running he can hear that you could hear the cow calling behind him to the cow sialic he's ground like an idiot they're running at us  ah  [Music]  so I get down on my knees and now I can see him Marcus seaman coaster clear from where he was but I can see him through the trees and he's got a worm his way through a couple Christmas trees I'm staying dead quiet Mark's 10 yards behind me to keep the tension call him back up to him Kyle : and uh here he comes he's coming right through the thick stuff as soon as his head when I fix up I drew back and I'm aiming downhill a little bit and uh he comes right up he was probably eight yards from me I'm calm as cool and Luke I was I'm not freaked out how many times like right now we're gonna get him and I drew back put the pin on his chest and lots of people freaked out say you never shoot hey no no no we wait till it goes broadside yeah shut up you know what if you can make the shot a coffin making a shot you make the shot anyway drew back I put a square on his chest brighten the V the obviously stop dad I mean he can see me clear as day looking at him and no you can't with this you can see it you can't wait for an animal to turn broadside with your bow at eight yards like that because when he spins it's gonna be fast  ah  you're not gonna get it he stands stationary I'm sitting stationary the second I shot he went oh we thought the arrow disappeared in his chest he spins takes off we sit there quiet Marquess calling YouTube video and we could see him through those trees just stand there his head scan it down and we're looking up we're waiting for tip over little sudden he goes walking off and he starts calling again I'm like what like kind of garbled grunts but he grunts for like huh die what are you doing die he starts going up the hill grunts and he's going uphill no terminally injured game animal goes uphill trust me none of them are like what the hell so we snuck over to where he's lost standing and sure enough you can see the blood here here's that much blood in the ground that's coming I was mouth you know like and it's getting you know late in the day like I can't screw it let's just let him go he'll be dead the morning so we left get back there in the morning found the blood tracked him uphill by drops I mean we're talking dime-sized drops every five yards it was the most nastiest firkin tracking job I've probably ever done and we're doing it right we're not running ahead one guy's two is the bloody market the next guy hands and knees blood marked with an arrow blood mark with an arrow we went up the mountain then I'll suddenly abruptly turn he started going downhill on an angle on a 45 along that long hog back heading back away from wherever our main entrance again and the whole way we're expecting singing be laying down dead any second oh yeah he's certain now he's certain out for sure it's got to be down now and we tracked him for another three hours he never laid down once and maybe a quarter a dime sized drop of blood every ten yards I mean it was tough slogging but we were dealing it we're on him and then I think four hours into it the second day maybe even five we get the bottom into this swampy pond and muskeg here's this puddle of water get this one here's this puddle of water with saliva I'll shares the picture here with saliva and blood bubbles on top just a few little passes snotty weird bubbled snot and my arrow is floating on the water with the broad head unscrewed and missing from the tip what no miss couldn't even tell which way he went from there on we looked for another couple hours could not find him could not freaking believe it went back to the house got on the computer I had bring my big computer with me to go up north for everything up stuff and we zoomed in and went on slow motion and that arrow cuz I'm looking down at all I'm so Mike Killzone I got to get him at chest you know I'm looking at a patch like this probably that deep whatever was a shot I screwed up I screwed up you know what if I screwed up I'll admit it I screwed up it happened whoops not like it happens all the time that's for sure I mean if you hunt long enough your events you're gonna have them you're gonna make an accident and that's all there is to it no I'm owning it I screwed up I've made shots like that a million times I was calm as calm as calm could be a shot his jaw drop multiple uh-huh that arrow went straight down his mouth and disappeared you get we put it on ultra slow motion on the clips I'll try to show it here you can see his mouth when the arrow disappeared you can see the flesh in his mouth well and when that arrow goes in his mouth his whole body would make all four legs buckle up to the side he spins around the air wasn't sticking out the back you know the angle I figured that era went straight down his throat perfectly look at Lucas spins around takes off and that error was not sticking out the back of his neck wasn't sticking out the side of his neck that arrow disappeared square in 90-degrees head on straight down the pipe down his throat and disappeared with his mouth closing behind the fledging unbe liebe bull now he gets to the pond what did you at the pond he goes like this who spits my air out really without the broad head and he's still alive like how the hell does that even happen so back go back went back home again we're pretty beat up I think I took the kid moose hunting somewhere else the next day it's eating me alive I'm like eh I'm going back up there it's not easy to get there brought me nephew with me we go up did the exact same route got on the top this time I got my 300 sharp mag going along the top tell him his roar shot it right here we walked right through the pass or a shot on my bow got another 50 yards up from Cal calling all sudden behind us I hear this oh I turn around here's this freaking ball boom dumped him we go over there he's got a perfect cut on his shoulder that had fallen open that wide there's that long it's like three days old right I stole her I saw that and we're alike to you and Frick I was doing like freaking cartwheels yes got'em yes thank God recovery we got him we got him back oh my God thank God I got him yes chop them all up hike back out when God the horses the next day Oh went back out looked at the bull on the video that I shot down the throat two different frickin moose two different record book Bulls what like you got to be frickin kidding me now here's where it gets even crazier so  my friends uncle who lives up there up north has a bush has a point he decides he's gonna go flying that day that we're taking the horses in to go get the moose and he flew over top of us and he flew all the way down the top of that hog back that run spins around came back flew out we packed him this out and then he comes over and he goes hey let me see that video that moose he shot in the mouth I showed it to him he goes that guy was on the far end of the mountain with four cows down there looking up at the point like no way serious he goes that's the bull that's him yeah he's dead he's out the other under three cows so I had to go back home this is way up to Alaska Highway I had to go back home in a couple days the next day so I told my buddies to go get that boost manly go get him and they did go back back there but I never found him and then I had left to trail cameras up there and I was gonna leave him there all year and come back get him the next year right and guess what if I didn't capture the bull that I shot down the throat on two different trail camera clips over a month later and you can see him right here and he is absolutely fine  explain that one how the hell did that happen seriously seriously so that's sucker eight and arrow and a broad head straight down the pipe full length you can see in the video closes his mouth as soon as the flesh disappears down there takes off whap spits my arrow keeps on going it goes up chases cows around a month later he's still healthy as anything running around he's fine he left just explain that one that's gonna be one of my biggest hunt mysteries ever for the rest of my life unbelievable  huh stories", "Ex1dbF73N8E": "", "jX2QbrRFZ-A": "how do I pronounce your name colione nor Kohli on yeah okay yeah now there's a conspiracy out there okay I made this name oh yeah we'll talk about that we're talking about we're live ready how'd you do that so quickly oh you're a wizard what's the conspiracy about you and your name is Kohli Anwar yeah what's the conspiracy about your name that I made it up to hide who I really was oh yeah a type yeah like like everybody gets to have like pseudonyms except for me when you're talking about guns you don't get to have pseudonyms did you have a different name yeah my name is Collins oh okay so you did change your name yeah I did but there's a conspiracy behind you changed your name but that's not real you just decided you wanted a different name I got in the guns and I wanted to start watching gun videos and so I wanted to make a youtube channel and I didn't want to use my real name because I thought that wasn't cool enough it's all right so it's not your name wasn't cool no I didn't touch a a freaking American thing yeah I mean I know comedians who change your names like earthquake you don't know earthquake is fucking hilarious comedian man he's hilarious but a white dude couldn't call myself earthquake okay good no you could but nobody wrestler those were named earthquake that's different yeah that's different that's probably a big giant guy right so what's your original name what's your actual full original name I'll give you my first name I'll just I just don't wanna make it easy for people to show else Collins bouncing around it yeah cold the way it's a fine name something wrong with that name I wasn't the wrong with it why'd that name bother you to the point where you didn't want to have it on no I just you just thought it'd be more fun to just come up with a pseudonym for my youtube channel like I didn't start my youtube channel thinking all right I'm gonna start this channel and I'm gonna build this whole brand box right no who's just one is for fun yeah my friends call him one of my friends he called me killer calling all right that was a kind of little nickname that I had and so I was like okay well just use going on and then I'm like I'm always in black why did he call you killer colleano idea just talk to him to this day and I still don't know why he called me that yeah there's nicknames man that just happened sometimes there is a rapper in Houston by the name killer colleano yeah okay yeah so I don't know if maybe he listened to him and in my name Collins and so forth and so on yeah so so how did you get wrapped up with the NRA so we should kind of we should cover a couple of things here in the origin story yeah so you're kind of like a spokesperson for the nrn not official spokesman out official unofficial no today you are a member of the NRA do they recognize you do they appreciate you like how does that work okay so the way it started do you I mean I'm gonna start from the beginning okay alright so I had a friend of mine a good friend of mine who called me up one day and was like do you want to go shooting and I was like oh cuz that time I were really wasn't pro-gun and this was about I was around 23 old Ian Ayre for I'm 34 so this is 10 years ago yeah and I hesitated a little bit because my background growing up like I didn't grow up with guns in house no one in my family had a gun and for me the idea the notion of being a young black male with a gun it's always I don't saw it the exactly through the lens of you know gang banger drug dealers so forth and so on so that's the mindset I had with respect to firearms unconsciously right I didn't even realize it was even conscious of it until I started getting into this very heavy and realize okay wow I was thinking like that didn't realize it and so but at the same time I told myself  why am I afraid of essentially what is an inanimate object right so I think to myself am i all right I really don't want to go I'm a little terrified but you know what I'm gonna go ahead and do it and so I remember getting to the range we get to the range and we walk into the door and then I hear the door for where the actual bays are and I hear a pop pop pop go off and my holy crap this is actually happening and so I kind of had this nervousness but I'm with my friend right and so I don't want my friend to feel like okay you're acting kind of like a bitch alright hmm so I kind of kept it to myself you get to the counter we do all the paperwork that you know requisite paperwork like building phones all that and he has his gun we get some ammo we go to the lane I remember as a very last Lane it was a lady the range was Top Gun in Houston and so we go to a very last range he gives me kind of like a brief instruction about how to shoot the gun how to load it so forth and so on and so at that point I remember picking up the gun terrified not knowing what to expect not knowing what was gonna happen so I remember picking it up it was a little Taurus PT 1151 11 millenium in 40 caliber and this was a subcompact probably not the best first time shooting a fucking gun well the gun itself a small caliber example yeah okay exactly so my experience if anybody who watched that as a gun person would be like ah this is not gonna end well so I remember standing at the bay and in taking the gun and pointing it and shooting it and I remember just the concussive force the explosion with the gun dancing in my hand and I was like holy crap that was terrifying then I shot it again and the weird thing is it not in a way that most people think the nerdy aspect of my brain kicked in right I'm like holy crap like I'm taking this project down and I'm launching it right several feet and I just because the the second shot allowed me to realize what just happened I just contained an explosion in my hand right I'm like if you don't find that amazing you know I'm a pulse it's amazing the thing that people are bothered by is what comes with it and how people use it mm-hmm and I think an analogy that's a fair analogy but people reject is driving cars and a lot of these fucking psychos that have been running over people in the street I mean it just happen again Berlin yeah what somewhere somewhere in Germany some guy ran a bunch of people over and then blew his brains out it's it's an object right it's a thing that you use and I'm a huge car guy to say him as well yeah yeah I love cars I mean if someone said we have to ban cars because people started running people over with cars maybe like okay I think we're dealing with a whole bunch of problems and there's there's a bunch of things that I think we could probably agree on one of the things we can agree on is all these mass shootings are horrific absolutely they're terrifying it's it's an evil terrible thing that here's another thing no NRA members are doing that that's one of the things that's really kind of fucked up about people getting angry at the NRA yeah we've never had a mass shooting ever like that that I can recall that was done by an inter remember I looked I tried to find them I can't find a mass shooting that was perpetrated by an M RN R a member and I think it's so the biggest problem that a lot of gun owners especially NRA members have is people like the conversation that's being had is basically coloring or actually forgetting the human element behind those three letters mm-hmm like the NRA isn't like this demigod that just sits in a cloud of Olympia and it's just one big guy that just it's orchestrating this entire thing yeah it's you're talking five million people you know all right like I'm I'm I'm a member I'm a gun owner right that that's who I am along with million other people who are that way and then there are a ton of other people who think they're honorary members in art and then a ton of other people who probably don't mind being in RA members they just haven't got around we're doing it and getting a membership yeah and the vast majority of those people and I'm saying that just to be safe they're good people I think there's quite a few good people the people that have perpetrated all these mass shootings are definitely not good people but what's wrong with them well I'll tell you what's not wrong with them guns it's not guns that are wrong with them they use the guns to express what's wrong with them you know and everybody wants to look at the object which I get what's easier well it is easier and it's it's something that everyone's pointing to like why do you need an ar-15 why do you need of this well I needed that these are good questions why do you need these things why do I need that fucking samurai sword over there I don't yeah you know it's like what do you need yeah okay and that's another thing too though like and I've said it before I think we are a victim of our own success in this country right I do think this is the greatest in the world but the problem with that is is this country was built on an ideological foundation that I think it aids in that our ability to be as great as we are but we live in the world now where people don't see the necessity for something that was never predicted that was never supposed to be seen through the lens of necessity in the first place the Second Amendment doesn't give me a right it preserves something that already existed but what happens is we have a culture of people who don't who look at the second women as a privilege not a right they look at as a privilege so that's why they say well why do you need that well why do you need more than 10 rounds why do you need this why do you need that and I'm like first of all we're framing the entire conversation under need when that's not what the Second Amendment is about it's a right that I've already had it's a natural right that I had the moment that I stepped foot on this earth as a person the right to self-defense is universal yeah and the you know people say okay it's a right but obviously there's a problem so we have to do something about it so you're gonna have to give up your guns this is this is the common conversation and it's very flippant and it's not well thought out and there's no consideration whatsoever to mental health issues I think this is purpose I think that's the primary problem I that's I've been saying this from the get-go I think it's the primary problem I think it's a mental health issue and people say oh that's simplifying it I don't think it is I think it's the opposite I think it's it's ignored yeah look it's a there's something wrong when you have this many people on mental health medication and then when you look at the number of mass shooters it's almost universal almost every single one of them is on some sort of psychiatric medication but that's not a part of the narrative that's not a part of the conversation the conversation is always get rid of guns now I don't want crazy people to have guns I don't think you do either no I don't so outside of taking away the rights to have guns from normal law-abiding people like yourself and myself I have guns what what do we do okay so first of all I think we need to frame the conversation and into specifics right you're a lawyer right I am okay yeah so you understand and bills and amendments and law okay yeah and so I think one we're lumping the entire conversation in one category right if we're gonna talk about school shootings let's talk about school shootings okay right so first thing I say is because first one thing a lot of people in this I'd like to say is well you guys you just don't want any any gun laws and you say no everything but you have no so that's true but to stand up for that it's because all they want to do is take away the guns yeah they're saying let's take away the guns you're saying we're not gonna take away the guns you guys just don't want to get your guns taking away yes you're right right no one wants to get their guns take away and I get labeled a monster as a result of saying exactly you want kids to die and it's it's a fucking real sneaky conversation it's disingenuous yes it is and and that's and then the odd thing about it is it's you anybody who's paying it into the discourse in a way is happening especially on social media right anybody who follows my Twitter my Twitter account knows this multiple occasions I've tried to have a rational conversation with people who are on the complete opposite side of my spectrum of this issue is there any of this online they're like debates range like that well no I mean it's just on Twitter tweets going back and do anything people being friendly you want to see me flustered yeah respond to me rationally well because I'm always you know I have this right and I actually have to check myself about that a little bit because how am i any better than the people on the other side if I have the same if I have the same energy that they have towards me that's a very good point and so I've started you know what let me cuz I can be incredibly snarky yeah like I can and it's partly due because of my friends they're all assholes like all the friends I grew up with I grew up arguing with a group of guys who when they were losing it logically they went to jokes right all right it was like a man it took me a second to realize it because I was the one in law school right I was the one that was going to law school real all that stuff so everything I did was focused on Senate good idea logic logic logic you're not making any sense and you know crack a joke and then everyone's laughing and that realized there's some power to that right you know what humor you should know something about that yeah for sure and so I took on some of those qualities in the way that I advocate for firearms hmm you know because it can be a little disarming but the disarming aspect of it could be beneficial because it causes people to drop their guard a little bit right and then when you drop your guard you can take in information more objectively more so than waiting or looking for confirmation bias or instigating your cognitive dissonance because you just don't want to hear the thing that can't that's contrary to what you already believe I just think you need a lot of character like as a person to be able to communicate reasonably on Twitter yeah and there's a lot of people that are just lacking that so it's almost like the ability to steal and no one's looking the ability to shit on someone with no eye to eye contact no social repercussions no you know you're not feeling anything from that person you say something rude to them they're not in front of you so don't feel terrible saying it yeah no it's it's a lie so Twitter is a dirty place but it's a great place to sometimes it is it has its benefits I think there's some really good conversations to be had on Twitter and I've had really interesting moments on Twitter where I've learned a lot about things where people sent me links and I've retweeted them and I've learned a lot of things but it's it's hard sometimes man because there are so many people that are just unreasonable and they're not good at communicating and they're not happy they're not happy people not there's a lot of people out there that just aren't happy man it's you know and it'd be honest with you I didn't realize it until I got to the notoriety that I am now in the space that I'm in well you're in a weird space yeah because you're in the space of defending guns no and I'm black yeah and I'm relatively young yeah it's a lot going on there and we're a lawyer and I well they disregard that well well it doesn't matter because I have I'm doing I'm advocating also with certain three letters behind me and then they automatically assume as the devil how does it NRA feel about you do you know I mean do you have conversations with them are they saying good or they are they please door I mean as far as I can tell they are yeah you know we still have the relationship we have it's very much a very symbiotic relationship it's a weird one right now because it's like this is what I hear from the NRA I hear kolyan and then I hear Ted Nugent  [Music] III gotta be honest I'm not I'm not the biggest fan of Ted Ted Nugent's rhetoric but I do know where it's coming from but then again I didn't grow up listening to Ted Nugent yeah that's not my demographic Nugent is still an individual and people fell to understand that like we like we may be monolithic on that only issue of firearms we're not monolithic in the way we go about expressing it well he's right about things yeah you know just because someone's outrageous doesn't mean they're not right like have you ever seen his thus the debate that he had in a gun store with Piers Morgan yeah no the funny thing is that dude is incredibly bright hey smart guy crazy hell I don't even think he's crazy I do listen you can only you can only kill so many things where you lose your fucking marbles Ted lives on a fucking ranch in Texas where it's all fenced in he's just shooting all animals he hunts every day he's a psycho and I don't without due respect I'm a big fan of stranglehold so what so how what's where's the line of demarcation between comic Regis honey so much and not hurting enough in terms of becoming its crossing over that line into into sociopaths well I'm just joking - I'm a hunter I mean it really depends entirely upon what he's doing with the meat and I know he gives it to hunters for the hungry I know he gives it to neighbors and and friends and there's nothing wrong with that and he asks he actually has he has an obligation to be the steward of his land because he has a lot of exotics and stuff and I'm just totally joking around oh no I know but when you listen to his conversation with Piers Morgan which Piers Morgan takes that flippant left-wing knee-jerk reaction Airi you know really arrogance yeah he's a content and when he's on with Ted Ted just knew everything about the actual facts when you start running around with statistics of gun violence he's like do you know how many of those people were bad guys that were shot by cops there do you know how many of those people were people that were shot when they were breaking the people's homes do you know how many those people were people that were killed in self-defense yeah there's a lot yeah it's not and do you know how many those people when you say talk about gun violence how many as people were suicide yeah there's a lot keep in mind that's recent suicide well no so here's what happened so when I started getting really deep into the advocacy component of it everyone was screaming 30,000 people day die from gun violence 30,000 people today that's what they were running with right and they were scaring all the suburban house moms oh my gosh we got to do something about gun control we got to do something about guns so I jumped into the pool and I just like something doesn't seem right about that figure right I'm not saying I'm gonna do things wrong about it it seemed inflated it seemed too late I don't know what it was it's on a subconscious level and maybe or maybe it was me looking for confirmation bias right because I felt the way I did about fires I'll be honest and say that right and so what I did is I kind of just a little more and I realize holy over 65% of that 30,000 suicides 65% real yes Jesus Christ so what is that like eighteen thousand people a day shoot themselves man something crazy like that what do we say at the top of the show man people are miserable man that's a fucking crazy number though man that's a Kevin Hart concerts yep pretty much all together good night everybody blam well that's really what it is 18,000 people dad that's fucking incredible so then it but then it begs the question that you brought it before the mental health aspect yeah how much how much how many lives would we actually save if we took the same energy we applied to just making guns evil and trying to ban guns and to take that energy and put it towards understanding what it is why as a society we have a society that is so eager to really not want to be here anymore hmm expand that a little bit more because we have all the guns in the universe here in America right compared to any other country but yet our suicide rates should be seemingly higher than all the other countries that don't have as many guns but it's not the case right you look at the UK you look at Japan Japan has double our suicide rate does it really oh yeah double yeah wow so sixty thousand people a day in Japan or whatever the fuck per year smaller did I say you earlier a day yeah yeah cuz you know thirty thousand yeah what'd I say a day thirty thousand a year doesn't sound that bad there's 300 million people oh yeah so you would think about it predicated on on a daily basis no no no annually annually yeah yeah that doesn't make any sense why would I think that I think you might have said on an accident - oh really yeah everyone 31 yeah thirty thousand three thousand a year gun violence they call it gun gunfire right right but in reality you break those numbers down sixty percent of suicides and about five percent of those are goddamn it I think justified homicides including times when cops shoot someone in self-defense and it's justified right and self-defense shooting so forth and so they count times when cops really shouldn't a shot somebody but did I'm pretty sure they do yeah yeah I'm pretty sure they do but even then that number would be exceedingly marginal comparatively right so then you have the remaining number which are and then you have like three to five I know I think was 15 percent are justified three to five percent are accidents three never ever since a lot you notice the 900 people nine hundred people a year right so and I tweeted this I said again if we focused on firearm safety education we could that number would drop in half it might you're not gonna you're not gonna fix the intelligence level of the humans these are fucking around with gun that's why you underestimate the fact in the understimate how those people are dying as accidentally okay because there are a lot of people who don't understand basic gun safety right within that nine hundred a lot of them when you see some of the accidents that happens with firearms they're easily mitigated by just simply knowing the four rules of firearm ownership and when you get into the gun community like as a whole you follow that rabbit into like we are we're crazy about gun safety you you you put your finger on a trigger in a picture we're slaughtering you yeah not literally but you know what you said yeah like we're gonna hold your account I have a friend who has so many guns he doesn't know how many guns yes I said Mike how many guns yeah I don't know Justin he's a legit gun nut and and great guy yeah and I don't know how many times I had either right fucking crazy person I mean again I didn't shoot my first console at 2320 right yeah so then did i just become crazy i think i was about the same age yeah well i think I shot one when I was really young and I definitely shot one in camp when I was like I guess I was probably 12 yeah but at that I didn't count that I shot my first handgun when I first came to California and I might have been really yeah well what's ironic is it's way easier to get a gun here that it is in New York I lived in New York it's fucking hard to get a handgun in New York almost impossible you mean here was easy legally you mean yeah legally illegally okay yeah Wow no I mean when I came here it was 1994 mmm I guess maybe is 93 94 I bought a gun and I was like can't believe I just buy a gun he just did a check yeah yeah I bought a about 38 special I bought a Walther PPK and I bought a Glock 9-millimeter all right man if it tastes I'm a fan of PDK as well yeah it's a cute little gun well when I first came to California at her all his crazy shit about drive-by shootings gang violence I just thought it was just gonna be a fucking war zone out here I maybe missed a funny thing about it is it's your natural disposition was I need something to protect myself yes it's such a natural thought process I don't know why we've perverted it to this deal where it's like something has to be wrong with you if you had that mentality or that much well there's a lot of people that haven't experienced real violence you know and then if you experience real violence and you've seen what happens when you have a terrible person around people that aren't terrible mr. Schurr there's that's of reality that people don't like to face and they don't like to look at the other side of the coin like whenever there's an instance where there's a shooter and the shooter gets taken out by someone who's a trained a person is trained with firearms and and knows tactics nobody wants to talk about that that just gets brushed off they don't there's not a balanced conversation to be had there isn't and if what an interesting being is like I have a group to have a group chat when stuff like that does happen they write it off as just anomalies how's that an anomaly that's what exactly what it's supposed to be usable but again like I said confirmation bias and cognitive distances are is a bitch right we all suffer from it right to an extent for sure um but when you add in the component of fear right for a lot of people they don't necessarily hate guns the consequence is being shot or someone they love being shot exactly and one of the thing about it is though you know those people never put themselves in a position of being the shooter right they always put themselves in the position of being the victim of a shooting so that's why you get well why do you need that because they don't see it as okay this allows me to better defend myself right they look at it from the perspective of well if you're able to have that then you might use that against me there's that and you know there's also the looming specter of the mass shooter it's just so fucking common these days he's not every three or four months there's a new instance how many times does that happen perception is a bitch okay so the reality is the absolute reality is they have happened there are horrific and there's more of them here than anywhere else in the world that's reality but here's so when you say that you're talking about the developed world correct you're because that's usually the caveat they like to plow there's no mass shootings in the undeveloped world there's people don't just go into a fucking mall and shoot people up with switches you know it's very rare where people think it happens more than people realize just think about it how many people died on Chicago in the weekend over a weekend it doesn't get reported that's true but then we live in America well show complete access to information that is true but it's a different kind of violence because it's people that are actively trying to get people that are actively trying to get them it's gang violence whereas school shootings are complete innocent school shootings are the worst right because it's a child and some fucking psycho decides to make the most noise possible by going into a school and shooting it up that's the scariest and the worst for most people formerly when you think about gang violence you say well that's violence it's terrible that people got shot but it's people that are trying to shoot each other alright so then when I tell you that the remaining homicides in this country right we're at thirty thousand number that I gave you manually over 80% of that is gang violence that's crazy to think about yeah no I believe you but it's when you see Sandy Hook when you see parkland when you see any that's the shooting in Colorado Aurora in the movie theater when you see these mass shootings these are what terrify people yeah people are not necessarily terrified of the gang violence in Chicago you know I'm going to Chicago in a couple of months and and not one fucking person has brought up hey man a place of warzone everybody's like I love Chicago you're gonna get deep-dish pizza like nobody's your life is that what it is yeah no I'm not going to South Side dude see that's the thing I just went to Chicago was just in Chicago I was here and they were like what you locked and loaded did you wear a vest yes I got all those questions but I said I was going to Chicago those are the first things people told me now granted I did go to Southside I did Tillman's I said yeah we would you were you nervous well yeah I was nervous I'm not Superman like when you're walking around he's trapped not in Chicago because it's illegal for me to be that's what's crazy is Chicago has really strict gun laws and that they don't work at all I was driving down a road where there were like six seven eight dudes who jumped in front of the car won't drive that because we didn't look like we belong there and I'm positive every single one of them had a gun they jumped in front of the car well didn't like who lob their bodies in front of the car but you know you see a cop it's unfamiliar driving down a side street so they try to stop you they didn't try to stop me I think they're trying to figure out who the hell we were got a board or they were just trying to serve us oh yeah yeah so it's kind of one of those things right but then again when you're driving around you driving down the side sweet soy sauce Chicago but GoPros on the car that's right so you kind of have that I'm so we all agree that gun violence especially in terms of mass shootings is one of the biggest problems that we have in terms of like a horrific public image problem right it's a it's it's something that you see in the and everyone on what I say public image I should what I should I should rephrase that what I mean is like public perception problem like you see it and it's just death and violence and children and innocence and we as as people I think consider the death of innocence to be one of the most egregious and horrific deaths absolutely I think we both agree on absolutely so so that's a hundred percent across-the-board I think with any decent person these mass shootings are horrific I think in my opinion the the number one aspect of the argument that's not being discussed is the mental health aspect of it are you opposed to more screening of people to get guns yes and no yes and no yeah okay yes in that in an ideal world if we could minority report it and figure it out I mean Minority Report I mean just like check to see if they're on mental health medication but I mean we we currently will see it here's the thing the slippery slope with that - mm-hmm so what would constitute somebody being home into health medication that's prohibitive what if I what if I deal with anxiety if I'm on zann's prescribed does that prevent me from owning firearms it's a good question in California for the longest time they were trying to make it if he had a medical marijuana card you couldn't have a firearm I think they were doing that federally I think there was a federal thing that if you had a legal medical marijuana card that they were trying to prevent people they were trying to prevent people from they were trying to try to cripple the marijuana gaucho industry because they knew that people want it done because because to be honest it's it's intellectually dishonest if I can if I can go to the store with a gun on me and buy alcohol right like in you know me I don't even smoke right right but let's just be honest about it like alcohol weed I mean I think utilizing that as a prohibitive means to own a firearm I think is I think that is true but if you were under the influence some of the shit I got in this studio you've been super paranoid think I didn't say I didn't say under the influence I said if I could all the all the marijuana card does is allow you to buy it no hundred percent but I'm saying that is an issue if you're under the influence and you have a gun mmm right yeah but I'm allowed but I have you go to my house where I have all types of whiskey's at home right but if you're under the influence right yeah no I can't I can't carry a firearm in the trunk right you can't you shouldn't be drunk with a gun you shouldn't be high as fuck with a gun neither one of those are good ideas nor should you be driving right nor should you be driving so should you be on xanax with a gun that's a question I don't know the answer to because I've never had xanax exact me neither I don't know what it's like but I do know that there's been people that have killed people when they were on xanax and you know that guy in Vegas this the shooter in Vegas that guy was on and anti-anxiety medication I didn't know that Chris Cornell was on anti medica anti-anxiety medication when he killed himself look it's got a profound effect on some individuals and it's no it's not uniform the way it affects you it might affect change different it's just it's a different I mean I know I know tons of people who are on it yeah I do yeah and they they respond like you said they respond to it differently yeah yeah and I know tons of people on it will also drink while they're on it which you're not supposed to yeah yeah and that that's not good either yeah what's so screening with the screening component right you've got to be careful because what it does it's like it becomes a de facto way of preventing people to own firearms apparently right so it's like oh well you have anxiety or even even somebody who's maybe dealing with PTSD right not everybody dealing with PTSD is a potential murderous ravenous hunter person who driving about and kill people so with the screening component that's why I say yes or no right if you can find a way if you can find a way to establish a skrub a mental screening it but even then no because there's a desert there's a due process aspect to it as well right so you can't prevent me from owning and you can't prevent me from exercising right if I haven't done something to absolve myself and being able to do that legally right okay so what if they come to your house and you've got let's say you've got like a cork board up and you've got all these pictures of schools and fucking arrows pointing to the emergency exits and plans of how to block things off and then pictures of Jodie Foster and pictures of serial killers up everywhere and you're on anti-anxiety medications and the cops talk to you and your fucking squirrely as hell you haven't done anything now yeah arrest me then if you can't arrest me arrest Kant what if you can't arrest me for but for crime or possibly attempting it because like like in Italy like the legal standard is like taking substantial Act mm-hmm to commit a crime even though you don't do it that's attempted right did you hear about the kid that got kicked out of school what was the school he was an Asian kid dyed his hair blonde started collecting bullets got a semi-automatic rifle his friends started freaking out they called the cops cops came to visit him he bought another rifle and I believe they deported him they deported him for reasons not having to do with the firearms they deported him for reasons that he wasn't going to so many more green card oh but the way the sheriff's were framing it was they deported it because they wanted this fucking psycho out of the country and they think that they might have prevented a crime they probably did but my still had they still had to establish a legal basis for deporting it but they did all they had was that that he didn't go to class yeah I mean that that's something you've done I've done yeah yeah I mean everybody was but then again he wasn't a citizen right so now was that was that was a requirement for him to continue to be here but it was really was kind of like Al Capone you know I got on Capone my tax evasion right by way of you know right right right but he really had guns and was acting crazy and that's why the kids that were friends with him called and that's why they acted and they just found that loophole yeah so what do you do with someone like that other than I mean this guy we had something what if this kid was still going to school I mean it be pretty bad yeah well you bad but but then again we still we still have our loss for a reason right we have we have our inherent rights for a reason we have to do process for a reason because if we didn't have those right anyone could just come up and say man you know what I saw I saw call you on the war on Instagram the other day he posted a picture of a gun didn't he was like cursing people out because they're making fun of him in the water he was drinking and so you know what's my needs to go check on him and make sure he's okay right and some I need to go and take his guns away from him right you've got it was there's got to be due process I appreciate that yeah I agree with you and and it's it's unfortunate in that some people may slip through the cracks but but I can't arrest someone for something that they haven't done yet Brian you just you just can't well I agree and so that's where we are right now so then so they're not now we're getting to the complexities the hard hard questions right what do we do how do we put something in place to catch the people who do happen to fall between the cracks all right so then you go okay well sorry I move a lot of yeah I'm like Hydra the complexities yeah it's it's a very complex issue which is why we're not largely not having it we're having it here because no one wants to have this conversation on the national scene because it's hard and it doesn't make for great sound bite and it doesn't make a good TV mmm right because I hate doing cable news hits because I have two minutes to to basically deduce a complex issue that we've been debating for decades almost centuries it's the worst and it's also people talking over each other and there's one you know they have two boxes one guy here one guy there usually you're not even in the same room together you're talking through those earpieces is a delay those things are a disaster horrible is one of the worst ways to communicate which is why I tried to establish my platform of my shona waar mm-hmm I tried to have it as a platform that's open to people to come on hey look you want to come on and discuss this issue by all means come to it have you had anyone that's that's like really strict anti gone yeah on yeah I had I had an entire season so what we did in the season I think it was two seasons ago we brought on I was a young lady and from New Zealand I can't remember but he came on the show they were anti and so what we did was he had a roundtable discussion at the end of every episode of my show and we bring up a specific topic and we discuss it and so then basically was like two against one essentially mm-hmm and so they would talk to me about what their thoughts on on what we talked about in the show or a particular gun control issue and we had that conversation I had an individual I sit down with her as well when we talked about and then took her to the shooting range to shoot for the first time hmm you know but that's going to be overlooked right they know they ignore it well they probably aren't even aware of it cuz I wasn't aware of it another aware of it he's people who need to be aware of it oh we're okay because like for instance I bring this point up in makes me come across as if like I feel some type of way because he didn't mention me but it's not really that it just speaks volumes to what I've been pointing at for the longest they ignore rational discourse John Oliver did a 20 minute monologue on NRA TV about NRA TV right 20 minutes mm-hmm you know how long a 20 minute long yes that's a long yeah he didn't mention me once he didn't mention my shot had three shows on NRA TV three shows and I had the second longer longest-running show on in high t-v he didn't mention me once the level of detail that they went into within that monologue lets me know they watched everything on that platform okay they watched it all and why do you think he left you uh because it fit the narrative right also because he is a progressive guy with glasses who's white and you really shouldn't you really shouldn't say anything negative about black people how so but he's not white though he's a minority just like me what is he he's I don't know he's like he's white what is he then if he's not white I'm not white what the fuck  Irish Irish yeah my white if I'm not what the fuck is about sorry on the street your wasn't my grandparent white yeah my grandparents came over that guy's white he's white like paper time is it yeah oh shit I'm wrong well there you go um what did you think I don't know I never thought I'm confused with the Daily Show guy I'm probably an Trevor Noah you know that's right but no but I know about Trevor you know right yeah he's white his fuck he's a white Englishman man I'm racist but for a guide like that guys like that have they've here's the thing about progressives and I like John I'm not I'm not negative against John doing a show I have I had this perspective up until this point so I'm gonna shut off I'm gonna shut off my belief system and listen to you and listen to what your let's say because I hadn't thought about this because I thought he wasn't white to his entire time oh yeah so now why his fuck um I mean it might not even Bob what be why he did it he might have found the worst examples and maybe you were too reasonable and it doesn't fit the narrative of being funny I mean his show although his show has points and he makes these very you know these clear conclusions and you know but it's funny it's a funny show yeah the whole thing behind it is that any any girl who's dating me knows like I have enough episodes on on on that platform you could find some stuff to make fun of me about well I'm sure they could but I don't think that's the kind of thing they're trying to make fun of like individual personalities that say stupid shit I think what they're trying to do is point out the disingenuous narrative from the NRA while ignoring the disingenuous narrative from the anti-gun advocates okay I could possibly see that I'm trying to I'm trying to be fair and reasonable because my mind wants to go now he saw he realized that by mentioning me right it's gonna it's going to peak curiosity with the audience in which he's trying to so you think we were too reasonable and too logical and that since you're not like this redneck hee haw type character that like to talk about you it doesn't fit their narrative so let's just ignore him yeah because that's a trade on the dummies think about it like they're still real though right dummies on all sides that's true that's true but it's pretty easy to find like pro-gun dummies you can find quite a few of them I can pretty easy to find dummies on other side as well sure yeah but you wouldn't be looking if you were on that side right if you're on the anti-gun side you're looking for Pro gum dummies pro gun dummies yeah pro gun dummies are easy to find they all right there's plenty of them right now you can go fucking find them on Instagram and Twitter and there's there's dummies all over the world you see here's the thing though the thing about what John Oliver does and that's the thing this is the kind of disingenuous nature of satire okay political satire it I call it the the the comedian plausible deniability card right okay so you can make a joke about something and then say oh it has no influence because it's just a joke it's not but he's not saying that is he he's not saying it doesn't have an influence what exactly he understands the influence at wields but he's saying but he can he can always swipe the plausible deniability card and say well no I wasn't making actual political statement like I know that there are reasonable people on the other side no you're pushing a narrative that has been pushed for decades about an organization that fights for the Second Amendment the same the same the same narrative that's being pushed by groups of people who say the only thing standing in their way of more gun control is the NRA so what do you do so where does anybody get his power from because they talk out of both sides of the mouth they don't get the power from there but they're uh sorry they don't use a power by their membership right right so what do you do you do your best to stifle that membership you make it seem as unattractive as possible and then you also your audience is already largely uneducated on the issue right and there's already this perceived notion that the NRA is just a bunch of racist white rednecks mm-hm right so they don't then what do you do to further that narrative you talk about their platform and then you pull out all of those things that further drive that narrative while ignoring the most popular figure on the platform which is you which is me and and so who so happens to be black so what does that say it tells me that this is that it was deliberate uh I really do want to agree with you and say you know what he's white he didn't want to be seen as attacking the black guy so forth and so I think there's a little of that but I think there's also he's doing a show let me let me explain how a show works he's got a team of writers there's a ton of people back there they are just trying to be funny they're trying to make points for sure but they're trying to find stupid shit that they can mock yeah and why would they concentrate on the guy who makes sense if they're looking for stupid shit that they can mock they're not trying to make a balance to reasonable argument like maybe we would do right here right now yeah what they're doing is doing a condensed edited down very smooth polished television show with that rent has been dissected and gone over by a team of writers and they have video that corresponds to it and photographs that they shoot go to and and they have clips that they show and they mock the clips it's a it's a comedy show all right do you have a point but it's a comedy show absolutely that's why they didn't go after you is because maybe you're a lawyer maybe you're articulate maybe you is because you're young and black and they just don't feel like it's a smart thing to do but it's because they're making a show I agree with you now let me tell you why my panties aren't a ruffle about it okay it's because I understand the influence of that show when people make political decisions but don't you think it's preaching to the choir that show would mean that would that show yeah John Oliver show I think if I had to guess how many people who are watching that show are left-wing leaning Democratic leaning liberal leaning I would say it's a giant percentage here's the problem though the number of people who come to me and say I don't I don't deal with the NRA because they're racist and they're a bunch of white rednecks who says that oh gotta get all the time where's the evidence that they point to they just assume what a racist yeah that's that's just it yeah cuz in their into in their attempts to just make a show right I agree with you wholeheartedly I absolutely agree with you but we can't undermine how influential that show is at crafting people's thoughts about particular issues and ideologies within this country right right and so I stand back and I'm like man this is dangerous because to me the Second Amendment is incredibly important right I don't you know what the funny thing is I thought the monologue was hilarious the mom's not funny dude mama my life is hilarious I'll give him the modeling was monologues funny funny dude because he said that funny he was a funny dude deer net 20 minute mom times he's not you're very mistake consistency consistency you give me some consistency I'll let you drop the ball a couple times here and there that's fine but as far as consistency tough job no China over guy it's got a tough judge I think it's an I think it's incredibly tough I think I think comedians don't get enough credit I'm not sure having a real comedian stand-up does John Oliver that is that is that the barometer for being of me comedians stand up for us okay yeah there's it's a big big difference I stand up to me terrifies me that the thought of ever having to like keep him on I'll get in front of a million people and talk all day long but the thought of stand-up see I get to cloak some of my humor in seriousness right so it's easier right I can do a little stuff here and there and like it's kind of funny well no it's only because it's contrasting against something that's serious and you don't expect the humor do you remember the way you felt before you walked into that shooting range and those guns were going off and you're like holy shit it's really happening yeah now think about how you feel now when you walk into the range like I go to the range yeah I go to the range all the time you know especially when I was rifle hunting I would go to the range at least once a month yeah and you know got used to it you go you hear the bang bang bang put your fucking headphones on you just walk up you say hi to everybody that you see there all the time everybody's super polite at the range that's one thing man people are polite as fuck at the range because everybody around you has the ability to kill you they're just not everybody around you especially when I mean I was in the rifle section I've got a 300 Win Mag door outdoors outdoors damn cannon yeah you know and everybody around yous got one of these things to everybody can kill everybody and everybody's like hey man how you doing what's up how's everybody doing everybody super friendly everybody can hands there's a mutual respect it's but it's interesting that's an interesting I mean that's so it's a weird statement that gets thrown about a lot of times that a well-armed society is a polite society then there were two times in my life where I felt really insecure the first time I carried a gun out of my house in my first MMA class yeah that makes sense but look what I was gonna say is when you go to the gun range a bunch of times then it becomes normal comes life that's what stand-up is gotcha same thing I mean he still can eat plates a dicks on stage okay go south and it's terrible it's where the worst feelings I made about Texas fucking dead-on and hilarious Oh were you there no I just thought which which bit were you basically about Bucky's or all the Lions yeah but the Tigers the Tigers Tigers in yard yes it's true and you basically talking about we need these people [Laughter] we're not fighting wars the people of Santa Monica that's true man that people who've never been to Texas do not understand that is the America of America we don't play no Texas doesn't play we are most arrogant sumbitches on the planet it's also like what when people think of America like overseas they think of like these fucking crazy people with guns that have jacked up trucks or to driving too fast the girls have big tits the guys are fucking crazy that's what we think of that's Texas yeah like that's not America now as a whole it's Texas is the most exaggerated form of it Texas houses the most exaggerated form yes well there's a lot of cool people in town yeah Texas is way more diverse my friend yeah Austin which is like super levin often is like california in texas but i think it's a little cooler gets smaller but it's the thing I said about about Texas that's true is there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in all of the wild of the world more Tigers in private collections that's fuckin true and when I read that I was like oh my god I have to figure out a way to make this funny that's the craziest fucking statistic I've ever heard in my life in people's yards like a lot of you I grew up though I grew up my entire life in Texas wanting a cheetah and the beautiful man a beautiful beautiful man with and just watching the funny thing is I get a cheetah and put it in and put it in the yard no bigger than this room and inspect to see the beauty of it running well you know it's all so fucked up I don't think you're allowed to like just feed them animals I don't think you're allowed to let loose a goat and have a how the cheetah tackle the goat and fuck it up I think you have to feed them meat you know like like already care process Wild Kingdom shit go down in your yard I don't think they allow them oh no you did say we only have three pages of law so yeah there's no three papers say no hate no chase shit about Tigers order dude you know you know funny thing about it is when I got into firearms I was in Texas my whole life and I went what 23 years without ever shooting gun touching a gun and when I got into it I started the first thing I wanted to do was shoot competition right and so you shoot competition you know do you do those competitions like John wick style where you go to three gun they call it three gun three gun yeah so basically consists of three different platform platforms a rifle shotgun and a handgun so how does this competition work so basically they just set up it's it's basically set up various courses where you have to utilize one of those three platforms some of the courses you utilize all three and so it's just it's just you're set to a timer you got to clear the course as fast as possible oh yeah and the clearing the course is are you is there like walls that you have to look oh yeah no yeah it's only limited by your imagination you ever see that shit where Keanu Reeves was preparing for John wick - yeah oh you were there I was okay so I was there not for that particular video that went viral but I was there one day when he was training and so I met him after the fact how is he different spacey Spacey yeah interesting but not in a bad way some very very calm energy yeah you know why why that's how he handles being that famous gotcha just shuts off I picked up on it immediately yeah and it wasn't it wasn't bad it was a it wasn't a bad thing was a good thing you got to realize he's the matrix guy yeah that's some over-the-top Fame he hit that Johnny Depp Tom Cruise level of Fame and then just became this super chill mellow guy that can just like go through crowds that guy goes sits on the subway by himself know like it's freaking awesome yeah but there's no obvious outward displays of wealth from him and he's insanely wealthy when you see him he's dressed like me yeah he's got like a regular watch on and sneakers he's normal as fuck man it's it's real weird like he's he's figured out a way to avoid like there he is right there I'm a fucking subway just chilling you know and he looks like a totally normal dude yeah well and people freak out they're like is that no can't be like people ignore him because he's figured out a way to just sort of just layer in plain sight and then even if you talked to him he's just normal like everybody that I know that's madam said the dudes like totally look at it he lets his chick sit down you know he said do you wanna sit down go ahead boom and he just stands up look it mean even the way it's not no bodyguards you know what's interesting about his demeanor and how like he doesn't have this sense of entitlement and I'm bringing it back bringing it back to the gun thing a little bit the first time I carried a gun I mean I told you those are two months the times where I felt more insecure was my first Damon Mme and caring gun for the first time like carrying that gun for the first time made me realize holy shit I'm not the only one right hmm so it actually humbled me and from the standpoint that knowing that you don't know who you're dealing with and when you carry a firearm on you you have the ability to go from zero to 100 like that and so you develop a respect for that also you start to develop a respect for life as well because you understand how fragile start the real is how fragile it is right and so for me I actually became more docile like I don't get road rage because because I understand and because I live in Texas you don't do that yeah no it's not but I also know that like there's so much responsibility that comes with carrying a firearm it's it's unreal and so for people who go out of the means to learn to do it and be able to do it like there's a certain level of respect you have to have for it because it comes with a lot the certain places you can't go certain things you can't do things you have to be cognizant of like so I started I actually started staying away from certain places because I knew I had a gun on me and I never want to have to be put in a situation I have to have to go for it no do you wear a gun all the time what if I can do it legally I am really yeah and what is the idea behind that is that like it's better to have it not to need it than to need it not to have it yeah it's it's an it's no different it's literally just a part of my routine watch.watch Keys phone wallet gun one in the chamber or no one in chamber oh yeah safety on the gun I usually carry doesn't they don't have external safeties it's just I I carry a holster so if you carry in the holster it shouldn't be an issue Wow yeah that's interesting yeah so you just want to be really really ready yeah we'll see you don't want to have touch no and see here's the thing that's that that's progressive I wasn't always like that I started off not caring with one in the chamber but when did you start putting one in the chamber when I started an understanding and trusting the mechanics of the firearm because when I started carrying I knew about guns I didn't trust the mechanics Brian right so you that extra step you don't feel like it's necessary of like no what do you mean in terms of like I just yeah well I understand that I understand so I started doing training right and I started training with guns and self-defense and stuff like that and I started realizing you know so the gun isn't isn't an end-all be-all right it's just a tool that I carry with me that could possibly save my life I could still die with a gun on me for sure but I started weighing the disadvantages and the advantages of having one in the chamber right I might find myself in a situation where you know what I have time to okay I'm a behind here and I have time to racket and do what I need to do mm-hmm there may be other times where I won't but if I already have around in a chamber those times where I will have the time and not have the time won't make a difference because there's already one in chamber ready to go yeah so from that perspective as I got more comfortable with the gun and realize holy crap the gun never just went off on its own because it was inherent fear there right it's like you don't want they're gonna go off while it's in your pants do you have like one of them Kydex holsters it's form-fitted yeah I have tons of all I have a box full house yeah because I review guns and reviewing gear and stuff so I'm constantly switching which is a gift and a curse because you know I never perfect any platform but I can you put any pretty much in in my head I can use instantly now when things happen whenever there's a mass shooting or something immediately people want to blame gun owners or people that want to protect gun owners and specifically NRA members this comes down on you sometimes this always it comes out of me people that want Gardens and people that don't want regulations and don't want you know additional screening yeah because you gotta think about it so like the figureheads when you and you start talking about Wayne and so they're people go after them clearly right but then also you have the personalities of the brand which is me Dana and Dana laughs Dana laughs right she's an official spokesperson right it's very nice lady I'm better exactly then you have ownership cam Edwards shows well exactly yeah and so what happens to happen is I get it a lot via social because that's how I built my brand mm-hmm right I put my band through social and so most people will when they can't descend like I don't think Wayne LaPierre has a Twitter page you know he doesn't have an Instagram account right so it's probably in a bunker somewhere  [Laughter]  well your but what you are is an interesting version of the NRA like oh this is the NRA too this is a kind of a new thing it's multi faceted like yeah if I dare anyone to go to the NRA annual meetings and then if you can I don't know how secluded it's go to the board meeting then you have a thinner air meetings you'll be surprised they have I have every race you can think of different sexualities you name it oh I believe you look I was in the NRA forever I just might let my membership lapse like a year and a half ago but I was in the NRA because I just felt like I know people that are just like we've got to get rid of the guns I'm like man I don't think that's gonna do it and I don't think that's gonna stop anything even if and I asked people this all the time I've done it on my show I called the big red button question right so you put a big red button and I'd ask them I put a big red button in the middle of table if you push this button all the guns on the planet disappear would you do it and now get various answers but I do it then people like why like why would you not happy the into violence might not real it's also the end of Defense exactly especially when you're talking about military I mean if you can't if you don't have guns like we're gonna fight with swords and bows and arrows and chefs you know the interesting thing about that too is only a lot of people are this I will say they were like why did the same people will say why do you need an ar-15 and then in an inverse when I say the Second Amendment is actually not about hunting it's about defending ourselves from a tyrannical government domestic or foreign they're like oh you think you little stupid guns are gonna be able to defend against the against the government I'm like well then why don't you give me the guns that the government has then and then they get quiet because they realize the contradiction and what they're stating well it's also the government when you say the government like protect us against the government we are the government the government is filled with people like the cops are us the problem is is this separation of us if you gave me a red button said would I could I end all senseless violence by hitting that button I would say yes and then when people say it's a guns promise do you know that London past New York City for the first time since 1800 in homicides and they did it with fucking knives with knives to the point where that goofball Mayor of London that dork on his Twitter page said there's no reason to carry a knife if you get caught carrying a knife you'll be prosecuted under the fullest extent of the law this is the fucking knife but I've got a knife the same country that the utilizes the shining example of what we should be doing in America exactly and they they have more murders in London from knives and here's a funny thing about that too you know like and so they have an uptick in acid attacks sorry I think well that's up that's the thing that people are doing - ex-wives and shit - yeah I mean is that is that is inhuman shit but it's also all this stuff it comes down to like what makes a fully developed person instead of looking at what's available - a fully developed person and what would allow fully developed person to commit horrific crimes what turns a person into that we should be looking at for the route fully-grown like what is the process that allows someone to become a mass shooter what's the process that allows someone to throw acid in someone's face man because I have you know clearly I have to frame everything to my perspective because you know I know it the best but like even for me like I said it in video before if I ever had to pull my gun and shoot someone to take a life I'm gonna I'm gonna need therapy yeah I am cuz because I value life that much I value it right did you have children no I don't let me tell you something man if you had a kid and some guy was trying to hurt your daughter and you shot him I think he'd sleep like a baby I you know what that just learning interesting you say that because when I talk to women about firearm ownership right like none of the girls no girls have ever been in relationship with we're like pro-gun right but over time you know dealing with me and when you walk into my house and there's five rifles on the table you kind of have to get acclimated but in dealing with women who start off initially as anti a lot of them talk about not wanting guns because they can't see themselves taking a life but the moment I asked them would they take a life to protect a child oh yeah I'm blowing that sucker away yeah you know and it's interesting how that works how we and I felt like I agree with you I'd be the same way exams and you know that whatever it is that turns a child into some monster that could shoot up a school I think that's what needs to be examined I mean and this is not a part of the narrative it's not a part of the discussions no one's bringing it up all people bring up is the event themselves their gun violence and we need to keep the tools away from people I just think the tools are one part of the problem I definitely think that you should width if there is a way we should figure out a way to keep Psychopaths from owning guns but how do you determine whether or not someone's a psychopath so they do some psychopathic yeah and then someone will talk about well you know Australia they had one mass shooting in the 1990s they took all the guns there's 18 people in Australia it's as big as the United States this is less mean not to mention crime went up after they did that did it violent crime went up when they did that that's when people don't want to talk about and and you're right like people forget contacts they're like two people in Australia what do you know what about there's one town in Georgia where firearm ownership is managed I do remember here when they made it mandatory and violent crime and everything dropped radically break-ins dropped radically they made it mandatory everybody has to have a gun and everybody was like fuck a crime I think about I need to find a new way to make a living because most dude like look most dudes who engaged in crime right of course you have your sickos who just love the violence right most of them just crimes of opportunity yeah all right so they're looking for victims they're looking for easy victims easy targets right if you know you're gonna deal with someone who possibly is going to kill you they don't want to die right which is why you've seen a lot of these videos with with these home invasions where you watch when the actual homeowner has a firearm once the shot start the bullets start flying they're gone yeah they're taking off the body once it gets shot right so and so it always boggles my mind when people are like whoa you don't need a gun for there so you don't need to go Mike no I do and they're like well the chances of you ever needing you know using it that's a stupid it's and it's incredibly Mirani sure this the chances are you've gone through life right now you however old you are when I'm talking to you you haven't been shot so the chances are 100% that you didn't need it right but that doesn't mean that's it's a crazy conversation I don't think the conversation should be about the tools I really think the conversation should be about what makes a person capable of doing that I mean if the conversation is what makes a person such a fucking nut that they have so many guns that they don't know what to do with that I mean you have so many guns you don't even know how many you have mm-hmm is that bad I don't know seem like a reasonable guy I'm not worried about you but even then I can only use one gun at a time I only have two hands I get that but the idea is like what if someone breaks in your house and steals your guns I'm sure you have been a safe but if somebody breaks in your house and steals your gun it's like what so that's my fault now that somebody want to break the law and break into my house no the idea is like access now you're giving access it's a very different argument exactly but you're still that fundamentally goes back to the idea that people want to undervalue this is a constitutional right yeah and so what we end up we find ourselves doing is finding ways to limit that right because of the few bad people in our country right you know and I just think that's the wrong way to go about it because we're basically weird evolving ourselves down to a point where when I can have any rights left because there are a couple of bad people who might do something bad with the rights that you have I think it's the wrong way to go about it too but if you if we had no violence in this country if something happened human beings evolved if our switch changed and there's no more violence would you still want to have guns yes you want to have them for recreation because you enjoy them yeah yeah that's something people don't want to hear yeah you're like I always tell people if you've never shot a gun if you've ever gone to a gun range you should probably should because it is actually fun it's fun now if you do that activity and you're not thinking about hurting someone and all you're thinking about is focusing on the target and trigger control all that stuff is that bad we do we do a thing on my show we call it athletic shooting right so my background before I got the guns was sports I was in the basketball football I ran cross-country track you name it so when I got in the gun so Mike my dream was to go to the NBA when I was younger right clearly that didn't happen and it wasn't going to but you know there was that that athleticism still in me so what we did on the show we were talking about coming up with a different shooting competition was how do I incorporate I thought how do I incorporate some an athlet athleticism into shooting right which is essentially by and large a lot of running and just shooting a different position so forth and so on and so when we're doing that I'm not thinking about shooting a person that's not the type of shooting I'm doing right doing target doing target shooting with some athleticism involved in it mm-hmm and so and people undervalue that like it's kind of like how can you not see that these are other ways that firearms are used which is why I started my brand too pewpew life right pew-pew life is predicated around he ewp for people don't understand that so people who use guns lie exactly firearm watch yeah and we're here doing hash tag pew pew yeah because I mean it's think about it when we were kids was all so simple right like cops and robbers with a gun pew pew pew pew we do that and so it but then so it I I want to capture the recreation involved in playing cops and robbers as a kid but then also understanding the very definitive and distinction between the good guys and the bad guys all right right the people who live this lifestyle are good people they enjoy guns for recreation they also understand that we live in a world where not everybody's good right right so we also own guns for our own self-defense and so it's a culmination of this lifestyle that comes together and we appreciate guns in a way that some people think is perverse but it but but how is it any less how is it any different than me obsessing over the Aston Martin DBS for the last 20 years that is that perverse it's still its little mechanical item yes the potential for violence is what what scares people yeah they mean when the guy kills 86 people in Nice with the truck right you mean it is a very good point and no one's trying outlaw trucks but it's this thing that we have in this country where we have more guns than we have human beings and that's that disturbs people yeah because they inherently vilify the firearm right which is why I have another hashtag that I call still waiting it's still waiting for what still waiting for my gun and jump upon it's only kill somebody hmm it's it's it is relatively tongue-in-cheek but at the same time what it does is it transfers the focus and in it I say when a drunk driver gets bought it gets behind the wheel and kill someone we don't blame the vehicle for it blame the driver right all right so when somebody goes out and commits violence with the firearm why are we focusing on the people who are doing it instead of focusing on a firearm well I think we should certainly be focusing on the people as we said we should certainly be focusing on focusing on what happens to a person that makes them develop into the type of person that can go into a movie theater and shoot it up like the Aurora Colorado let's talk about that a little bit because that the conversation that we don't have honestly and I'm not I don't have the answers um I can think of several things you know the easy answer for me is to say is it's our culture right we maybe have a culture that facilitates this or you know we have situation where there are people who do flip between the cracks and no one pays attention to them there's certainly some of that and I do think there is a line you can't write pay attention everybody you can't but then also I think there's like I was raised by a single parent mother right and my mother overcompensated when raising me because she understood the limitations of her being a woman raising a young man right so she was unnecessarily hard on me my mom has zero tolerance for my emotions absolutely zero so what she taught me growing up was how to deal with adversity taught me how to deal with failure how to get past those things taught me how to be self-assured and so what I think we were lacking to a degree in this country is people not having the coping mechanisms to deal with failure or to deal with the rejection you know some get it worse than others I agree it was definitely done there's definitely people that feel like they're Outsiders and they want to flip the board over they're losing the game and they just want to flip the board over and that seems like that Parkland kid I mean there were kids that were worried about him before this ever happened and that his whole thing was that his life was shit and he wanted other people to experience that yeah and in thing is it's like and the hard thing about it too is not realizing it just came to my mind I think sometimes I don't even want to talk about the mental health aspect of it in this particular case of the parking shoe because I just want to relegate him the evil right right because it pisses me off yeah like you're you taking innocent lies because you feel bad go on a corner and shoot yourself if that's the case there's a romanticized version of that to where people just want to take everybody out take all the people out that you saw that we're doing well while you were struggling there's that man but the world always flips man oh yeah like if it flips if you've got a good attitude you're a healthy person like yourself but if you're mentally ill and your life has been just tormented and abused and just your mental health issues and you're all fucked up it's I don't know what the answer is I mean you know what the answer is but I do know that the the problem lies in the individuals that are capable of committing that and how they become that because you got to make a great point he's got things like well mindset you have to be in a walk down a school hall and just shoot people shoot kid just shoot them it just innocently just now that's it's fucking gross you know whether it's Sandy Hook or what any one of these things like you have to be fucked up to do that like s and how many people are running around that are like three-quarters fucked up you only need a few bad things to go wrong and relatively speaking when you think about the fact that there's 300 plus million people in this country these are relatively relatively few people that they're capable in that actually act on such a horrific act but what do you think can be done to stop this stuff have you thought about it yeah I think about it all the time it's it's it's a harder question for me to ask them to come up with ways of why we don't need guns right you know because that's that's yeah you know it's hard especially when I'm taking gun control off the table because people are always saying you know you guys don't you guys don't want to move one inch well I was like yeah because we've been moving an inch for the last twenty thirty so the problem is it's a it's a fucked up argument because the people that are holding the guns are not necessarily the people that are doing these things you're trying to attack the the vast majority of gun owners are not committing crimes with their hands they're not so when I think about what can we do to stop different types of shooting for instance let's talk let's start with the let's start with what the type of shootings that happen to most Brian gang violence right so if you look at the statistics you think oh my gosh America's war zone right thirty thousand people you die in an in the vast majority of it that is remaining as actual homicides is gang violence so then we have a gang problem we have a gang problem in this country we have a socio-economic problem in very specific areas in this country right because I just came from South Side Chicago where I started in Hyde Park where Obama used to live and enjoy a few minutes into an area that looked like a bomb went off they don't have the violence in Hyde Park that they had in that area why they had the same access to illegal guns they don't have the same problem because there's a difference in economics and no one wants to judge when no one wants to address that right I'm a kid growing up in that neighborhood and I'm going to a school that shitty right I don't give don't give a damn about me I I lucked up and was able to go to good schools right I went to schools where my teachers care I went to schools where teachers pushed me when I was slacking off you know I had the ability to take out loans to go to a good law school you know I had those abilities if I'm a kid growing up in this environment and I can't find refuge in my school I can't find refuge at home because my mom's working three or four or five jobs so she's never there where am I gonna go find parents I'm gonna where am I gonna find that parent to influence let me fight on the streets so now I'm on the streets being led by people who grew up in exams that conditions that I grew up in and so now I'm like okay well I have to make money what am I gonna do for money well then there's the knock old economy very conveniently right there for me right so drugs so now I'm selling now I'm staying on the corner selling drugs I got to protect my product all right if I don't someone's gonna take it from me so what do I do I get a gun I carry a gun now I'm stuck in a situation in this violent loop right that feeds on itself and so now I'm stuck defending myself against the guy who's shooting at me trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting back at him maybe not because I'm trying to take his stuff but because he's trying to take mine all right so that's what you get that violence that comes from that from those particular areas now if we would've sat back and said okay we have hyper concentrated areas in this country this is a widespread it's hyper concentrated communities in this country that are dealing with this that are also the result of the vast majority of our gun violence if we sat back and thought about from a social economic standpoint how do we fix this what do we do how do we present opportunity I'm not saying gonna just hand out stuff but how do we fix this from the standpoint of improving our schools how does I can draw five minutes one direction and have a school that has everything you can name and then driving in a drive in the opposite direction as cool as can barely have textbooks to give to the kids hmm think about that yeah so why aren't we focusing our energy on building that up versus talking about all we need to get the guns off the streets you did that you have that in Chicago you have every gun law imaginable in Chicago but yet South Chicago still looks the way that it does still has a violence that it does right so if we would if we provide I mean you give people something lose or to live for they don't throw away life so easily plain and simple so it's nice socioeconomic status is in the dirt I don't have a problem looking at another kid down the street and shooting at him taking his life I don't have anything I don't have anything to lose but if we were to focus our attention in fixing that same way we talked about the mental health issue with respect to mass shootings then school shootings we wouldn't have to worry about the guns because we won't have people wanting to do those things or have the capability to do those things right so then that deals with that vast majority of the violence that we had there focusing that energy in fixing those communities I agree with you 100% and we've talked about this many many times in the show that I think that if you wanted to make America a better place one of the best ways to do it is to make it easier for someone to succeed make it easy and stop pretending that it's a level playing field because I didn't grow up in a level playing field I got lucky I did you got lucky a lot of people did and if you go to somewhere like the south side of Chicago and you don't realize that you got lucky you're you're blind then there's we if you want to what's the best way to make America stronger less losers less people who lose or how is that well give them more of a chance give them more of an opportunity and give them guidance ship community centers clean up the streets fix buildings but that's a lot of fucking money that we're spending right now in Afghanistan and Iraq and building missiles and all kinds of crazy shit that we're not putting any money into that but then who do we hold accountable we for friendly doing like like if we talk about the inner cities for instance mm-hmm they been democratically run for ages now the local leadership there is democratic right but there's no money there the problem is there's no money's going somewhere look I mean look at Chicago it's not enough I mean the money is going into the areas where people are wealthy and that's what they're supporting they're not supporting these impoverished areas and but then and you know what you're absolutely right so if that's the case and we all understand that and you know that stop someone just bullshit about gun control there but let's just say that that's just one one aspect oh no I'm good yeah I agree with you there so in that sense in when it comes to gun violence it's very complex when it comes to gang violence it's very complex and I agree with you that they need no other way to stop that then to fix the inner cities where people are just in that cycle of constant poverty and crime and that's all they see around them so it becomes normalized yeah absolutely so so now let's talk about mass shooting mass shootings all right so get rid of gun-free zones no one wants to hear that get rid of gun-free zones if you're not going to establish a perimeter outside of a building where I can go don't tell me I can't bring my gun in there a sign on the window was not stopping somebody from coming into the building we've seen a time and time and time and time again if the guns were the problems we would have mass shooting at every gun show every single day what we don't why the same reason you pointed out why'd that one that one place in Georgia when they said everybody had to have a gun crime went down people don't want to hear that though they don't want to hear that the answer to gun violence is everyone has a gun now not such a convenient answer for a guy like you is very convenient so many guns you can't count but here let's look at the alternative we've been living in it mm-hmm right right we acknowledge in that there's a problem right so why are we entertaining the fact that maybe that is the case right but do you think that like school shootings for example do you think that these teachers being armed would be the answer all right so or do you think there should be armed security on the campus I say it should be multi-layered right because if you if you really want to put things into perspective and inner I didn't add about this and people got pissed off but it's a truth wherever whatever school the president's kids go to they are guarded by guns right that school was protected by guns right right anything we hold valuable in this country is protective with guns no one is more anti-gun than Hollywood when you hear about any sort of crime or gun violence the left wing people in Hollywood are the most vocal the most virtue signaling the quickest to jump on their pedestal meanwhile what percentage of their fucking movies involve gun vine and if you look at the Academy Awards did you see the security at the Academy Award do you see all these left-leaning liberal actors being protected by people of flak jackets on carrying guns with fingers outside the triggers I mean dogs which it's crazy you know what it is though it's a loss of touch with reality well they're also insulated and protected well that's part of it because in her mind their mindset goes like this well I have security guards I mean Kim Kardashian's biggest I did a video on that so I'd add that was first indicated is what she big super kid on that right because she's a dumb-dumb yeah of course but she also influences a ton of people Yeah right that's unfortunate but exactly Steve Harvey had her on family feud they were on family feud the Kardashians in the West or talk about how fucking stupid Kim was but we know this go that's crazy there's no incentive for her to be intelligent there isn't I mean she's good at making money oh absolutely yeah absolutely and I don't fault her for that hey make you money booboo but  but at the end of the day you used to she still has access to scores of young influential minds I understand that that's unfortunate but there's nothing we could do about that there isn't but other than you point out the fact that she's a dum-dum pretty much yeah yeah it's not terrible person I don't think it's B I don't know I don't know the woman I just don't well I've heard a talk I just don't think she's really interested in expanding your mind I just don't think that that's something that's not beneficial but that's her here's the thing though the mindset though is there are people who we paid to carry guns right I don't need to carry them therefore you don't either so what you're saying about her is that she's anti-gun she talks about being anti-gun yet she's constantly surrounded by people of guns that's a fact absolute fact so you cancel this fact so then you can't turn around and tell me that no you don't need a firearm right of course you know I bet you've been seven foot tall dudes strapped to the fucking gills all around you yeah so it's it's man it's frustrating because it's like I get it I would love to have a dude standing out here with a ar-15 slung over their shoulders ready to protect me out of given notice where I could afford it I pay for it not do it the funny thing is I'd still carry a gun on me because I can't always be exactly where I am right you know what I mean that's a paranoid way to live though isn't it what difference does it make think about it how much does it affect me I wake up every day put a gun on my hip and go out and do the exact same thing I would do if I didn't happen but you don't think about it so you in the in a sense you feel like you're not paranoid I'm not paranoid no there's no nothing no more paranoid than any than any person that has a fire extinguisher in their house hmm think about it it's it's like I don't walk around like oh my god oh my god who's coming to get me that's paranoia right what I'm doing is being prepared right well there could be levels of preparedness you start being hit diminishing returns where starts to being like it starts to take away from your quality of life mm-hmm but me putting a gun on my hip and just going about my business that doesn't interfere with my life enough to say you know it is not quite worth it you know it's funny that what you said about like humility and that you like more calm and relaxed since you've been involved with guns the same thing happens with jujitsu and martial arts training in particular but jujitsu in particularly because he had strangled so much hurts right now because I was rolling with a guy just before I came out like last week and it does it man it's such a beautiful sport it's beautiful but it also lets you know your place in the food chain especially when you first start out know these domain like you start to realize you really honestly can't call out an elite human until it's too late what do you mean so when I started before I started really kind of getting into you know like MMA so forth and so on I thought I could spot out the guy you don't want to mess with no right you know what I mean yeah and then I went to class and then he knew my coach started pairing me with different people and I'm like holy crap like if I was seeing this dude was just walking down a sidewalk I'm like yeah I can handle him and now I'm rolled up in the pretzel as nuts in my face yeah nerd assassin a 10th Atlantic we got a whole fucking army of them he would they like computer dorks no kill you with their legs to wrap their legs are on your neck choke you to sleep if you can't even stop it from happening this is crazy nothing man and then Maya and I always get stuck and I'm gonna overpower them and I'm like now yeah you better off being weak believe it or not best jujitsu is weak man's jujitsu I would say if you're gonna learn jujitsu learn from a small guy yeah cuz you learn from a small guy they they've never been able to cheat meaning they never know what muscle type of things I've always had to have perfect technique yeah techniques everything when it comes to jujitsu literally you have to have some strength for sure and strength with technique is the ultimate coach but perfect technique is where it's at and you get that from like little guys like Barret Yoshida Eddie Bravo Euler grace are the smaller guys are the ones that you want to learn from because they've never been the big guy the big guys are like top game guys yeah smash pass guys those guys were just relying on horse power and leg strength and shit those that's not the way to learn though you know the way to learn is to go around things God show and you know the funny thing about that is do you know why I started doing it why someone said what if they take your gun away bro mmm no one said that I said it to myself oh right I said to myself because I didn't I almost thought I was over depending on it because we remember the gun is a tool mm-hmm carry a knife too I used to I used to but I float I float I'm in this weird space where like my jeans are kind of sorta a little too tight and not like so they're not quite skinny jeans but it's kind of like after a certain point I have too much stuff going on I got the answer for you my friend here you go it's called a fanny pack you know do we have some here you would you never wear this you would never wear this I'm down to try anything come on man well tactically Wow some of them but they have like ones their tactical ones they rip them open that's what yeah you have a tactic going I'm all for it no this is just a regular one see this you keep your shit on you so you don't have your pockets all filled with shit see here's mine do you have a knife here's my fanny bong this is what I consider a fanny pack oh that's a little big yeah I know but then again I'm the guy who carry it but I'm the guy who runs around with Macbook iPad you know cuz I carry one everywhere pretty much if I can bring you back because I'm currently working writing working yet right well you would you like what kind of stuff I screw it pretty much eighty to ninety percent of my show oh yeah I die right all the videos I do I write them do you write them and then put them on a teleprompter do you practice about sometimes it's straight off the top sometimes and teleprompter it just depends what we feels gonna give to communicate the best to what I'm trying to achieve oh that's cool yeah wow that's that shows work ethic for sure that's I mean I don't I don't have a life you know I really don't all I do is work work out and eat so is this these videos is this your entire life now I for the most part yeah in terms of like your occupation yeah you don't work as a lawyer um I do a little bit I still have things with the small firm in Houston and then so other than that just other investments and things that I have going on about it so you're able to make a living off of these videos ah there was a time when you could do it on YouTube right none anymore yeah it's real recent right yeah within the last six or seven months well actually gun guy started noticing that drop a long time ago like I'm talking about we went from like so like half yeah and then now it's like 70% so in revenue and it happened like a couple years ago and how does that work the terms are like do they pick certain videos that are just not eligible for monetization I wouldn't know before it was just a drop in organic reach it just started like it was it wasn't anything formal so she's no stirred you out yeah that's that's that's what I picked up on cuz I started noticing I'm like wait a minute like I mean I wasn't living off the YouTube stuff but I was like this is it went like I just got my income cut in half so we hear yeah well there's there's been some people that have investigated this and there's been some inside sources that have told people that they actively target conservatives gun owners redneck they do it on Twitter they do it a lot of a lot of different places I don't know it's a hundred percent was that guy American privada guy that did those undercover investigative reports he sent a bunch of people into like bars and talked to Twitter engineers [Music] you know I'm talking about yeah now I will say this though there are so like there are certain people in these places that are actually they may not even agree with my stance but I've talked to them and they'll help me out the best that they can you know some people in Facebook some people at YouTube so forth and so on because there are those individuals you know the comment column go support is in a sense because you know they can't beat or explicit about their you know yeah you're not gonna have just a complete uniform left-wing ideology at any of these organizations it's gonna be some people that but they get stuck in these groupthink environments like Google or wherever the fuck it is and they can't speak out which is unfortunate because I'm like isn't this country this country was founded on the idea of having having this project release undercover footage of Twitter employees and employees engineers and employees admitting that Twitter employees view everything you post on their servers including private sex messages and dick pics in damnit I've never seen engineers also admit that Twitter analyzes this information to create a virtual profile of you which they sell to advertisers James O'Keefe has completed the book about the series entitled American privada my fight for the truth new era of fake news yeah so this guy is sent a bunch of people to talk to like engineers and I've seen the video stream well they're explaining how they algorithm and yeah how they make it so that these people don't even know that people can't see their their tweets I get it all the time people take send to me all the time like hey you know for some reason YouTube is forcing me to unfollow you like I thought I followed you but then I'm not following you and I think some of that's paranoia and I do some of it is some of it isn't yeah but it still begs the question because the numbers don't lie yeah right so like I know with Facebook there was times I was reaching millions of people with just a post but then that got cut in half but largely that was due to monetization that wasn't before Facebook was monetizing itself so they wanted to kinda they want you to pay to get access to your audience yeah you know what I'm saying so that I don't like it but it isn't it isn't like some deep secret kind of like oh I want to stifle your reach because you believe in this now there may be some of that going on right so I had for instance like I buy ads for my like merchandise that I sell on Facebook right cuz if I just post a picture of it my entire artist doesn't see it right right and so somebody went through my facebook and just deleted all of our ads like spits it's our money on ads and they just did Lee disapproved them out of nowhere and so then I called a contact and it was like now that shouldn't happen and then I went back and put a Mac up so sometimes it's even individualized right you know what I mean it's just an individual who disagrees with everything you stand for who has the power to do it well you met one that guy did that with Trump disabled his Twitter really did it for a couple days yeah now there's definitely people that have that kind of power and they abuse it I mean you see that everywhere you see there with moderators on message boards you see that with you know every time people have more power than you and they go I don't like this fucking guy this guy talking about his guns fuck his ass and they just yank them the weird thing is though like I I don't complain about it on my platform at all because no one cares yeah because I remember the first time YouTube started taking off taking like D monetizing my videos for ads I mentioned it and people were like good I don't like those ads anyway oh you do realize I have to pay to get this stuff done right right you know well no one no one seems to care until it comes and affects them exactly like that essentially what they're doing is they're they're censoring you by diminishing the amount of money that you can make yeah you know you could you could say it's not real censorship but it is censorship I mean it's it's it's pretty much what I'm dealing with right now so for instance right videos don't come out as consistently like I do gun reviews I'm known for my gun reviews right and I like my Gummer used to be very cinematic i voiceover I put thought into them I write scripts out for my videos the problem is - now before where I could afford to hire someone to edit them I can't write write write and I need that now more than ever because now on the political front of the things I'm running around I'm traveling that's why I always have my macbook with me I have to try to find places where I can try to edit a little bit and get things done but then the same people who like we don't care about the ads on your videos and you make money from your from your videos are saying people like why aren't you making videos as much as used to well I'm like yeah well I don't have the money to pay someone to edit the videos in order to keep pumping them out the way I was doing it before and I'm not gonna give you sub quality crap right I could just toss the video together and just throw it out there it's just too much noise you can't listen to all those people that are complaining and asking for things which is true but I really really do think that Twitter or YouTube rather is fucking up because they're opening up the door to a competitor that is really invested in free speech I disagree really how so it's the advertisers they are at the they are at the mercy of the advertisers they are but I know people over at YouTube they are deciding what they want said and not stature and this is how I know I brought up Jordan Peterson this woman that worked at UGA no and she said he's a troublemaker and I said how is he a troublemaker he had no answer so radical left-wing but not thoughtful not not thoughtful like she doesn't have a good argument for this and when you did when you push back she's used to being the boss at work she's used to just dismissing you yeah and when I was pushing back with her like what why is that why why is he a troublemaker like you tell me what's problematic about what he says no answer to that but yet able to dismissively say someone's a troublemaker when there are very highly respected intellectual that has amazing points about a lot of different things that resonates with a lot of very very smart people I think he's the Nietzsche of our top he's a very bright guy in a really good human and when you meet him he's a really good person so for some someone just say he's a troublemaker like okay no cuz he doesn't agree with you and and he's causing trouble with your organization because you're censoring people's views and viewpoints and it's so convenient to label someone all right or you know I mean this is this is what we're dealing with today there's these hate identity politics it drives me insane crazy it's crazy how many people flock to it - because it's intellectually easier very no yeah it's very easy you can sit there and then you just just regurgitate all of the talking points that you have this is why I don't do well on cable news hits ya because what ends up happening is like on this issue I intellectualize it like the conversation we're having now mm-hmm like I get the benefit I love this because we could sit here right if we need to think about something you know what that's that's a good point yeah let me think about that for a bit like on the table new things you can't do that I just did this kind of platform is the best platform because the conversation is never interrupted you never stopped for add yeah and no one can tell what I'm about to ask go to the bathroom oh sorry we could wrap this up soon but I wanted to I really wanted to get to other than not having gun-free zones yeah I mean not having everyone armed to the teeth and well no here's the thing here's the thing I'm saying if you're gonna have gun-free zones make them real gun gun-free zones don't just put a sticker on the window and then say you can't bring your gun in here and then not have physical measures in place to prevent it because otherwise I don't you prevent it they've have like somehow movie theater or some if you have a movie theater have them if you're gonna make it a gun-free zone have a metal detector cyber comes in and the metal detector goes off you're still fucking guns in the room and what do you have armed guards to keep people from so then so then don't make it a gun-free zone right okay but even if you don't okay say if you have a gun-free zone and you have a movie theater and you put the metal detectors on the only way to enforce that is to have guns okay yeah but you know I'm saying okay so if you want to say if you want to hire if you want to hire armed guard to stand there right with metal detectors because I mean the metal detectors are only as good as the person being able to enforce it right we need it we need the executive right right so that would be an armed guard right so we think about it though we do it at the airport yes you know saying we do it at certain nightclubs when I go I'm not admitting to go in the strip clubs where I am I go to strip club I get patted down that's a guard there's usually three guys there with guns right I mean and I don't besides the people they let in who shouldn't have them anyway there's always gonna be cracks right right but at least if you're gonna make it a gun-free zone put up the physical preventative measures to reinforce that you can't just a lot of people just don't stick her on a window and say this is a gun-free zone the only people who are gonna obey that or the people you're not even worried about anyway well think about movie theaters this movie don't even say this is a gun-free zone they do when do they say there's some  it's state to state so for instance like in in Dallas right where I live there are some movie theaters where I can bring my gun in no problem there are other movie theaters that have these signs that say you're not allowed to carry a gun in here right and so it is state to state some states they just require you to put up a business - business - it is absolutely is so from that perspective it's like it's like even the courthouse right when I go to the courthouse courthouse is a gun-free zone - the fact if you're a cop but what do you have to do when you go to a courthouse you go through metal detectors there are cops there were people there with guns so what do you do about schools same thing but like these guys that are showing up they're not even they're not even students oh that's cool like Masaryk land yeah but see hook think about it like this though this is where the argument gets really disingenuous because it's like oh we want to save our kids lives in schools right all right so the inner cities have more violence than we can think of right there's tons of shootings that go on outside of the schools in their cities when's the last time you heard a mass shooting at inner city very very rarely very rarely yeah it's not if not ever what's the one thing that they all have metal detectors huh what's the one thing that parkland didn't have metal detectors what's the one thing that a lot of these suburban schools they get shot up don't have metal detectors well you know it's one of the things that they've found - is that it's it's a very strange sort of situation but when you deal with places that have a lot of violence when you deal with places that have gun violence and crime what you don't have in those places is the random mass shootings you have one on one crime one on but the the tangible reality of actual gun violence for whatever reason sort of eliminates these mass shootings the mass shootings tend to occur in places where people think they're safe yeah right like schools movie theaters I think there's just a closer there's a different dynamic involved you know what I mean it's um it's gonna become more of an a knob because if you can here the violence in the inner city to violence in the suburbs which present themselves in by way of mass shootings if you compare the numbers as a whole mass shootings account for statistic for about one to two percent of all gun violence right and so but there's a seating higher number of percentage of gun violence in the inner cities right and it all really goes back down to our set forth by the economics so you have a situation in the suburbs of urban areas where economically speaking they're good right right so there's not really an incentive to disengage in random violence right you know there isn't a narco economy there that that feeds on itself that requires you to engage in a certain level and violence in order to survive whereas on the other hand in inner cities you do have that dynamic so from that perspective what ends up happening though even though there is an money isn't everything right money doesn't clear all so you're still gonna have instances of people who slip through the cracks because money doesn't care everything and so when it does happen it manifests itself in these random acts of mass shootings right whereas here there isn't if I know I'm going to school and I'm gonna have to deal with I'm gonna have to inevitably deal with the violence outside of school anyway it almost it almost makes it unnecessary to engage in random acts of mass shootings it's almost it's almost kind of like this perverted distraction from from winning the mass shoot a place up when you have to deal with violence on an ongoing basis every single day of your life right you know what I mean I think that's what their point was the point was that when violence is real and it's around you all the time there it's it doesn't become this attractive blow up the game version tube launch go take a leak and then we'll wrap this up and I'll be back cool young Jamie's gonna show me his collection of guns while you're gone he carries one in his pants at all times strapped right next to his dick do you think you'd ever carry a gun okay oh like what if like what if someone came in here and got us license for concealed carry and said young Jamie you need to be strapped all you have to do is fill out this paperwork and I'm gonna make it happen man I just don't personally feel I mean I I just I feel like it's also naivety or whatever that I don't feel the need to do it well most of the time you would have the need to do it right right the thing the question is if you were at a place like you know fill in the blank whenever one of these things has gone down a nightclub let's say that gay nightclub in Orlando maybe you're curious and you walk around about that man at the night he came out yeah how about the Batman one or it wasn't there one in an Amy Schumer movie there was I think so yeah yeah yeah there was a master night sir no I think it was an Amy Schumer movie one of our movies because she became like this big anti-gun advocate afterwards what do you think that you would ever find yourself in a situation where you'd want a gun I mean I after that happen I just I was I've gone to movies and pictured it happening right and I don't I don't you just think about what you would do and I don't know that pulling out a gun and firing back is even in that my conscious thoughts it's it's definitely in the cards if the guy has a gun and he's in the room and you see one guy shooting people and you're there and he's not shot you yet it's definitely in the option I suppose so yeah I'm it depends on how long you're in there too if it's also whether or not you can keep your shit together what someone's shooting you know I mean keeping your shit together whilst while guns are going off and but that is that is not a normal thing for you and the amount of adrenaline that would be pumping through your body we're talking about if you were in a situation where mass shooting was going down yeah the people to think they could just pull out their gun and shoot that person you might fucking hit random people you might hit the wall you might hit the ceiling like here's the thing about I'll tell you I have a lot of experience in archery and one of the things that happens with people when they're shooting a live animals they panic a big fucking moose walks in and you you might hit that moose in the dick you might not even things as big as a building you might miss it totally I mean it happens all the time 20 yards away people miss the entire animal they just and that's something that's not even gonna fight back that's just a moose so the end the Vegas shooting thing I got any any witness reports or anything are so hard I feel like anything even video reports there's it's such a chaotic situation Sunday night everybody's wasted yeah it's so wasted yeah how what are you gonna do you have no idea well it's also one of those things too is a real problem with the conspiracy theories because one of the things that happened out of the Vegas situation was people would show up at all these different casinos and say someone's shooting so they would say the security we go there's an active shooter at Circus Circus there's an active shooter so all the conspiracy theories were like look they're shooters everywhere there were shootings everybody know there was people everywhere that we're freaking out because this fucking guy was just gunning people down from a hotel room one thing I've learned about being a lawyer eyewitness testimony is not reliable eyewitness testimonies dog shit man I've had people tell me about situations where I was there I was there I'm like dude that is not what fucking happen and enough to go over it with them and they're like oh yeah maybe you're right I will say this though people stopping mass shootings with firearms happens more than people realize it does happen mm-hmm it happens it's very disingenuous to deny it happens yeah there's a lot of stories out there where it's happened and people don't know about it because they're not they're not gonna push it so you think the elimination of gun-free zones would be the way to protect people I say no I'm gonna clear it I'm gonna clean up a little bit if you're gonna have a gun-free zone have physical preventive measures in order to to enforce it if you're not going to do that eliminate them I think they're I think first and foremost this would be the first thing that we should do there should be some sort of a public hearing on the use of SSRIs antidepressants psych medications and their corresponding instances like the the the amount of instances where these shooters are on these things Houston I don't think people are aware I'll say this much to piggyback off what you're saying if I was diagnosed with a mental disorder I have first thing I would do is I would go to a bookstore or go online and figure out every possible way that I can sell Pope my way through it because I won't touch this stuff well one of the things that's just as effective if not more effective I think Google this cardio I think exercise and running is more effective to treat depression than SSRIs I am almost certain that that's the case I don't doubt it at all I think you think so many people are addicted to marathons yeah Oh believe me they wanted to get high yeah there's there's something to it man I get high when I run for sure is there anything there every time I go to the official site and it says it's not a real thing who's what officials CBI dot was the NCC I like what I did a study on it it's exercise a viable treatment for depression oh they want to say no get pilled up but there there are studies that have been done that show because I know Rhonda Patrick was discussing it I have to be freakin I'm I hate taking medicine like I have to be on the floor before depicting prescribing exercise before medication aerobic activity has shown to be effective treatment for many forms of depression so why are so many people still on antidepressants well here's one reason and this is not to dismiss the people that are depressed cuz I know people that are depressed and it's a horrible thing and I know people that have been helped by antidepressants I know people that if my good friend Ari he was suicidal he got on antidepressants he's happy as fuck now he's off of them it helped him yeah my friend Brian it was the same thing not the Brian that we know another Brian he he was a jujitsu guy that I knew he had a real fucking problem got on SSRIs turned his life around found a good woman got it got in a great relationship to start his own business wean himself off of them now he's happy there's sometimes people find ruts in their life we had a podcast with a guy wrote a book on it a guy Johann Hari who wrote a book on depression the SSRIs for depression heart failure patients not so fast the studies should put to rest the practice of starting SSRIs and depressed patients with heart failure in an attempt to affect CVD outcomes what a CVD cardiovascular disease okay oh well that's what people with heart problems if eclis but it's also depression yeah people with depression and heart failure yeah fucking exercise I think is not is it's a requirement of the human body I really agree with something because I mean even my darkest times so I'm never at my I'm more I'm never more at my best than actually when I'm down when I'm going through things because if because my my response to it is act with is to tighten up to force you to foe exactly yeah and so one of those things that I do is like I've been to gym everyday for last two weeks right it forces me to one of those things that happened that one of the things that happens is I start working out more yeah because of the clarity of mind I get after the fact right and in the sense of accomplishment and then it kind of starts me off in a way where it's like okay now what's next it's like I'm chasing I'm chasing the next thing to conquer but but yeah I agree with you all hardly I think I think focusing on it's focusing all means outside of just prescribing pills yeah right I don't like taking pills I don't like things that alter my mind I don't I don't like maybe because I'm a control freak in that sense this weird guy with a hundred guns is a control freak you know I think she was just thinking about I had thought while I was using your super toilet yeah she could Joe Rogan's one of my guns and then I realized you can't even own it here I can't nope what can I own what do you have that I can't own what they don't it's the first gun I ever the first gun I've done so this one just so happens to be one that you can't no you see you have a company that makes him yeah what I did was I I came out with a Signature Series line of handguns well this is the first one because it's not allowed to California what's what's wrong with it y'all have a list of guns that you're allowed to own it it's not on and then like you would have to there's this micro stamping that's required for any gun it's not on list and it's so prohibitive yeah it's weird so what is the different what kind of guns are they what is it other went as far as they're prohibited the one that you have that I can't have oh I can't pull it aside if you want okay you mean that particular gun yeah oh yeah what's about it like what is this spec state just it just it just is like it's just a list of guns I don't really know exactly the caliber is it the semi-automatic capabilities because there are some automatic guns on the list that you're allowed to own there are other it's just arbitrary that's what it seemed like to me what kind of guy is it it's a me he'll look it up Wow if you want to pull it full of tiered of Tyr e de fe NS e tier defense calm there we go dum dum yeah there's some weird shit I mean we got Jerry Brown's our fucking governor that goofball the firearms transfers work order phone gallery contact Tier one yes a bt y re people can't shoot mass shooting going on pressure actually no you see one where says the advocate yes that's it name of gun is the advocate someone tyr does my service unavailable all the hackers it got to it already fuckin Russians bro nasty problems go back to get her pasty problems I don't know if everything we were to kill doing we just killed it you can't take a couple hundred people and it but the by the time that it hits YouTube though isn't it or two later seconds twenty seconds to type in type in the advocate and then Kohli Anwar and then see what that does and then like erased air defense though click on the top yeah we killed that website go to images killed that way there you go those that's the gun okay and why that seems like a normal handgun it is so what the fuck is wrong with it why can't I have it I know I wasn't asked the folks your leaders and calls but what are they saying is wrong with it like was specific I don't know why they make the decisions they make in California to be honest what what is the specs of this gun what it is a nine-millimeter handgun semi-automatic is it because it's semi-automatic or no no I don't think so no no just I don't I don't think that's the basis like I don't I don't no the the complete basis and reasons for why certain guns are allowed handgun whines in California and others I'm pretty sure they're gonna be tons of people who tell me this because I have a huge audience in California at these sections my one of my biggest audience there's a lot of gun owners in California people people aren't you know the idea that guns in California are somehow another rare the only fun thing is the birthplace that they are 15 was in California yeah well that's a weird gun it's a gun that people just have demonized it's not the most powerful gun it's not the scariest gun but looks military but they don't even use it in the military they don't use it in the military but to be honest with you if they did I'd want that gun why because it's the most effective means to protect myself right like I don't I don't understand this idea of neutering guns to the point where to new doing gun some point of irrelevance or ineffectiveness it's a people that don't use guns they have this idea and this is this is where we're at now I think one of the things that I'm getting out of this conversation with you is that there's not really a clean answer there's not a clean answer and if there was people would have figured it out it's almost like society has to continue to evolve and one of the way society evolves is having these conversations you and I have in this conversation where a few million people are going to listen to it and then millions of people on their own having these conversations and people looking at the reality and that's in that way I think what you're doing is important and what a lot of people are doing is important where they're talking about the actual numbers in the actual statistics and that's letting us get a look at it and that's the one thing that I try to convey with my videos I don't care where you stand on the issue I just will have a shit ton of more respect for your position if it's from a position of Education right if you actually have some knowledge I'm not saying you have to be a Jedi Master firearms mm-hmm just understand the very basics the fundamentals we have politicians pushing policy based on things that make no sense right like it actually exposes the fact that they don't know anything about firearms and so it's like you're gonna push policy on something that you don't know anything about right and so it's disingenuous and in really dishonest so that's the biggest frustration I have I'm I look at it look I'm gonna educate you and give you the information that you need so that you can make an informed opinion about it if at the end of the day I take your shooting I tell you the stats I tell you about how guns function and how they work if you still are anti-gun I can respect that mm-hmm now that doesn't mean you get to then push your anti-gun agenda on to me and limit my rights because of it but I can respect that at least we can walk away and say hey look well I think we're always got it from a different perspective a swig allottee of the sheer number of guns that we have in this country it's a staggering number so you're not gonna just take those away you're not where you gonna put them and that's just now there's some people were like well we can devolve the number over time right we can just put these laws in Oxbow and they can get bad for a little bit but then over time I can you doing that weird voice where you say I always do they're out of time they had that gun place would you be interested in sitting down like maybe on this show if I had an anti-gun advocate I beg for it okay not not to say not not here's something reasonable here's the thing I'm not trying to get up here in crush this person and and all that stuff I've done it to death right but I do want to have the conversation right you know and I've done it on my show the only problem is is it's too easy to ignore because of the platform that it's all right you know you had someone on your show that made reasonable points like if somebody wanted to watch you with in some sort of a debate with an anti-gun person is there a show that you could recommend that people go watch right now that I was on yes on your show on my show uh-uh well seize the thing though so one of the biggest flaws of the people that were on my show that would I had that conversation with is you could instantly see it was more of an education process because you could tell they didn't know much so what what happened is that they make a point about why they believe this then I would give them information and then would be like oh okay okay you see what I'm saying I do um I'm sure there's someone out there that is educated and is anti-gun well we'll have someone find them well I have this I have a publicist we'll have him we'll have Matt Staggs please let me know because I would be all for it yeah I really would there's this probably someone out there that's reasonable that has good points and has a well-thought-out sound argument it would be interesting to listen to you talk to that person absolutely but I think one of the things we could take away from this is that this is a it's a messy situation it's not clean it's not like hey we're putting poison in the water stop putting poison in the water clean up the water it is not that simple it's not super complicated it deals with mental health it deals with freedom and it deals with law-abiding people who aren't doing anything wrong where people are trying to take away their rights they're enthusiasts they love guns and I don't think there's any look look here's a perfect example you're sitting here with a gun on your shirt what kind of gun is that ar-15 you have an ar-15 ya actually sell these I have I have an archery shirt on I could walk anywhere with this yeah no one would feel threatened no I'll kill the fuck out of you with this bow right but no one would feel threatened but if you walk around with that people will you know you are one of those doing you're a good guy are you telling people you have that on you yeah is that what you're saying you warning people you're a dangerous person you know oh you're an archery enthusiast oh so I did archery at camp when I was in the Boy Scouts we shot bows I'm sorry Cara I'm gonna start opening girls at the bar with that yeah I shoot archery  so listen I appreciate the conversation I don't think we got anywhere but I don't think you can I think we talked about what I mean to be honest with you it's a conversation that needs so here's what happens things happen in our in our reality that forced a specific focus on the part of the conversation right and so of course we weren't gonna sound on a how long we've been here how long we've been two hours two hours right we've been having this gun debate for how long now in this country years right yeah yeah but I think for a lot of people especially people who follow me they wanted me to come on your show not because you and I were gonna come to an answer but to educate right well also to have what we have on the show of where I try to have on the show just discussions just talk exactly and let people talk let people express themselves and I think you definitely did that today you expressed yourself you're a very reasonable guy anybody looks at you says you're a maniacal gun nut that's you pulling that out of your own head you know um but I would love to do that and we'll try to find somebody we'll try to find somebody if you're open to that absolutely trying to find somebody that could could argue the point but thank you brother actually no thanks for having great time pleasure hey guys real quick before you leave I'm getting a lot of questions from you all about the merchandise that I wear in my videos like this hat and the shirt that I have on all of this stuff can be found online at shop mr. : on the war.com on it I have a whole host of items like the pew pew like branded hats shirts tumblers and sweatshirts you name it along with the hoodies as well as the ar-15 detailed design I have them in all those products as well along with the ammo sexual brand and my seeing logo stuff so be sure to click the link in this video and order your stuff today I'm mr. Colin war and I'm out on the surface the pew pew life is homage to our days as children playing cops and robbers when our guns were nothing more than a raised thumb and outstretched middle and index finger and the pew pew sounds coming from our cookie crumb covered mouths  however below the surface the pew pew life represents the people who take the symbolic and literal representation of gun ownership very seriously the gun represents a source of protection for ourselves our families and the people we love guns also provided a sense of enjoyment and fun to our lives and for this we make no apologies symbolically the gun is a beacon of freedom and natural rights because there is no more natural right than the right of self-preservation one who cannot exercise this right can I call himself free this is why we embrace the pew pew life because ultimately it's about the people", "RGleMzGHEW0": "if your brain was as big as your tits for real howdy just walks around with Izzy just [Applause] [Music]  [Music] answer chaser don't take another step  like I said today we are apprehending Jeffrey Jeffrey is a violent criminal so therefore I brought a violent partner with me got a new partner Chandra ready to kick some ass Chandra is a bodybuilder a veteran and all-around badass so today we have a couple different tools that we're going to be using we added a couple lot we change our arson up a little bit so the shotgun is going to be repurposed we're going to be using a double Koosh round this is a rub around that we can actually shoot directly at a person or add a target as opposed to the old rubber rounds we have with a shotgun that could not be shot in a person because they're basically go through them and kill them so these are a much more applicable tool for the show these manage these Koosh rounds are going to replace these rubber rounds these are the black rubber rounds that we use before through the air compressed paintball gun essentially the paintball gun is now going to be used exclusively so for 68 caliber teargas rounds those are these guys right here so this con will be exclusive teargas which is kind of cool and now the shotgun is exclusive Koosh round the biggest problem you're having with rubber rounds is on the paintball gun the air the air tank deplete depreciates every time you use it so each rubber round that goes out the velocity changes now with these rubber rounds the velocity is consistent so we know we're going to get a good impact each and every time I'm secondarily as a backup to the tear gas gun because the tear gas is operating on air we have a new 12-gauge pepper round this gives us an 8-foot blast radius this is very effective for outdoor use and then my new favorite addition is this custom ar-15 from colfax tactical that I got and something a little bit different than this one this one is going to shoot a long range rubber round let me show you what that looks like right here so this is still going to shoot this is a regular five five six P mag shoots everything all the same is a different bolt in here so that it accidentally I could not put a live five five six round in there and accidentally kill somebody so at this we're going to be using a very similar round this is an MMR a man marker round so essentially this is going to hurt somewhere in the vicinity of a little bit less than the Koosh ball depending on distance and a little bit more than then the tear gas round but in any event this is going to leave the barrel at around 375 feet per second it's not gonna kill somebody but it's gonna give them a really nice what's up sting the problem with the Koosh ball rounds is this needs to be used between three and 15 feet these we're going to use between 15 and 50 feet so depending on the distance away from our target and depending on what we're trying to do we're gonna use a different weapon system for that as you can see that the ar-15 has a 3x scope on there so obviously this is our longer range as opposed to an EOTech style red dot scope on our tear gas gun because we're going to use this at close quarters or close proximity to people therefore we're gonna use a different type of a different type of sight that I already had a scratch and then this does not have any optic on it because we're gonna be using this so closely that if you can't iron sight your target you shouldn't be shooting it and that's about it you ready to go let's do it and that's all them 200 I didn't even show you that guys need me to show you look at the new pistol today we're converting all our Glocks over to these p320 Sig Sauer x5 legion pistols this is my new favorite pistol just look at look at how sexy this thing is it's just it's just oh look at that sight on there that's let that the slide is my favorite I don't know why I just all these little holes and makes it look tactical it's cooler much cooler and I can fit my Oh light on here which is pretty sweet so that's the end of the new the new weapon systems now keep in mind folks on this show you can send over here at me if you want feel free to be in front of the camera it's okay oh okay so you may notice that in future episodes or maybe not these weapons may or may not be available because shaundra I kind of want to get an episode of her out very soon and right now we probably have 30 episodes before she even came on so keep in mind for the future that some of these weapons will come in and out of the show until they're fully implemented in 30 or 45 days all right let's go that's not

fuck away from me sit down", "1nCPpMpeDc4": "absolutely awesome I couldn't believe what I could see it was over the horizon that many ships ships everyplace thousands as far as you could see as the Emperor toward Tokyo the largest fleet ever assembled approached the Japanese island province of Okinawa  there were more than 40 carriers 18 battleships 200 destroyers it was faster than the invasion fleet at Normandy nearly 200,000 troops had boarded at 11 ports from Seattle and San Francisco to Leyte in the Philippines we had the failing of confidence because all these big guns were firing in there and we thought well with all this artillery that probably killed most of the Japs all will be easy their mission as the Japanese High Command had predicted was to take Okinawa and use it as a staging area for an invasion of Japan's main islands only 350 miles away  the troops who landed knew this could be the Imperial Army's last battle before it defended the main islands they knew the Japanese would fight to the death  oh man you're scared to death it's no question about it your it was frightened as a man could be as you go in but there was no shooting going on nothing happened which was real strange once while you'd hear a gunshot someplace but nothing happened nothing zero everybody was shot there was no resistance at all they went out on April 1 they thought what is this an April Fool's joke where the chaps with all this big build-up on the boat they told us about the ferocious snakes and chaps are worse than the snakes and we're going in there and it's gonna be maybe the final battle and then there's nobody on the beach for five days American forces were unopposed as they headed south an admiral radio Chester Nimitz commander of the Pacific Fleet I may be crazy but it looks as if the Japanese have quit the war at least in this sector and Nimitz wired back delete everything after I may be crazy  general Mitsuru Ujima could smile from his mountain headquarters beneath ancient shuri castle he was luring his enemy into a trap gooshie Jima was very smart he followed a theory the Americans called a cornered rat theory terrains everything here and the southern part of the otter the terrain explains it's a series of ridges in the south so he does steel concrete and coral Garrison's inside the mountains so he has two things you need to win a battle he has concealment and he's got the advantage of height  the first major line of defense was a kakuzu ridge bush adem\u00c3\u00a1s command post was under shuri castle four miles south in the main line of defense these ridges ran the width of the island there were no open flanks the army's commander decided to storm the ridges you got up every morning and it would be another craggy rock piled hill and in the army infantry would take off over whatever open the ground there was chaptered then lay into them and we try to keep them down with our machine gun and that was like a continuum every day it was the same story only different guys got hit and different guys got killed I used to look at those infantry guys go across so of course those fields god it's tough to believe  the Army's sending tanks - does she know Sean any nice to see conscripts were ordered to deliver bombs to kakuzu for destroying us tanks carried ten kilogram bombs on our shoulders and headed for kakuzu at night the Americans launched a starship and then came the gunfire what the show we had to hide in the shade whenever a star shell was up but finally we managed to deliver the bombs to kakuzu Chicago Auto at the Dix terrible sauce back then I heard that the next morning when the tanks came hastily armed the bombs saw you and made suicide attacks you know the tanks I know he's shown a no Cody mess after nearly a month of attack and counter-attack Marines relieved a shattered Army division we get down there and we were in a particular place with wounded left on stretchers they had to evacuate very quickly and we found the wounded Americans dismembered and mutilated horrible we found the laying there with the heads cut off and the hands cut off and that private parts and their mouth just hated them God did we hate them and we wanted to kill him you talk to the average marine he enjoyed us and that sounds bloodthirsty but it's true you enjoyed it that was one less chap we had to worry about they had not been killing men a veteran recalled they were wiping out dirty animals we just looked at him at they were just just something to eliminate we well we didn't think of them as a humans or anything like that if you see him shooting and that's the way we all felt  when you're fighting an enemy that will not surrender that considers surrender disgraceful and punishes prisoners who do surrender for being unmanly it treats them that way this is a war that's got to fly out of control and the atrocities really begin to mount in early May after a month of fighting US forces approached Japan's main defensive line there was a hill on it Marines called Sugar Loaf one remembers it as a pimple of a hill you  could have run the six hundred yards across that plane and up Sugar Loaf Hill he recalled in a few minutes  the defenses of general Matsuda Luigi Japan's commander on Okinawa were so thorough it would take the sixth Marine Division seven days and 14 attempts by some counts the battle for Sugar Loaf Hill was the hardest for Americans anywhere in World War two when we first went up Sugar Loaf Hill we had a number of people shot in the back couldn't believe it how did he get shot in the back when you assaulting a hill but it was coming from all sides and the Japs were just zeroing in on US Marines encountered fire from positions dug into the front of the hill mortars lobbed from the back of the hill fire from neighboring hills and artillery from shuri castle almost a mile away sugarloaf could be resupplied by tunnels they ran from shuri castle to all the supporting hills if sugarloaf fell general issue Gemma's main line of defense would collapse marines soon realized it was not about to fall we found out that okinawa had been used for a Japanese artillery range for over 50 years so they knew every inch of it and they could drop a shell in your back pocket so we were completely exposed going up that hill the Marines tried again we just went down there and when we got on the hill and all this open ground behind us they shot us up and killed a lot of people wounded a lot of people at least a third of our company  sacrificial charges they get repelled again and again they actually get to the summit get in a firefight with the Japanese and get pushed off the rock pushed off the hill  the Marines kept assaulting sugarloaf hill  we took that hill 13 times 13 times then the night then come back from the back of the hill from under the hill from beside the hill and that counter-attack we suffered terrible casualties and would have to pull back a little bit  torrential rains and mud also hindered their advance there was no way to bury the dead the Marines lived among them  night time brought its own terrors these sneak attacks at night it's psychological warfare and works in a lot of cases it drove a lot of Marines nuts this one person he was right next to me and it was a transient we were in waiting for the word to muadh all of a sudden he started crying and pulling grass out and putting in his mouth and stuff like that  more than 1200 Marines would leave the battle of sugarloaf hill with what was called combat fatigue  on the seventh day the artillery fire that softened up Sugar Loaf Hill and its neighboring Hills was unusually heavy  then the Marines cleared out the side hills tanks encircled Sugarloaf and attack the backside caves  after seven days the Battle of Sugar Loaf Hill was over Okinawa main line of defense began to crumble general Yuchi Jima began to retreat  American casualties at Sugarloaf Hill were more than 2,500  Emperor Hirohito wanted a final decisive battle general Lucia Jima was trying to wage it the idea is to bleed the Americans it's a dual strategy you can't win the war but you can bleed them such an extent that we can get better peace terms  the longer we prolong it the longer that fleet sits out there and is susceptible to kamikaze air attack they thought the combination of the two along war of savage attrition taking casualties and then the slaughter at sea might convince the Americans that an invasion would be insanity", "mCjbgpSq38Y": "[Applause] [Music]  what's up guys this is the honest out lot here and today we're gonna be doing a pretty funny video we're gonna be talking about seven guns that I wish I didn't buy now I'm gonna get some hate from the fanboys from this video and I understand why I'm not saying all these guns will be terrible for you I'm just saying for one reason or another they were terrible for me and I wish it didn't buy them in this list I'm gonna try to explain why I bought them originally why I hated them and some options that I would recommend buying instead so let's get started at number 7 my Wilson combat in 1911 now I got to admit I've wanted a wolfson combat for as long as I can remember all I've heard were awesome things about it the most reliable the most accurate 1911 on the planet with top-notch craftsmanship and a slide is smooth is a baby seals ass looks like a super model and it handles like a dream almost all of that is actually true believe it or not except for the reliability which I wish I could say it didn't have issues with but I feel like I had many more reliability issues than I should have for the whopping four thousand dollar price tag but the real problem that I had afterward was the resale value if you decide to sell your gun after you get it you'll be lucky to get right around three quarters what you paid for it and if you're bad at math that's about a thousand dollar loss minimum I really can't stress enough how disappointed I was especially considering my Springfield and Dan Wesson 1911 s performed better and costs a lot less money number six is going to be the kel-tec pf9 now I'm not a Celtic hater by far but let's be honest there's a few good designs that they have but there's also a lot that you should stay away from and this for me is one of those for sure I bought it because it was very light weight one of the lightest nine-millimeter pistols on the market at right around 12 ounces which is pretty impressive and it's also really cheap I think I got it at a gun show for right around $200 and lastly it comes highly recommended by one of the youtubers I like nothing fancy so how bad could it be right think about it for a second put a nine-millimeter round in an unreliable 12 ounce frame with no traction to speak up and what do you get for me you get a fairly unsuitable gun yes it's lightweight and a reasonable caliber but if you can't hit anything what's the point the recoil was extreme enough that my why didn't even want to practice with it and if you don't practice so that you might as well not carry it because you won't be able to shoot it effectively it did have some pretty serious reliability issues in a lot of the ammo that I tried and for me if I buy a 9-millimeter pistol there's so many options on the market today if it doesn't shoot everything 9-millimeter I get tired of it pretty quick and move on to something that does if you're gonna buy a subcompact single stack for me I would stick with a reputable company like Glock Smith & Wesson or Walther number five the Taurus 608 now tourist doesn't get a lot of love for me and I think that's for good reason I bought this gun because of the price $600 compared to a thousand for the Smith & Wesson since it's on the list of guns I regret buying you can guess I should have just went with the Smith & Wesson I also got this revolver because it was eight shots of 357 very impressive it came with a ported barrel and high-vis adjustable sights that's a lot of great features for the money however in classic Taurus fashion they sacrificed build quality and reliability for cool factor in features this gun could barely get through a full cylinder without a failure if I were you I would pick up a Ruger or Smith & Wesson buy once cry once at number four the car CW 380 another unreliable pocket pistol makes the list the car is great on paper coming in at a featherweight ten ounces making it one of the lightest pistols you can carry with a reasonable caliber for self-defense it also comes with the car name which has a great track record but this gun could barely get through a magazine of any animal that I fed it not to mention the terrible trigger by today's standards I know a lot of you like it but you should try a ppq and get back to me also I happen to be pretty tall so this tiny gun barely fit in my hands to begin with it might be great for your grandma but it's not great for me and I'm glad I sold it if you're in the market for a 380 pocket pistol check out the Ruger LCP Glock 42 or the very very awesome sig p228 number three the remington rp9 now normally I give guns the benefit of the doubt but this gun is just a huge piece of crap add it to the list of failed remington products in the last 10 years thanks freedom group way to ruin one of the oldest firearm companies in the world this may be the least reliable gunner this year not to mention the grip was absolutely terrible maybe the worst that I've tried there was no texture at all and it literally felt like a broomstick a very spongy trigger that worked about 75% of the time with no tactile or audible reset not to mention the fact that it slaps you in the finger every time you shoot it so how did Remington decide to turn this sinking ship around well they decided to hire the old CEO of Taurus I wouldn't hold your breath thinking that Remington's quality will increase anytime soon with so many alternatives to this gun why even buy it get yourself a Glock ppq Sig XD cz Smith & Wesson or almost anything else at number two the DPMS g2 recon this is the gun that started my channel I was very excited for this gun to be released and I bought it soon after on the recommendation of reputable people on YouTube like James Yeager it was supposed to be as light as an ar-15 very reliable very accurate and you could even take some standard ar-15 parts and put them on this 308 gun what I got however was a little bit different than advertised the gun that I purchased wouldn't function a single round right out of the box and it had to be sent back to have the bolt resized so it would at least move back and forth inside the rifle I got it back a couple of months later it's still malfunctioned one or two times every hundred rounds or so however I did fix that issue as well myself by adding an adjustable gas block it also was not as accurate as advertised to say the least about one to one and a half M away at best I have record air fifteens that shoot better than that did I mention that it recoiled like a truck full of dildos falling off a bridge and landing on your shoulder I might be exaggerating a little bit here but it still had about double the recoil of my M and P 10 and they're the exact same type of gun shooting the exact same caliber I decided after this gun that I would start a youtube channel and I would be honest about my experiences so people don't have to go through what I went through to find out what gun works the best for them for me personally if you're looking for g2 recon I would steer more towards arrow precision or definitely the Smith & Wesson M&P and number one it takes a lot to get to number one on this list but you made it the ultra 87 by Century Arms this is an 870 clone in 12-gauge I did a video on this gun titled the worst gun ever and pretty much everyone who saw agreed it's a cheap Chinese copy of an 870 imported by Century Arms why did I buy it you asked bought it because I've always bought brand-name shotguns like mosburger Remington and I wanted to try something different not to mention this gun was a little bit under $200 to add insult to injury my buddy needed a shotgun and I hadn't tried this out yet he was on a very strict budget so I gave it to him he shot about a box of ammo through it before the rails inside the receiver that the bolt rides on completely sheared off they're made of metal about as tough as a melted beer can so I guess I wasn't that surprised the bullet got jammed inside the receiver so hard that it wouldn't work and you couldn't break the action down to see what was wrong after taking it to a gunsmith to find out that my new gun no longer works and it would cost me more to fix it than buy a new shotgun of higher quality I decided to make the video and I stand by it please do yourself a favor and spend the extra fifty to a hundred dollars and at least get a Mossberg maverick use 500 or even a use 870 all three will last you your entire life and you'll be able to hand them down to your children and your entire life is a little bit longer than a box of

fathomed every time I visit the shop we're about to go to I learned a lot more this is a true educational video on the differences in gun safes in the manufacturing of gun safes my buddy Kurt who I purchased all of my Fort Knox ace from I have all my sage throughout the state of Florida different locations and hurts a professional and as you're about to see he's extremely articulate and he knows his stuff so whether you're in the market to buy a safe now or someday years from now come back to this video and watch listen to Kurt because he'll teach you of the questions you need to ask and the knowledge you need to have knowledge is power I think you'll enjoy this I know it's a little bit lengthy but I tell you what when we spend our hard-earned money on a pricey product like a safe whether it be six eight hundred dollars thousand dollars or three four thousand dollars you want to have the knowledge knowledge is power by the way welcome to weapons education comm let's go inside  here we are at sea II safes my friend Kurt the owner is inside he's going to give us a tour of his facility they just moved to this new location I'm in Deerfield Beach Florida the C stands for Kurt is his wife Elizabeth C II safes Deerfield Beach Florida and this is their premier showroom Kurt has got to be oh he is he is the most knowledgeable person in the United States on safes and there's a lot more it's a gun safes than you might think so let's go inside and take a tour Kurt it's always a pleasure to come to your facility thank you so much for giving us a tour of this new facility you're at how long have you been here now Oh Joe I first we're still doing a lot of major workings on it okay let's take a look congratulations you've been here about seven months I was at your other facility and you were just moving then you've come a long way and well how long you been a business since 1989 1989 well there's a lot more to save than people realize correct areas there is the safe industry has changed dramatically in the last 12 years and basically what what it's done is it's lightened up the metal while concealing what they've been doing and the consumers really get confused when they come into the store after calling on the internet because they don't know what a composite door is they don't know what what plate edge means and so what they're doing is they're buying something completely different than what they think they're buying and so one of the purposes of our business is to educate because we specialize we like to educate make sure that every one of our customers understands what they're buying there's a big difference between a Fort Knox safe like this and the imports as you walk on down here okay well twelve years ago roughly that time period the manufacturers decided to to bring their safes into mass merchant stores which really greatly increased the visibility of the saves the problem is is that most mass merchants are not in the safe business they're not in the security business so price is real big with them price points is a term that you'll hear all the time and what happened is is that as they did this the qualities that the safe had to go down to meet these price points and eventually most of the American production is is out of right now primarily in China with a little bit in Mexico and so what happens is is that customers need to understand what the different types of safes are for example when you look it up when you look at it safe like this and you look at this and you say wow that's a pretty thin door this is 3/8 inch steel this is not a thin door this is an excellent door but what happens is is that they see on the internet and they hear terms called composite and you'll look at this and this composite door right here has less than one-third of the steel of the first plate steel that you saw and this is one of the things that all the times when the customers are coming in what we like to do is we like to take them to this safe and what I'd like you to do is move this safe back and forth for me all right so when you move this safe back and forth what you're going to find is to say feels a certain way to it then we take them around a corner to a Fort Knox safe and what they do the same thing but it's advertised as the same door an inch and three quarter inch composite and the customers go in there and say well this door feels like three or four times as heavy well it's because it is three or four times as heavy so you've asked the wrong question the right question is how much steel is in this massive door and the next thing is is if you hear manufacturers talking about this area as being security this isn't security at all this is just a frame to hide moving parts that's all it is and so when you hear about this massive 7 inch door this massive 7 inch door or 3 inch door or 5 inch door might have less than an eighth of an inch of steel commonly referred to as 12-gauge there is a reason and customers need to understand that there is a reason why safes cost different amounts of money it's because what has gone into them and where they're made and how the welding is done you don't want a spot weld it's safe you want to say that as a continuous weld and there's a reason for that I'm not going to go on video as to a reason for that because I don't like giving people ideas of how you can short-circuit a safe I want to point out for you something if I can today it's a safe that Rhino safe company out in Idaho has made for our company and so what happens is I don't like selling imports I want to sell American pride let's take a look on the inside and so what we did is we co-developed an american-made safe in here that is that is near the import pricing except far better this quote-unquote skinny door of a quarter inch is has two times the metal of the Rhino safe called Bighorn it's an imported safe and you look at this door it has less than 1/2 the steel of their quarter-inch plate door right here what's the difference in price the difference in price of that safe is going to be anywhere from $5.99 to $6.99 and you'd be able to pick up this safe for 1249 what you have is double the steel on the door you have a heavier body you have a continuous weld frame you have you have your inside piece right here in your frame reinforced so when your four-way bolt work goes around the door what you have is you have a secure locking mechanism and you have the holes in the corner one of my pet peeves of having quote unquote import safes is what they like to do is they like to put two holes in the center and negate the fact that you can bolt a safe down properly having two holes in the middle of the floor doesn't do anything for both down and remember something they're going to attack I say four different ways that I have found in my 19 years of doing this which the first thing they want to do is they want to steal the safe so if you buy a safe and don't bolt it down that's like buying an alarm without putting it on big mistake the second thing they try to do is they try to pry it and I'm going to take you through these doors and show you the Messier part of my building here that we have not developed yet in the back here I have two businesses this is the smaller of the two and I want to show you a simple when they try to attack way number two way number two is this is a quarter-inch plate door that what happened is is that I figured that they work on this for one to two hours probably with three people they bent quarter-inch steel they never got into this safe this is one of the reasons why I like to see my customers start at a quarter-inch plate door with four-way boat work this worked and saved the customer over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars that was in this safe it was bolted it never moved so we made them start prying from an upward position as opposed to on the floor the third way that they attack to save and with what is my obsession is the cutting of an on towards cutting tool this is an 11 gage body on a set and so we're very concerned in our business about the cutting and at least making customers aware that saves can be penetrated and remember that when they do a security they're what they call their RSC rating and in English to you that's a residential security container when they do that test is for the door only and not for the body so the body on most safes is one-half to one-third of what the door is an actual metal content until recently with imports sometimes the door or is the same as what the body is that is unfortunate from your standpoint the fourth way that they'll attempt to get into a safe is if with excuse me is with torches and that's relatively rare and can these be negated yes you can but if you want to try to stop the cutting if you want to try to stop the torching one of the things that you're going to have to do is want to invest in a safe not buy a safe invest in a safe and get extra metals and stainless steel and anti heat materials that will dissipate the heat and won't allow a hole to be burned into it so you can custom make a safe with Fort Knox for instance that's why I purchased all my safes from either all Fort Knox can we talk about Fort Knox for a moment yeah for noxus is is our is is the backbone of our business and what it allows us to do is it allows us to take a basic safe and an add metal to it and so when you get a safe that is a door like this you don't know what the steel is Fort Knox will tell you in the brochure and I want all manufacturers to begin telling people what the actual metal content is in the door you have two pieces of metal in this safe that is a 10 gauge and a quarter and in English 10 gauge means a little over an eighth of an inch and in a quarter-inch plate on the back this is the part that's going to stop people not this behind here outside of the bolts this is a frame there's no metal in here to stop this is just a hide moving parts so I can take this door with Fort Knox that is 10 gauge and a quarter and make it 10 gauge but make the back piece 3/8 and make another piece 3/8 almost an inch of steel if that's what you want what about the side walls in the body the body has one piece of metal this is three parts steel to one part steel one piece of 10 gauge we can make this body a quarter inch on the outside and five pieces of 10 gauge on the inside almost an inch of steel and so what happens is is and one of those pieces of Steel if you want can be stainless steel that you're anti heat for tortes protection so what are we trying to do when we're trying to stop cutters we're stopping cutters by adding steel steel is going to stop and make people come in with a certain quality of tool that they don't normally do and so the idea behind this is it's as safe basically you need to remember sometimes when you're buying an item a security item you're condensing all your portable wealth into a single location into a steel box and it is amazing how many people don't understand what what the makeup is of that steel box what we're learning now they haven't got a clue the first star I showed you there the big horn had less than one-third of the steel that is in this that is in this safe but they're advertised identically and so you have you need to learn to ask the right questions and one of the suggestions I would make for you is I'm a free-market person so I don't care if you buy a safe at a mass merchant but you need to understand that mass merchants purchase purposes is price points not to sell you security when you get specialists like myself we start from the exact opposite mentality that says we want security prefer and we want to try to get the best price we can for you occur what if one of the viewers lives say in Oregon or California or Illinois or New Hampshire how could you sell them a safe we can sell a safe and with with many of the vendors that I carry in certain locations we have Florida for the most part with most of our vendors in the South America's and I have a network of other vendors that we would refer you to and I have to ask permission from you know from from the manufacturers if I can sell in certain areas but we'll be glad I will be glad to provide you with whatever information that you would want you know as far as it's trying to help you find a a professional vendor we specialize in this the people that I work with in our Summit co-op group specialize in this and so you're more apt to find a much better save at one of these specialty stores than you want a mass merchant so you can give them some information over the telephone and you can give them advice as to where to go in their local zip code yes we can now let me show you one other safe before we close here on this will show you the graph under safe people have heard about these on the website this is an inch and a half of solid steel hmm this isn't a composite door so unlike the doors that you were seeing before composite this is an inch and a half of solid steel with one inch in the body grrrrrr funder has a has a remarkable name you know to it they make only one or two safes a day there's only one reason why people will not buy a group under safe and that's price of the same what does that cost this is 11,000 oh my gosh for the Union well there's only one reason we find that customers won't buy the Fort Knox safe what do they cost more because because of the price like a safe like this would run you roughly thirty seven hundred dollars plus options you know to the safe so remember when you're looking at a safe like this and a Fort Knox safe and a safe in this size that might cost two thousand dollars there's a reason for it it's how they're made you know the one thing if I can impress you based on my 21 years of police work and 19 years doing this look at as safe as an investment if someone puts three rifles in front of you low medium and high and you pick the medium and high all the time don't look at three saves low medium and high and say do you have anything cheaper if you want to get good results well let's talk about the economy right now some people out of work some type money's tight if you're on a low budget what is the best safe for the money let's take a look at that Browning right there for instance you come in here this is our alley up here that you can be looking at the ground Browning medallion series this is one of their mid line areas where you would be you would be spending roughly twenty three twenty four hundred dollars for you can look at the superior which we consider to be an excellent safe in his price range that you would be looking at spending between 1699 and $19.99 for I mean anything's better than nothing in a four to three four thousand dollars safe course under the message plate it's a it's an excellent buy before Knox safe in this area which we consider the best in this range is $23.99 plus you know plus options to it what's for about a thousand dollars let's come on back over here the thousand dollars safe that we're going to be looking for in the end Assizes you're either gonna have to go with an import or with this new rhino series that we come in with different with different sizes to it I'm trying not to turn my back on its okay walking over here so please don't consider me to be rude when you get something like this at 12:49 or you get a smaller sister size of this this is a sixty by thirty by twenty one plus they handled if you got the smaller sister which is 56 by twenty seven by eighteen plus they handle you can get that for 9.99 all right with a quarter-inch door four-way bulwark 11 gauge body can't be that we consider it to be the best value you know that you're going to find anywhere we challenge you to look to see if you can get this type of metal now that you know that this type of metal right here under American one right here is more than twice as much metal as their imported version same company what about that one says to say if I say about six hundred dollars all the Winchester safe you can pick up here for you know for 449 $4.99 you know want to say very light 14-gauge door oh this I would I would suggest that you would say buy this safe for you know kids in the house and this is not meant for serious storage if you're going to be putting twenty thirty thousand dollars in the safe you're going to have to sit down there bike limping and spend a little bit more money the door is very light on this safe all safes hamper have purposes there is a purpose for a $500 safe there's a purpose for a $10,000 safe make sure you measure what you're going to put inside with what you're going to spend what about fire I see these stickers on here certified levels of one two three how does that well you get it you're going to find in the gun safe industry there's no one single company that is going to test the safe as there is with underwriter laboratory you know which dominates the non gun safe industry so basically what you're going to find is different companies with different temperatures you'll get anything from 20 minute or 30 minute or hour or 90 minute and so you want to look at the labels that you're going to see on the safe this one has a 20 minute label on it this one would have an hour label on it both import safes okay and okay and you would go on safes like the American made safes that would go anywhere from a 50 minute on a rhino to an hour on the Browning to 90 minute in the superior brand that you see over here to 90 minute into Fort Knox now remember something about fire liners there are two numbers that go with a fire liner number one is is how long number two is is what temperature that they tested it at so if you want to make a fire test seem longer you can do a two and a half hour test at 1,200 degrees well that's going to be the same as the temperature of 90 minute at 1680 all right so there's two numbers you look at both front and back you know one on is interesting all right so now you learn like a safe like this which doesn't look like very very much has now 200 percent more steel than the than the average safes that have a composite inch two inch and 3/4 door this has a 90 minute fire rating at 1500 degrees in a light medium level of safe really excellent value what about these dehumidifiers I use them in all my safes and you turn me on to those years ago and they do work I have zero rust issues they're inexpensive the purpose of a d-man fire very simply is is to heat up the air and what it does is it rotates the air in the safe itself and it keeps little moisture bits of staying on your gun and starting the rust process when you plug it into a all is a no maintenance item and so we recommend the dehumidifier over a never dry if you have a wall outlet because there's no maintenance to it all you have to do is touch it every time you go in to save if it feels warm to you it doesn't warm up hot enough to burn your hand you feel that you know what's working whereas with a never dry by the way don't put damper it in your safe it's an acid and so what happens if it ever spills is going to eat anything it comes in contact with it get something that is a non acid like a never dry here and what happens is is that you put this in the safe it's in taking a stick to water it absorbs the water and but at some point you're going to have to check it every five days to say six weeks to see what the water content is on the inside you take it out plug it in the wall overnight you're right back in business again without lighting we have found in in doing this for nineteen years one of the things that you find is that customers who buy electronic locks like their sales more than dials and yes I know all the internet stuff about how electronics break down for example with Fort Knox they give you a lifetime warranty on the electronics find out what the warranty is you will use a safe more with an electronic lock and with lights once you buy lights you're never going to go without lights again there's no flashlight on the on the shoulder routine so if you go in and you buy a safe a quality safe and you buy with electronic lock that you can get in in two seconds and excuse me as opposed to 30 seconds to a minute and a half you will use the safe more if you if you buy lights with now you can easily see they come on when you're in there you can distinguish everything from colors of jewelry to you know your guns you can clearly see everything you will go without lights again so you've got electronic right here yes the purpose of the digital is just very simple it's just within a very short period of time is that you're going to be able to get into the safe you hit six numbers in the pound sign and your your in your safe as opposed to the dial where you're going to do four to the left and 3 to the right and two to the left and right until stop now we know all about the EMP you know concerns that customers have and I want to if you have a moment let me let me show you an anti EMP new locking device this is exclusive at this time to Fort Knox I'm gonna turn my back to you as I walk to the back here you okay have a new they have a new redundant lock feature on on a safe cool and the redundant lock is is that you can use the digital lock on the safe and all you use the dial for is to pull the bolt up if you ever had a problem for Knox lifetime warranties their digital law but if you ever had a problem with the digital lock people are afraid it's always going to happen on a weekend or a holiday I'm not gonna be able to get ahold of anybody it turns into a fiasco well now on the redundant lock feature the dial will bypass the digital lock you may use it one time in two years or ten years but you'll never have the capability if there's an EMP blast you got your dial there okay but it's a slight upgrade in cost where the normal electronic lock will run you 150 dollars you're going to pay three hundred and twenty-five dollars you know for a new redundant long but virtually it ensures that you can use a digital lock all the time and if you ever have a problem which is relatively rare a catastrophic failure you can go to your handy-dandy dial that you're not EMP dial and you can you can open up your safe what about children and if you had to put a gun next to your bedside let me recommend what kind of safe I'm really big on personal protection boxes and I want to emphasize to the customers as a person who trained in the police department is that the same electronic locks that I sell in the big saves and ninety to ninety-five percent of my customers are buying electronic locks they're totally inappropriate for a personal protection box an electronic lock is designed to get you in in two to three seconds the personal protection boxes are designed to get you in in a second so now if you have a stress situation where you need to get in one of the things that's going to happen to you is you know you're going to get scared when you say holy smokes and it's probably not the words you're going to use this is the real deal and so what happens is all of a sudden you get your adrenaline up in your hand shaking that if you press the electronic locks too fast and you keep on doing them what you're going to do is literally lock yourself out it's a recipe to get yourself killed biometrics are very haphazard in in usage only work about 60 70 percent of the time they are very fussy the inexpensive models aqui forget you trying to find a key in getting in the only lock in my opinion and we all have our own opinions this is my I've got about Telly's I love this thing it's just a perfect lock on a safe quite simply your your control you're in in a matter of a second so what's that rule it's a generic if you make if you make okay now if you made a mistake on a simplex lock and you press the wrong buttons it doesn't work voila you turn to the left you now have cleared your bad code and you can do that as many times as you make a mistake take a deep breath you saw here you are two and four one we're back in our lock again now this is the only lock that I recommend to go on these saves further the only heavy-duty box made on the market today is by my buds at Fort Knox who now have added from their one to do a couple more and they're doing three big versions of this over Christmas time they took the smaller version in the bigger version of this I got them coming tomorrow by the way and so what happens is is that you have now for the customer that wants something for a vehicle cool you have something that right now will house three or four guns ammo all kinds of stuff you put in the vehicle you can put it at home bolt it all up I just can't tell you how much I love these boxes and now they got their first of their single long gun versions of the unit now this one is designed to lay flat on the floor okay or to be put in the vehicle for transport you just add you know you just we send them to an auto body place that through bolt into the car so again put this under your bed yep absolutely now in the future they're going to make a model that's going to open up to the side so they just made five different models this has been a long time project of ours I'm very big on these boxes I don't like the import stuff because to be quite frank with you the metal Windham doesn't do anything I don't feel comfortable leaving a kid with an import safe you know in a room alone I just don't these ones excellent Medellin my last question Kurt is the delivery process I was always so impressed with how you deliver these things a bigger Fort Knox safe for instance what is your process on delivering them well I pay my guys very well to do a job and basically what it comes down to is is that you know we specialize in this we got a quarter million dollars with the trucks we pay our guys good money to deliver what good benefits to come in your house do it right you have to bring three different types of metals you know to places you have to build ramps you have to put blankets on the floor with titanium aluminum plates that are very expensive very cigarettes here and so we have no markings on our truck if you're in a security business one of the things that earns me is to remember that I'm in a security business I would love to drive my truck around town and say another safe sold by CSAs it's worth tens of thousands of dollars instead of since since we've been in business we don't have any markings on the truck they say see II incorporated you know on the truck they have to be marked by DLT standards in our state but there's nothing that says safe on it we think that if you're in the security business you should be really quiet about what you do and so you don't want me parked in front of your house saying safes all over the truck going in if I was ADT and warm company you wouldn't care okay but coming in and having a truck parking thing saves it just shows that you don't understand your business and so one of the things that we try to do in this business in a market that has been flooded with with inexpensive what I consider to be many poorly made safes out there we try to emphasize the better and we try to emphasize doing it right and sometimes a small thing can turn into a big thing Kurt thank you so much I want to reiterate your website is below and if anyone from the United States calls you you'll school them on the telephone you'll direct them to a vendor in their zip code and you do deliver throughout the whole state of Florida personally you're yourself the shop correct and then will assist a customer any way that we can you know as far as there are certain areas we can sell to and there's certain areas I have to make a referral to you for the our website our new website address is Cee safes with an S on the end comm and our email site is ze safe set gmail.com very simple to find thank you so much I'm proud to be here I enjoyed my time thank you", "37Kn-kIsVu8": "a few months ago a patron of mine contacted me because he saw one of my old videos where I separated gold from computer parts he was wondering if I could do a video like that again except on jewelry and he wanted to send me some gold covered chains and an old Rolex he had no idea how much gold was actually in any of it but he was pretty sure there was a decent amount I thought it would be fun to pull out whatever was there even if it weren't very much but I did have one concern before this I never tried extracting gold from jewelry and I was a bit worried that I might mess it up this is because with gold even a small loss can start to add up quickly for example this here is five dollars worth and it's such a small amount that you might not be able to see it on I know I really didn't know very much about the whole process but I didn't think that I could screw it up that badly so I had him send it all over to me and it arrived about a week later it was a huge mess so I went to organise it a bit and almost immediately I started doubting that these were just gold covered chains the gold plated stuff is usually made from a cheap metal base like copper silver or steel and the density of these are about half that of gold most of the chains though were really heavy and felt way too dense to be made from any of those metals when it was all organized I saw that I had five chains a watch face and a bunch of scrap stuff the first thing I did was take a look at the watch and they noticed that it was still working the fact that it was still functional and that it probably didn't have much gold or any other precious metal in it anyway I really didn't think it was worth destroying so I put this on the side and I moved on to looking at the chains the first thing I wanted to know was the purity of gold in each of them and to do this I just looked for a stamp I was able to find one on three of them where two of them were marked as 18 karat and the other one was marked as 14 one of the smaller ones wasn't marked too though and the clasp of this one had broken off where it was probably written so now because I didn't have a real idea of what these chains were made of I had to test them there are a lot of different ways that this test can be done but I just used what I had on hand which was concentrated nitric acid so to the big chain I made a deep scratch in it dropped it in the acid and left it there for a few minutes gold jewelry comes in different carats and it refers to the purity of the gold 24 karat is a hundred percent and everything else is based on a fraction of that so for example with 18 karat gold it means that the pure fraction is 18 / 24 or 75% the other 25% is often made of other metals like copper silver or iron which both change its color and make the gold more durable nitric acid is able to react with most metals and dissolve them but some metals like gold are really resistant at lower carats below around 8 or 10 the acid can eat around the gold atoms and dissolve the other metals however when we start getting up to 12 or 14 karat the gold is able to block the acid this is why even after sitting here for a few minutes pretty much nothing happened a deep scratch also didn't do anything either so together this told me that not only was it not plated it was probably at least around 14 karat now using the same test with a piece of the smaller chain it was a different story and the acid immediately started attacking it it also changed colors where it was initially blue and then it slowly shifted to being green because of all the copper nitrate that was forming about 10 minutes later there was almost nothing left and it was mostly just some light black flakes from this I took a small sample and I added it to a test tube then I diluted it with some more water and I added some concentrated hydrochloric acid and almost immediately a whole bunch of white stuff appeared which was probably silver chloride this told me that well there was silver present and that the chain was probably just a mix of copper and silver the last thing to look at was all this scrap but I didn't bother testing it because none of it felt very dense at all I just assumed that it was all less than 14 karat and I decided to process it separately for now though I put it aside and I went back to working on the chains I now had an idea of how much gold was in each chain and I knew that this one probably didn't have any gold at all I decided that I would still process it though but I would do it with all that other scrap stuff to process these chains though which actually had golden them the next step was something called in quotation this just meant that I had to mix it with another metal like copper or silver to knock down the gold concentration typically the target is around six carats so about 25% by doing this the gold stops being able to block the other metals from nitric acid and you'll see why this is important later on the most common and probably best metal to encorte with his silver mostly because it's very easy to recover and to use in another run however I didn't have any silver and this was just a one-time thing so it made no sense for me to go out and to buy some just for this I instead just used copper that I pulled out from a bunch of wire that I had left over after moving to my new office I then weighed each of the chains and based on their purity I calculated how much copper was needed to knock it down to around that six carat point for the larger one that I determined to be at least around 14 karats I went ahead and assumed it was 18 just for the calculations I did this because it was better to overestimate how much copper I needed than to not add enough now to mix the copper with it I had to melt it all together I'd done this before on a very small scale in a porcelain dish but never with this much metal there are many different setups that people used to do this but I wanted to go with the simplest and the cheapest from some videos that I saw I found that it was possible to just do it with a paint can some blow torches and fiberglass insulation so I ordered the fiberglass from Amazon and I went and picked up the torches in the paint can from my local hardware store also Walla was on Amazon I picked up this small metal melting starter kit now to put this whole can thing together it was really easy I just had to cut out a small circle to cover the bottom and then I cut a larger piece to cover the sides of the can for the torches I drilled a hole in each side and shove them in I then put a crucible that I had inside turned on the torches and tried to position them properly to try to keep the heat inside I covered the top with more fiberglass and I waited for it to warm up as a point of safety though some torch ads like the one I have on the right are made of brass for general use this is totally fine but in this case the tips of the torches are surrounded by insulation this causes them to heat up way more than normal and with brass it can start releasing toxic zinc vapor for this reason I did it all in a fume hood but it probably should have just avoided brass altogether my torch head on the left is made of steel and I could have just gotten another one but anyway after 15 minutes or something it didn't even look like it was close to being red-hot I honestly wasn't very surprised by this and I assumed it was because the can and the crucible were way too big for these small flames the simple solution to this was to just build it using a smaller can the one issue with this though was that the only crucible that I had that would fit in this was made of graphite I wasn't sure if it was okay to use with torch flames but I figured I'd give it a try I did a test run and I was able to get it red-hot and it didn't look like it was getting destroyed by the flame so I let it cool back down to room temperature and I started loading it up with the copper and the chains it only had space though to fit one chain and it's copper so I'd have to wait for it to melt a bit before adding more so I put this inside my little can thing turned on the torches and covered the top within just a few minutes it already started glowing red and to get it going faster I blasted the top with another torch then I let it sit there for a little while more and it eventually started to melt there was still a bunch of solid stuff left in it but it was liquefying there was now a lot of extra space so I started adding more copper and gold I started with the small 14-karat chain and all of its copper and it might have looked a bit weird here and this was because to make sure that there was no moisture on any of the metal I preheated it with a torch I really blasted it a lot though and the chain melted a bit into the copper I waited for all this to melt and then I added half of one of the larger chains along with half the amount of copper it very well might have been possible to do the whole thing but it didn't really make much sense to try there was still a third chain to do which definitely wouldn't have fit and it made no sense to risk overflowing it if I had to do a second run anyway but in any case with everything added I covered the top again and I waited for it all to melt when it eventually all liquefied I stirred it around really well to make sure that all the metals were evenly mixed after that I covered the top and I heated it for another few minutes just to make sure that it was nice and hot and then I poured it all into a can full of water when that was done I dropped the crucible back in and I set up the second run just to make things go faster and to make sure that there was no moisture in it I gave all the copper and the gold chains a strong preheating then I slowly added everything to the crucible at first I just did this with the tongs but I found that doing this for all the copper would take forever so I just started pouring it in from a vial it was a lot faster to do it like this but it wasn't nearly as accurate so I ended up missing with a bunch of the copper however this really wasn't much of an issue because not including just a small amount of copper wasn't gonna make much of a difference when it all eventually melted I mixed it around like before and I let it sit for a few more minutes I then went to pour it all into the same can but I was a bit surprised because liquid metal started coming up from the side of it before the front this definitely wasn't a good thing but for the time being it was still a bit too hot for me to investigate so for the time being I put the crucible back in the can and I turned off the torches and I let it cool when I took a look at it a few hours later I noticed that there were some huge holes in the side of it which were made by the torch flame this is why you aren't supposed to use oxidizing torch flames on graphite for long periods of time was lucky it didn't end up being a problem but it could have caused the crucible to break when I tried picking it up this could have not only caused all the gold dispel everywhere it also would have been a huge safety hazard but anyway getting back now to what was thankfully not a catastrophic failure all my gold alloy was now in this can so I just quickly got rid of all the water and this was what it was like by dumping all the liquid metal directly into water it created these pieces that have relatively high surface area ideally though they would have been a bit flatter and looked more like corn flakes but I think I just didn't pour it from high enough in the can just sitting on the fiberglass I also found this chunk of alloy which had leaked out the side of the crucible so I took this along with all the flakes and I put them in a beaker then on top of all of this I pour it in some dilute nitric acid a reaction immediately started and some nasty nitrogen dioxide vapors started coming off the nitric acid was attacking all the copper that I Justin corded it with as well as any other metals that might have been mixed in with the gold in this case the other major metal that was used was probably just silver there might have been small amounts of other metals though like nickel zinc or iron the nitric acid converted the copper metal to copper nitrate which like I mentioned before has this really nice blue color as the concentration of the copper nitrate increased though it slowly shifted to being a dark green the silver and other trace metals are also being converted to nitrate salts and getting dissolved into solution the silver nitrate is colorless though and there isn't enough of the other metals to really affect the color when the reaction died down I added another load of dilute nitric acid and it started bubbling like crazy again  I waited for this to also settle down and when it was done I dumped everything into a larger beaker I then kept adding more of the dilute acid and I continued the same cycle as I mentioned before I'm using dilute acid here instead of the concentrated stuff and there were two major reasons for this the first one is that it stops the reaction from getting out of control and the second one is that I needed the extra water to dissolve all of the metal salts that I was making here a major effect of this though is that compared to the concentrated stuff the reaction is slowed down quite a bit which makes it take a lot longer so to speed things up this reaction needs to be heated usually close to the boiling point I didn't use a thermometer though and I thought I was close enough but I don't think I was and because of this it would initially react quite a bit when I added more acid but then it would kind of just stop however just by looking at the stuff at the bottom I could tell there was still a lot of copper left at the time I thought that maybe the acid was just depleted so I dumped off the liquid and I added new fresh stuff the same thing happened again though so I started getting suspicious but still I decided to dump everything off and to add more fresh acid again this also eventually stagnated so I dumped in even more but it didn't seem to do too much it was only at this moment that I realized I probably wasn't heating it enough so I cranked my hot plate to maximum and the difference was pretty obvious I let this react for another hour and it got rid of pretty much all of the copper just to really make sure that it was all gone though I boiled it one last time with more nitric acid except this time it was a bit more concentrated when it was done about 40 minutes later I dumped it all off what I had now was this really soft gold sponge but it was still contaminated with a lot of the dissolved metals to get rid of them though it was quite easy and I just had to wash it with boiling distilled water I did it three times in total and after the third one it was still a bit blue but that was okay now that pretty much all the other metals were gone I added concentrated hydrochloric acid I brought this to a boil and then I started adding small amounts of concentrated nitric acid on their own neither of these acids are able to dissolve gold but together they make something called aqua regia which is actually able to they work together where the nitric acid starts by oxidizing an extremely small amount of the gold to make gold three plus ions this reaction is really unfavorable though and almost immediately after they're made they revert back to being metallic gold with the hydrochloric acid present though it can attack the gold three plus ions and convert them to chloroauric acid this breaks the equilibrium between the gold in the nitric acid and the gold ions are continually fed forward to make the chloroauric acid I kept adding nitric acid until it pretty much looked like all the gold was gone and then I left it overnight the next day I still had some solid stuff at the bottom but it wasn't gold it was all just silver chloride because apparently there was still some silver left in the gold so moving on I diluted it with an equal amount of water this is done just to knock out any silver chloride that might still be dissolved then on top of this I added some concentrated sulfuric acid to knock out any lead that might be present when we're finding jewelry there usually isn't any lead to begin with but this was just a precautionary measure as far as I could tell though nothing happened because there was no lead I let this stir for about an hour and then I filtered it off this was done by just using a couple coffee filters and the solution that passed through was really nice and clear when it was done I watched the filter paper with a lot of distilled water because as long as it was yellow it meant that there was gold in it when I eventually had a completely colorless filter paper I took away the funnel and I dumped all of this gold solution into a larger container I also watched the beaker a few times with distilled water to make sure that I transferred everything okay so now the next step was to get the gold out of this solution and to do this I used potassium metabisulfite I made a solution of it by adding about a hundred and twenty grams to two hundred mils of distill water I thought this was enough to dissolve everything but it wasn't so I just kept adding more water until it all disappeared normally I would have just dumped in all of the metabisulfite but I thought that maybe it could be interesting to add it drop wise the moment I did some brown gold powder started precipitating out but it wasn't particularly interesting so I ended up just scrapping that whole idea and dumping in the rest of it the potassium metabisulfite is a reducing agent and it reduces the gold in the chloroauric acid back to its uncharged metallic form it also reacts with leftover nitric acid though which is why it was important to use a minimal amount of it when I was dissolving the gold other metal salts like those with copper or iron won't be reduced by this and this whole step was to help further purify the gold as one point of safety though this reaction releases quite a bit of sulphur dioxide gas which is dangerous to breathe I'm personally really sensitive to it and even very small amounts can trigger some asthma symptoms so for this reason it's extremely important to do it in a well ventilated area and I did it in my fume hood I then let it sit for a couple hours to fully react and for all the gold to settle down to the bottom  this was what I had a few hours later and I dumped off all the water all of the gold was then transferred to another beaker with the help of a bunch of distilled water this was all brought to a boil and after heating it for a couple minutes I dumped off the water this washing step was then repeated four more times using boiling distilled water at this point the gold is usually pure enough but I want to get it as pure as I possibly could so I decided to do another washing step except this time with boiling hydrochloric acid when the concentrated acid was added it became yellow because an extremely small amount of gold was able to dissolve the amount like I said though was extremely small and it was nothing worth worrying about this was brought to a boil and I repeated the same thing four times and each time the solution became more and more colorless after the last one with the acid I did it two more times with boiling distilled water now just as a quick comparison if we look at the gold before the acid and afterwards it's quite different the color of it is a lot lighter and apparently this indicates a higher purity I poured off as much of the water as I could and then I put it back on the hot plate to dry it  when most of the water was gone and mixed it around a bit and I let it sit on the hot plate for another several minutes I also occasionally stirred it and eventually I was left with a really dry powder this was more gold than I had ever held in my life and when I weighed it it came out to be about 75 grams based on the carats of the chains I expected to get about seventy seven point nine grams out so this was extremely close this estimation was based on the assumption that that unknown chain was 18 carats though but it probably wasn't also the amount of gold in the other chains was probably slightly less than the carats they were marked with now the next thing to process was all that other scrap I didn't include this with the main batch because I wasn't sure what was in it so I wanted to process it separately it all seemed to be plated or low karat gold though so there was no point in in courting I just jumped right to adding the nitric acid and like before there was a big initial reaction but it quickly died down I then added the liquid from the test that I did earlier on the piece of that small chain I also added the full chain itself that was most likely just copper and silver this was all boiled for a couple hours and when it stopped reacting I figured it was done I poured everything off and I washed the stuff at the bottom a few times with distilled water it looked like almost everything had dissolved except for some of the stuff that was completely pleated with gold then just like before I poured in hydrochloric acid waited for it to boil and added small amounts of nitric acid  eventually almost everything had disappeared but the solution was green here and not yellow because there was still a bunch of copper I let this cool overnight and in the morning I poured in a bunch of water then I mix it around and I also added some sulfuric acid after this I let it sit for about an hour and then I filtered it it was the exact same setup as before just with a funnel and a few coffee filters it was eventually all done and now the next step was to see how much gold was actually in there so now to this I added a solution of potassium metabisulfite until all of the gold had precipitated then I mixed it around and I let it sit for a few hours when I came back I poured off all the water and it was way more gold than I expected I really didn't think I was gonna get much of anything out of it but this was a pretty decent amount I now had to clean it up a bit and I did the exact same thing as before where I started with water washings then I did some acid ones and finished with some more water ones I dried it on my hot plate until it was a nice and crispy gold powder and then I weighed it like I said before I really didn't expect to get much out of this and I was really surprised that it was almost 6 and a half grams all of this was then combined with my other gold powder and my total now was eighty one point six grams at about 42 dollars a gram USD this is close to thirty four hundred dollars or about 4500 Canadian this was way more than I ever imagined I'd be extracting for my patron considering when he first pitched it he just said it with some gold-plated stuff however I was really happy it turned out this way because it made the project a lot more fun but in any case the last thing that I had to do now was to melt all of this powder down into a solid chunk to do this it was pretty simple and the first thing that I needed was that small porcelain dish that had gotten that kit from Amazon then I picked up some borax from my local hardware store and I also got up my torch this dish had never been used before so I had to give it a glaze this was done by first getting it really hot and then sprinkling small amounts of borax onto it the major purpose of this was just to prevent the gold from sticking to the dash when I felt that I had done a decent job I started adding the gold I was a big concern that the torch might blow the powder away so I swapped it for the less intense one the gold was dense enough though that this didn't really seem to be much of an issue so I ended up going back to the other one the gold started melting relatively quickly and I just kept topping it up with more powder and occasionally with some more borax when I was eventually done I was left with this giant blob of gold I let it cool for a few minutes so that it would solidify and then I knocked it out of the dash  I dunked it in some water to cool it down quickly and I also washed it a bit to get rid of any borax residue the final result was this giant chunk of gold with a mass of 80 1.31 grams this was a bit less than the powder that I started with for those probably because the powder still had a bit of water or moisture left in it as I mentioned before this was more gold than I'd ever held before and because it was so dense it also felt abnormally heavy now that I had this huge piece of gold I wanted to do some tests on it I had always heard that gold was really malleable and soft compared to other metals and I wanted to see for myself I did try bending it with just my fingers but it was absolutely impossible so I moved on to using tools the first thing that I tried was to push on it with a steel spike and I was kind of able to stab it in with a hammer though I was able to smash it all the way through and when I took it out I had this nice little hole in it  the next test was to smash it with a hammer and see if it would flatten gold is definitely malleable enough to do it with the right tools but doing it like this just isn't gonna work very well the only result that I really got was a bunch of hammer marks in it and it didn't get much flatter now the last test was to see if I could cut it with a pair of pliers with some soft metals this is easy to do but the gold was relatively tough I was able to pull some very small pieces off but that was about it I did find it funny though because even though these pieces were really small it was still something like 10 to 20 dollars worth of gold from these few tests I saw that the gold was definitely malleable but it wasn't nearly as much as I thought it's still enough though that making something out of pure gold might not be the best idea with jewelery things like rings and chains would definitely deform over time and potentially break this problem is fixed though by mixing it with other metals like copper silver or iron which greatly increase its durability but anyway the piece now was all mangled and I just couldn't leave it like that I wanted to fix it up and I thought that it would be cool to make some small gold bars so I put everything back into my dish and I started melting it and at the same time I heated the graphite mold that I got with that kid on Amazon when it was all liquid again I picked up the dish and I carefully poured in some of the gold  you  then I took out the bar by just flipping the mold upside down and I moved on to making another one  and after that the last bit of gold was just enough to fill one of the smaller ones I quickly knocked out this one as well and I cooled them all underwater and this was my final result they were of course really far from being perfect but I still liked how they turned out from all the nitric acid waste I was also able to recover some silver and I made another little bar with it I didn't feel like it fit in this video but if you're interested in seeing how I got the silver out and dealt with all the waste in general I've put together another video this one though isn't posted on my main channel here and can be found on my other one called Nile blue and there's a link in the description as one final thing after all this I went to a company called kit Co and I had them test the purity of both the gold and the silver they initially told me that they were both a hundred percent but they didn't know that I wanted a printout of the results so I had them run it again but this time the results were slightly different the silver was still a hundred percent but it said that the gold was 99 percent and the rest was tungsten however I think this was just an error because if I got out a hundred percent of the copper and silver there's no way there would still randomly be one percent of tungsten in there when I posted this a patreon a few days ago one of my patrons Victor gave a good explanation as to why it might have told me there was tungsten the gold was tested by something called x-ray fluorescence or just XRF and he said that sometimes it can get confused between gold and tungsten this is because with XRF the tungsten and gold Peaks are very similar another patron found these two XRF results for tungsten and gold and you can see how some of the peaks slightly overlap Victor also told me that I didn't even need to in court for this video and there's another method that can be done where the jewellery is directly treated with the aqua regia this method would not only save a lot of precious nitric acid it also might be a lot faster and it has way less copper waste but anyway in conclusion I was able to extract the gold and I didn't totally screw it up the only sad part now is that I don't get to keep the gold and I have to send it all back to my patron but either way sending it to me in general was still really nice and well trusting so a big thanks goes out to him for that if any of you guys are interested in just donating your gold to me though I'm definitely open to it now before I go I just wanted to quickly mention that I also have an Instagram account I post a lot of stuff there some of which never makes it to this channel and I also post stories which cover some of the projects that I'm currently working on and if you were following me you would have known that I was working on this whole gold project I also sometimes post some really high quality content like this as well so you should definitely consider checking it out as usual a big things goes out to all my supporters on patreon everyone who supports me can see my videos at least 24 hours before I post them to YouTube also everyone on patreon can directly message me and if you support me with five dollars or more you'll get your name at the end like you see here  [Music]", "L1JK_LLM_xw": "From being filled with nuclear waste to shattering on impact, here are 11 of the most insane bullets in the world. 11: Dragon\u2019s Breath Rounds Dragon\u2019s breath rounds consist of mostly magnesium pellets and shards. These are considered some of the coolest and most exotic shotgun rounds ever! It is not considered a tactical load and is really just for fun although it can be quite dangerous. When shot through a gun barrel, the magnesium reacts vigorously with oxygen to produce a streak of white light and heat, which can extend up to 30 meters (100 feet) basically turning your firearm into a flamethrower. The spray of flames resembles a dragon\u2019s fiery breath, ergo the name of Dragon\u2019s Breath. They are pyrotechnic shotgun shells and may look cool particularly in the dark night sky, but these pellets are no joke. They burn at 3,000 \u00b0F (1,650 \u00b0C) which is sufficient to engulf your target in hellish inferno. I don\u2019t think I have to say this but just in case, do not ever do this in your house!! They are an extreme fire hazard when used in dry areas, especially outside with lots of dry wood and grass. But, those in favor of Dragon\u2019s Breath claim that magnesium pellets can also serve as distress signals and that these rounds can be a less-than-lethal option for home defense. Clearly, if you happen to fire these rounds, you might end up burning down your house, the intruder, and yourself. This makes them illegal by default in some US states such as California, Illinois, and Florida. 10. Hollow Points Hollow point bullets have exactly that. A hollowed out shape in the point of the bullet which causes it to expand as it hits its target, causing more damage to tissue. They are outlawed for use in warfare, and in many countries and states in the US, but they are used by some law enforcement personnel, and ordinary gun owners in self-defense. Why are they banned in the first place? Because they can expand, explode, and fragment inside a target\u2019s body, maximizing damage and pain. Normal shots, which are fully jacketed and rounded with a smooth surface, penetrate a target without expanding. If the body doesn\u2019t reduce their speed sufficiently, they just pass through. On the flip side, hollow points stay put. Once they pierce a target, they mushroom, slow down and rarely pass through so they can be controlled and prevent collateral damage. For example if they are used to shoot on an airplane. When they are taken out, they leave an abnormally large hole. Law enforcement agencies employ these insane bullets for various reasons. These shots rarely leave the human body, thus posing less risk to bystanders. It is also recommended for self-defense. It seems a little counterintuitive that the bullet that causes more damage is chosen because of their safety for everyone involved. Well...except for the one that gets hit...but most likely, they deserved it. 9. Railgun Projectiles Actually, who needs bullets at all anymore?? The US Navy electromagnetic railgun is essentially a super weapon!! This futuristic projectile is safer to stockpile than explosive ammunition and much cheaper. The railgun can fire a hardened projectile and blast anything it hits like a meteorite from outer space. Railguns are experimental devices that use electromagnetic fields to launch high-velocity projectiles at a target. Years of research cumulated in the 2010 test at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Virginia, where BAE Systems fired a 3.2 Kg projectile at 33-megajoules. One megajoule is equivalent to the energy produced by the impact of a one-ton car traveling at 100 mph!! Now picture 32 airborne cars, aimed straight at you. The railgun-fired projectile hit targets 100 miles away. The railgun has cost about $500 million dollars since its inception but because they are so dangerous, they have not yet been tested enough to be used in battle. As the Navy has developed the electromagnetic railgun, it has also been investing in hypervelocity projectiles (HVPs) which is a low-drag spike that the railgun can use for ammo. How\u2019s that for a bullet?? HVPs can be fired using other types of weapons so now the Department of Defense is actually much more interested in the projectiles than the railgun. These HVPs can fly through 7 steel plates, no problem. Plus, they only cost about $25,000 per round, which is peanuts when you consider that a Tomahawk or Harpoon missile costs over $1 million per unit. While the US has been losing interest, other countries haven\u2019t given up. As of last year, January 2017, Russia unveiled a deadly electromagnetic railgun that can fire bullets at 3km per second. Did you catch that? Per SECOND. Also recently, it came out that the Chinese had a ship with their own electromagnetic railgun. In the future, railguns could become commonplace since they reduce the need for explosives. Ironically the railgun which causes so much destruction, is actually safer. And now for number 8, but first, who do you think developed bullets with nuclear waste?? Write your answer in the comments below!! And be sure to subscribe!! 8: The .577 Tyrannosaur For those not acquainted with the T-Rex: It was one of the deadliest carnivorous dinosaurs, with teeth the size of bananas. What\u2019s more, it could swallow 500 pounds of flesh in one bite. If you want to learn more, just watch my video on the largest carnivorous dinosaurs of all time!! The .577 T-Rex rifle carriage is not a dino, but it\u2019s equally deadly. It\u2019s an insanely powerful bullet made by A-Square in 1993 for professional hunting guides in Zimbabwe. Tasked with the risky job of protecting clients on hunting expeditions; they needed a bullet that could stop a charging animal, like a furious buffalo, or an elephant, instantly. A-Square\u2019s solution was a 14.9 mm, 49 g solid projectile that dwarfed other hunting rounds. Only the company\u2019s monster Hannibal rifle could handle the shot. As is to be expected, several people on YouTube have attempted to fire this monster, with sometimes funny and other times painful consequences. Why? Because the shot produces a powerful recoil that leaves the shooter reeling in agonizing shoulder pain. The impact is more than one and a half times the force of a gunshot in the shoulder with a .22 hollow point bullet. So, if you have a loaded Hannibal rifle sitting by idly, remember that medical care is not cheap. Especially if you live in the US. 7. Nuclear Bullets After the collapse of the USSR, the media started reporting on the presence of a mysterious weapon developed since the 1960s. According the original article which was published in Russian, Soviet physicists were producing nuclear bullet fillers out of an element called californium. To cause a nuclear explosion, Uranium-235 or plutonium-239 is enriched up to 90%, and through fission and fusion: Voil\u00e0, Major Explosion! However, the explosion will not occur until you have a critical mass of the substances, around 1kg for uranium and plutonium. But, they are not the only radioactive materials that can cause a bang! Californium, which has a lesser critical mass of just 1.8 grams could be packed into small containers. Like bullets. Californium used in the project was possibly derived as a by-product of nuclear weapons testing by the Soviets at their infamous Semipalatinsk Test Site, also known as \"The Polygon.\" It\u2019s alleged that their atomic bullet was about 14.3mm to 12.7mm, making it suited for arming heavy machine guns. Supposedly, they also engineered smaller 7.6mm bullets to fit in Kalashnikov assault rifles like the AK-47. When one thermonuclear bullet exploded, the heat could liquefy an armored tank. Several of these insane bullets could vaporize a brick story building. I\u2019m not 100% sure about that but that\u2019s what the reports said.... Radioactive substances are unstable and must decay to become stable. This process produces lots of heat so the Soviets had to refrigerate their nuclear bullets at all times and use special vehicles to transport them. There was always the danger of the bullet getting stuck in the barrel or even self-detonating resulting in radiation exposure and death. Can you find these legendary bullets on eBay? Um probably not, but researchers speculate that some are in private collections or museums. Some claim that it\u2019s just a hoax and they never existed in the first place. 6: Depleted Uranium Silver Bullets While Soviet nuclear bullets read like science fiction, depleted uranium bullets, DUs, are pure fact. These rounds penetrate through thick hardened steel, making them the ultimate tank killers. They also ignite spontaneously upon impact, due to the pyrophoric nature of uranium and steel. If you\u2019re fighting an enemy with DU fire, a fast-moving and well-protected tank is not the place to be. Why use radioactive nuclear waste as ammo? Tungsten is also used for anti-tank rounds, but it can shatter on impact at extreme velocities. Depleted uranium rounds, on the other hand, vaporize armor, and explode inside with a devastating effect. NATO armies are notorious users of DU rounds in conflicts overseas. Truth-seekers assert that big players in the nuclear sector have colluded with the military in order to dispose of toxic wastes in hostile countries. Back in 2001, the UN found fragments of depleted uranium ammunition in Kosovo. These bullets, dropped by US pilots, are suspected to be the cause of high rates of leukemia in the region today. 5: Flash Thunder Grenade Ammo The Flash Thunder Grenade Ammo is not your typical shotgun round. A shot produces a blinding flash and an extremely powerful blast of 182 decibels. At just a little more, 195 dB, the human eardrums rupture. Jet planes taking off only produce 165dB. Therefore, this insane ammo can cause permanent hearing loss without adequate ear protection. It\u2019s being used by some Special Forces units to storm buildings during military operations. 4: Macho Gaucho Rounds Macho Gaucho rounds mimic the appearance of the \u201cbolas,\u201d a device made by linking two heavy balls with a string of one-to-two feet. Gauchos or South American cowboys have used this contraption for hundreds of years to hunt game and capture cattle since it entangles the animal\u2019s legs causing it to trip. The concept has been carried forward to the 21st century in form of deadly 12-gauge shotgun rounds. Macho Gaucho Rounds can cause devastating damage to targets. You can find several videos of the round being fired, but the balls don\u2019t always stay connected. 3: Jihawg Ammo Labeled as the most controversial round in the universe, the Jihawg Ammo is the subject of much criticism and ridicule, even in the gun owning community. Its creators, believed to be some Idaho gun owners, were sitting around a campfire enjoying their drinks. They were infuriated by the construction of a13-story Islamic center in Lower Manhattan, two blocks from the World Trade Center bombing site, also known as Ground Zero. They sought to find a way to counter any future insurgents. Their solution: Create bullets considered Haram, or forbidden by Allah. Somehow they convinced South Fork Industries, a dyeing and finishing company, to take up the challenge and infused paint with the meat of domestic pigs, which was subsequently coated on standard 9mm caliber rounds. During the ammo\u2019s release in 2013, the company stated that \u201cWith Jihawg Ammo, you don't just kill an Islamist terrorist, you also send him to hell.\u201d Of course, they became highly controversial. The company fired back saying that their ammo was not to be offensive, but defensive. Shannon Dunn, an assistant professor of religious studies at Gonzaga University, weighing in on the matter, stated Muslims unknowingly hit by South Fork\u2019s bullets might not be banned from heaven. 2: Punt Gun Shells The Punt Gun is the largest shotgun ever, used avidly by wildfowl hunters in the 19th to 20th centuries. A typical punt gun averaged 8 feet 4 inches in length, weighed 43 kg, and had a bore diameter of 2-inches ( 51 mm) By all standards, this was a very large gun. In some old pictures, you\u2019ll see two men carrying the gun on their shoulders. They would mount it on a small skiff boat called a punt, and the hunter had to maneuver the entire boat to aim the gun at a flock of fowls. The large bore diameter ensured it could fire 500 grams of shotgun pellets, which could kill up to 90 birds in one go. Its invention and use were to quench the insatiable demand for bird feathers in the fashion industry. Naturally the populations of wildfowl were greatly affected and the punt gun was outlawed. 1: G-2 Research R.I.P. Bullet Topping this list of insane bullets is the Radically Invasive Projectile, nicknamed the \u201cRest in Peace\u201d bullet. Many consider it the world\u2019s deadliest bullet, and the manufacturer markets it as \u201cthe last round you\u2019ll ever need.\u201d Its lethality stems from its unique tip, which allows it to shatter upon impact producing shards. The manufacturer, G-2 Research, claims that the bullet can open nine separate wound channels in a target, and obliterate vital organs. Get this; they made them for women who are living alone and anxious about their family\u2019s safety. Those who have tested R.I.P bullets on various targets such as sheets of metal, glass, plywood, and blocks of ice, have marveled at their damaging power. So, unless you\u2019re battling zombies, lock these bullets in a safe. Thanks for watching! We would appreciate your thumbs up, and remember to subscribe!", "vmnLA2DuYJs": "I'm retired Navy SEAL sniper instructor Chris sign OGG and founder of the new rules of marksmanship in this video I'm gonna teach you how to grip your pistol properly now let's go ahead and get started  [Music]  the importance of a proper pistol grip cannot be overemphasized what I want you to think about anytime you're shooting a pistol is making it an extension of your body don't think about your pistol is just something you're holding on to and trying to control really make it part of your body and if you use the techniques that I describe here it's gonna feel that way a proper shooting grip is the cure for the common recoil one of the things I'm going to talk about in a little bit is not letting the tail wag the dog okay before I get to that let's go ahead and show you how to set up a proper pistol grip now the first thing that I want you to do is always start with your pistol outside of any holster just start with it in your non-shooting hand put your shooting hand up on the back of the beaver tail is high up as you can get it and you want to have your skin tenting up up there don't make it so high that it's going to interfere with the slide but as high up as you can possibly get it and that's gonna really help ensure that you are supporting the gun as well as possible because the energy when this gun fires is going to go straight back now because of the way these firearms are designed you cannot put your hand directly behind that energy so we want to get it up as high as possible to have a mechanical advantage now when we do that you also then want to make sure that your arm is directly in line with your firearm with the barrel of the firearm so you can see my arm is in line with that and this is why it's so important to start outside of the holster because when most people grab a firearm from the holster they'll grab it like this and they'll pull it out and you can see that I am nowhere near in line with that so that means the energy is going to be coming straight back in forcing my elbows to bend in my whole structure to break down okay so we're not going to do that so grab the gun place it in there ten up your skin get your arm is straight back as you can behind the gun to support that energy now you'll see my thumb is forward here if you look at this space in here you can fit your hand by panting your reaction hand or your support hand down at a 45 degree angle and placing it right into that space so what you want to do is you want to take away any spot on the gun that that energy could go to because energy is always going to go to the path of least resistance so if I have an open space in here the energy is going to be forced into them so say for instance I have a little space right here where the energy could go to and I'm allowing the gun to do that well some of the energy is going to push back this way and I'm going to be pushing to that side we don't want to do that so we are going to cover this up as much as we can hand down at a 45-degree angle and you'll see my thumbs are forward and that is a perfect pistol grip now I talked earlier about not letting the tail wag the dog now this is one of the biggest misconceptions or pieces of just bad information that I have heard for over 25 years in teaching firearms and that is that your finger needs to go a specific place on the face of this trigger and that could not be further from the truth the place this came from is that professional shooters with very heavy guns and very light triggers they didn't need to worry about having a good grip and they didn't need to worry about manipulating their trigger properly all they had to do was just touch that trigger and the gun was gonna go bang but on self-defense pistols like you are shooting that gun to trigger weight ratio is the difference that makes shooting harder so it's going to be more important that I can control the gun with a proper grip if I grip it properly and and I grip it hard I can do pretty much anything I want to that trigger and it's not gonna move but if you're trying to put your finger somewhere on a trigger where somebody tells you to like the Hat of the tip of your fingers something like that it's not gonna work for you all right you need to set up your grip first and then let your finger land where it may on the face of that trigger and that's going to be the perfect spot for you remember we're all different as shooters so with that some things that you can test to make sure that you are in a good shooting position number one is point your gun straight up and your thumb of your reaction or support hand and your trigger finger should be about even if they are like this or like this that's going to mean that that your grip is canted one side or the other another thing you can do here is let go of the gun with your bottom fingers and the gun should stay straight so that means that the top of my gun I'm supporting it as well now when I teach a pistol grip I teach a 100 and 100 percent grip because if you're in a competition if you are shooting at somebody who's shooting at you you're gonna be holding your grip with 100 and 100 percent grip strength I guarantee it so why not practice like that it's the most stable thing to do you don't have to worry about a 60/40 grip or a 4060 grip you don't have to worry about some crazy push pull with your different hands just grip the gun hard imagine if you put your gun in a vise you could do anything you want to that trigger and it's gonna go where you want now another way that you can test to make sure that you have a good grip especially having your arm behind the gun here is just bring the gun up and look down the sights and just squeeze the grip as hard as you can and you'll see my gun is shaking because I'm literally squeezing as hard as I can but if I can't my gun off to the side so now I'm one of these people who grab their gun like this and now I squeeze the gun you can see what's happening is the gun is going off to that side so that's going to happen every time I shoot this gun if I grip the gun like that now if I were to have it over like this and it's too far off to this side now when I squeeze the gun is naturally going to be shooting to the left people all the time are saying oh all my shots are left and low or whatever all of these things can be diagnosed by yourself and fixed right at home by using a proper grip a couple of the last ways that you can check to make sure that you have a proper grip are are you shooting consistently in the center of your target if you're not one of the first culprits could be your grip so make sure you check that and you're doing it properly when you shoot does the gun jump out of your hands and what I mean by that is I'm shooting and the gun goes bang and you have a big recoil because you don't have a proper grip and then you find yourself keep having to readjust your grip if you're always readjusting your grip on the range you're not starting off with the proper grip so make sure you're doing them a little piece of bonus advice and that is to work on your grip strength it's super important the stronger your hands are the more you're going to be able to control that gun input rounds where you want to so that's it for now until next time keep paving your path to perfection hey I really hope you enjoyed watching that video and if you did I put together my top three videos for learning to shoot at home and I want to give those to you absolutely free now all you have to do is click the I card that just popped up or you can go to Kris sign on Comm forward slash free videos and I will send you not only those top three videos that I

those videos keep paving your path to perfection guys  you", "5rYPRMm8Arw": "I've been asked how I am finding water when I dig a well it's pretty simple what I use many people disagree with it say it doesn't work I'm not here to change anybody's mind I'm just telling you what I use and what works for me and again this is only for shallow wells something both let's say no deeper than 30 feet and my secret weapon is coat hangers dowsing rods and what I use to make these work correctly so I don't have to wonder from my thumb or fingers are helping or that it's rotating correctly drinking straws take a drinking straw cut it in half slide it over in slide it over and I don't let my thumbs touch I don't grab tight and hold it don't let my fingers rub on this you want it just to come up and they're very easy to rotate within these straws you want to keep them  perpendicular to the ground or just up pointed down just slightly because you don't want to work against and I'll go out as I'm about to do another well out where my I have some bees and I need to make sure that they're having plenty of water and it's further that I want to tote it every day and I'll have a further demonstration once we get out there  I've marked that spot  okay what's happening here is real interesting it happens every once in a while I'm getting hit on a line which means to me which has been my experience there is an underwater stream right here  it might make more sense if I come in this way again it's kind of comfortable perpendicular to the ground just a little bit lower walk up they start to cross now just kind of like put a foot marker right here which means I could dig anywhere on this line and I'm gonna hit water because there's a stream of sorts running underneath here the other thing that will happen occasionally is  instead of them crossing we get a little closer instead of them crossing like this you may go pass something and both of them go like this or like this in me is I need to go that direction back towards where the water is and once I start going that way they will cross again a lot of times this will point you in the direction that you need to go now sometimes it I've done this where I can't find anything I mean I'm not getting any hit this just so happens it has bit this has been about the easiest I did I started and as soon as it I started getting hits on the water and I bet if I start going across like this probably about three or four more feet it's going across there direct line so since I have been fortunate enough to find what I believe to be blowing water underneath here I'm going to try to find a spot that's convenient for me  particularly point sand that's the way it is been for the whales that i did\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00b4t another part of the property so what convenient for me this area because I can keep it out of the way and it's convenient so let's see what back we'll come back up on that line  okay scuff in the ground back here  I get another line I'm just gonna pick me a spot I'll pick me a spot this could be on this line now that we got everything ready start on our wheel  [Music]  okay thanks to pay attention to as you're digging as I started it's very sandy here of course as you see but I got down to a little over five feet in the sand it's changing color SEC I mean I'm getting to a different kind of sand I'm getting to clay whatever but when you're digging pay attention to the changes in the color of what you're digging because that can give you clues as to what you're about to get into weather getting closer to water whether you dig somewhere else around on your property you may have an idea of what to expect and the difference between the original auger with having to use a pipe wrench and everything to take stuff up with this method right here making these extensions out of square bar tubing just move sprinkly up they handle off  but extension here reattach spring clip  put your handle back on  but just friend clip in and you're ready to keep rolling  so we're down a little over 10 feet now it's starting to get into the clay and usually you get there you get to the other side of it and in that sand on the other side of the clay or Rock that's where you get to start getting water so I anticipate anytime  this thing's starting to get a little bit wet  it's also important that you try to keep things straight up and down perpendicular you starkey crooked you're gonna have problems putting your pipe in later on  what we're done about now 13 feet we've started to hit water not late it's really really wet with really rough sand mixed with it squeeze it out here's a tip especially if you're working by yourself because this can get 50 dog Oh heavy get to the point we help control this thing if you've made one of these with the detachable pieces the square tubing just take the handle off it doesn't seem like that weighs a lot but you don't have to balance it up in there and it makes it a whole lot easier  and you don't have to worry about hitting you ball head on the way down  there you go when you get in the water there's gonna be a lot of suction and it is not gonna want to let you pull this up so to help get it started you need to do is you need to twist and pull at the same time to break that suction loose and that's a little harder to do when you're trying to pull the handle off so you'll just have to work out it's all by feel you'll feel it let go like I said right now I'm pulling up on it and twisting and it is not letting go  okay there we go knows a part of the joys of working place okay we're finished not that you can see anything down in there there's our varying bits of soul I wanted to go deeper I'm about eighteen feet which is not very deep but I got four feet of water in the hole but here's the reason I went ahead and stopped and this is from experience this right here there's green clay this is out of focus clay and you get in this and it goes on for a while and it is tough and it is slimy and it is a lot of work and I'm not gonna gain anything by killing myself going any further I just need to be able to get a little water out of this thing to take care of my bees and water a plant or two around here with old cistern pump so oh one more thing  this is why you pay attention when you dig it's broken right off in here that's oh it's an old spearhead that came up find lots of arrowheads and spearheads around here this is one he came up about I don't know I was about four or five feet down and got it well next we're gonna put our pipe in the hole okay here's our PVC casing pipe that's gonna go on the ground it's about 20 feet long because I got about a four foot water table in the hole I just come up from the bottom a little bit get this in you'll get our pea gravel around it and we'll pack dirt back around it and our casing pipe will be finished under then capping it off and then we will put our pump pipe in okay so we just about ready now what I like to do when I fill the hole back in of course first put the pipe in then I put the pea gravel in to be higher than the level of the notches I cut in the the four inch PVC then I start replacing the soil that came out of the ground and what I do is I start from this and me from what came out last and work my way up to what came out first as you can see I haven't got half way through and I'm already full you know also like this one here sometimes I do it beforehand I will clean around the bottom of the the hole where I'm digging this one here was a lot of nice grass and I just left it there now I'm through digging the hole and I'm filling in I go in and I've chopped all the the grass around it I'll pack this here down and then we're going to cap it with concrete a bag or two of sack Creek should be fine and what that does that causes the water not to be able to run down into your well it will run around it it's just another way to seal it off we get that done and hopefully tomorrow we will be able to get the get our other pipe in and go ahead and put the pump on  once it gets close to the Bob you'll feel it once the slack goes out of it you've hit the bottom there's mine I'm at the bottom so what I like to do is take it and tie myself a little knot right there so I know where the top of my case is let's bring it back up  right about there so  I've got almost four feet almost four feet of water in there so what I need to do is measure this cord from the end of the top and be about one foot shorter because we don't want the bottom of our whale pipe to be touching the bottom of our case and being say it I've already cut my pipe these shallow wheels this is one of the most important things that you can have to save you all kinds of trouble this is a foot bowel and what it does is it allows water to come into your pipe and it will not come back out so your pump will always stay Prime so then the next thing we need to do is lower this down in our whale  and I'm using one-inch pipe on this piece together this is a scrap whale  okay what I don't want to do lose this  you know I can grab it  the other thing I've done is like went and got a flat a four inch flange for a drain or a toilet it's gonna be easy to sit to stay in there and then just kind of forward to set on top nice let that thing sit right in there down nice and tight okay it does not get any easier than that right there so as far as your well being you're done with with this part you don't have to worry about stabilizing or anything then your pitcher pub one thing would be easier to do is it go ahead and prime it go ahead and get water in that pipe so you're not fighting to bring it up water down in our pie  I'm hoping that's enough water I may not have got enough but then we'll take our picture pop attached to the top of our pie  we'll see we got enough in their prime  and we don't I might get some more water to help this thing get prize okay we had to get some more water because I have enough to private thing but we I look at this as a good training example not to freak out if it doesn't work there's not water and you can prime right through your pitcher club to just open it up and pour through  you're gonna have to pump and pump and pump until you get rid of all that because that's all the stuff to spend disturbed at the bottom it will take a while eventually it will clear now what I do  so I have to worry about this thing moving I'm just going to attach it to my block up here  it's good to go and if you notice the being started I already I put my concrete at the bottom and the reason for that is twofold one you want to keep your whale clean you don't want brown rock water running in it bring your contaminants in but to think about this way you have opened a hole in the ground exposing water down there you want to be a good steward and not let stuff get nasty so you're you're not only keeping your well water clean but you're keeping water clean and other people may end up using so now we'll just let this thing sit get it cleaned up in my job is to pump this thing get it cleaned out and we've got another wheel okay we're gonna wrap all this up we've got it installed we got it aground we're getting water I still need to clear mine but we're not going to do that here I just want to close this up with a few tips to help you in some problems that may come up with all this that seemed to come up with all of them one make sure all of your connections your your PVC glued connections your teflon tape connections all those are tight if not they will leak a little bit you'll loose Prime and you'll have problem with your pump too if your pump after doing it this way and having the foot valve on the bottom if it continues to loose prime probably what's happened is the dirt or sand or whatever that's in the bottom of the Year whale has gotten into the foot valve and it's keeping it from closing all the way which is allowing water to run back out it's not a big deal pull this off pull your pipe out take that foot valve apart there's one screw it takes out you can clean it out get the sanded junk out put it back together drop it back in it should be fine  finally keep a bucket or a container of water near your pump until it is given you continual water it can be quick prime of this thing where you can continue going and eventually hopefully you'll have one that you don't have to worry about I've got one of those around here it stays primed all the time so good luck what you dig in hope this helps um and I'm gonna get out of here because it's starting to rain happy digging"}
