{"QeHGDr81XwM": "Hello friends in this video I will show you how to heat up a camping tent with a Finnish-style log stove also known as a Finnish log torch there are several methods to heating up a camping tent without a portable metal stove you can set up a long log gap fire outside the tent just close enough so that the heat would radiate through the tent wall also you can heat up a large rock and bring it inside the tent you can easily find a large rock in the root ball of a falling tree even in a snowy forest but this video will demonstrate how to heat up a camping tent using a stream of warm air from a metal pipe running through a Finnish log torch I have already tried this method using traditional campfire but was not happy with the results this time I'm using a Finnish torch with a curved pipe as a modification to the prior method I should say upfront that I was pleasantly surprised how well the tent heating method worked this time first of all we will need a metal pipe for our experiment I used the curved steel pipe from the headrest of a vintage metal bed the headrest was rusty so it took me some time and effort to disassemble it into parts and clean them both outside and inside okay now we have all we need to conduct the tent heating experiment in the snowy forest a pipe thermometer and wood I stashed a few dry segments of a fallen fir tree last summer so we could save time on cutting it now I left the wood segments wedged and suspended in the original log so they could stay dry now we need to make a Finnish log torch the log torch unlike the Finnish log candle keeps all the fire inside the wood segment it burns slower and more economically to maximize the economy and duration of heating are the two characteristics I want to achieve in this project there are many ways you can make a log torch but I'll use the easiest one it is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit -12 Celsius outside and all the moisture in the wood freezes so it becomes fairly easy to chop wet wood as the frozen moisture swells the log from inside however my log segments are dry because they were kept suspended above the ground so it isn't that easy to chop them without a wedge to make a log torch tent heater you need to chop a segment of wood into three or four large pieces and remove the cool portion of each piece just enough so that you could loosely feed the pipe inside the formed channel because I was chopping wood for two log torches (for two experiments) I got warm real quick my trusted Billinas #9 Finnish axe rose to the challenge I think it is one of the best multi-purpose axes out there I even used it to build my log cabin at Ladoga Lake traditionally you would reinforce a Finnish log torch with viza a rope made from fir branch I will leave a link to my video about how to make such bushcraft rope below this time however I will use my homemade clamper and steel wire as it is a lot faster time is valuable in the northern winter forest because the day is short and I need to assemble two log torches and my tent before dark the reason I need two log torches is because I need to test two metal pipe shapes a single-bent pipe and a u-shaped pipe we will try a u-shaped steel pipe experiment first obviously we would have to insert the U-shaped pipe into the torch's triangular opening before clamping the torch assembly once I added legs to this log torch it became heavier but it is still fairly mobile I can easily pick it up by its legs and carry it to the tent in order to heat up a tent, well, we need a tent)))  this means it is time to set up my tried and tested tent model UP5 it is a spacious camping tent for five people almost a small studio apartment with no pesky neighbors and a great location however it won't be easy to heat up such a large space which makes the experiment even more interesting and trustworthy my double wall russian-made tent has an umbrella-like frame that allows you to set it up quickly now it is time to fire up our log torch as I said earlier I nailed three legs to each log torch for better air flow and stability next I cleared a small spot from snow so that the log torch wouldn't fall on the tent once the snow melts under it I didn't have a shovel so I just stomped and pushed the snow aside with my legs I was glad I had my custom tailored gaiters on they prevented snow from getting into my shoes and getting my feet wet I will leave a link to the gaiter template below in case you're interested as you can see I nailed the legs with their longer portions at the bottom and checked the torch assembly with my weight however I decided to install the torch upside down to use its longer leg as a pipe support this way the metal pipe will be suspended in the air and it will not press on snow under the torch or the torch's inner burning part I made a V-cut on the tip of a former leg and now the heating pipe is well secured you can also use two nails to secure it if you don't have a sword to make a V-cut the easiest way to start our log torch is to plug the central hole at the bottom with a piece of bark then stuff it with dry branches and wood chips it only takes one match to start the fire then I didn't do a great job chopping and reassembling the log segment into a torch with no radial gaps this means the fire will eat up the torch faster through those gaps which is why I put some snow in them to prolong the torch's life once the log torch reaches its cruising temperature you won't see any flames outside the torch's walls inside will slowly burn which in turn will heat the fresh air inside the pipe that is flowing up to the tent note the fresh air gets into the pipe below the level of the log torch preventing any carbon monoxide from mixing into it it is freezing outside and the long aluminum pipe cools off quickly if the first pipe segment is too hot to touch the second segment that is closer to the tent is noticeably cooler to improve the torch's efficiency I decided to move it closer to the tent and this is where I made a mistake I didn't push the legs all the way to the ground and I faced the consequences later my tent has two entrances so I could use one door to run the heating pipe through and use the other one for all other needs note I'm not forcing the airflow in any way yet the airflow is significant I'm using a small feather to demonstrate it admittedly my tent is large and it will take at least an hour to heat the top through such a small diameter pipe without supercharging this is why it's still freezing inside the tent but I make it to wait to see if this tent heating method works so I decided to take a short nap in my cozy sleeping bag I was napping for at least an hour and a half before I got out of the sleeping bag to measure the air temperature the air got really warm inside the tent even though I forgot to close a small chimney hatch which means it would have been even warmer inside once I put my shoes on and looked outside I saw that the log torch fell on its side because I forgot to push its legs all the way to the ground the log torch melted snow and evenly which caused it to topple I'm glad I didn't put the torch too close to the tent as it would have burned a hole in the wall even though the toppled log torch could have still worked longer I couldn't wait to test a single-bend-pipe design of this method so I prepared and fired up my second torch to save time I used the same legs with nails but this time I used my clamper to reinforce the log torch over the legs as well which pulled the log pieces together even tighter resulting in smaller gaps between them thus resulted in longer burning time also thanks to the additional metal wire clamps the torch ended up being extra strong I got a little carried away jumping on it to demonstrate its durability ))) I think I might adopt this simple idea of just clamping parts together with steel wire to make primitive log furniture for my cabin I hammered two nailes at the bottom opening to prevent small branches from falling through it it was easier and faster to start the fire without a U-shaped pipe sticking from the opening another advantage is you can easily move a burning torch from one place to another something you couldn't really do with a burning campfire this is why I decided I like the single-bent pipe method better because the U-shaped pipe cannot be removed from the burning torch if needed it is 10 degrees Fahrenheit -11 Celsius now the efficiency of such a log heater depends greatly on the temperature gradient in other words the greater the temperature difference inside and outside the tent the better the air flow will be I reached 57 degrees +14 Celsius inside and that is considering I didn't call the second door fully so there is a 47 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Celsius temperature gradient to be honest I didn't expect such an impressive result I would dare to suggest you can reach tropical temperature values in a small tent the temperature of the air coming out from the pipe is definitely higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit degree +60 Celsius unfortunately my thermometer scale maxes out at 140 Fahrenheit +60 degrees Celsius here are a few words about the methods safety firstly there is no fire inside the tent secondly there is a constant fresh air flow coming into the tent you are totally protected against carbon monoxide poisoning because the pipe gets the fresh cold air below the level of the burning log torch also a log stove can be used for cooking food even while it's heating up your tent I personally like the single-bent pipe modification of the method better you can put the pipe in or take it out at any time which makes it easier to start the fire to cook certain dishes or to carry a burning log torch to another location however the U-shaped pipe scheme gets the fresh air from the side and if a small burning ember falls through the torch you won't smell any smoke inside the tent from my experience even if that happens you can barely smell any smoke inside the tent so my conclusion is this it was an interesting experience and successful experiment it is labor consuming but safe and effective besides carrying three short metal pipes is a lot easier than carrying a portable metal stove while traveling in the snowy wilderness I think this method can be further improved if you have any thoughts how you can make it even more efficient please write it below I would love to hear your suggestions lastly if you extinguish a locked torch a little before it is fully burned you can get yourself an unusual piece of primitive furniture I haven't quite figured out how I could use it let me know if you have any idea what can be done with it the log torch idea has a lot of other practical applications for example I recently published a video about an original bushcraft dish that I called a vertical shish kebab it is a skewered spiral potato with a hot dog inside I have grilled the dish on the campfire many times and always found it delicious however the vertical cooking method has its advantages firstly you don't have to rotate the skewer yet the dish cooks quicker and more evenly secondly skewered dishes cooked in the vertical stove taste better than kebabs cooked on traditional grills regular kebabs drip fat on the coals causing it to taste and smells slightly burned while kebab dishes cooked in vertical stoves do not drip fat on fire but rather self -basting which enhances their own taste when I cooked my skewered spiraled potato dish the seasoning fat ran down the potato as it cooked basting it with meaty taste I don't think I can go back to traditional horizontal grilling a more detailed instruction on how to make a vertical stove and prepare food in

you back on Adovoko MAKES", "yPL6jOa6AH8": "hey everybody welcome back from classic work today we're going to talk about one of the most universal pieces of equipment that you can own is a speed square we'll talk about some of the simple things about a speed square its main purpose is to lay out lines very very quickly and very efficiently and accurately so the first thing since it's a square it's made to bump up to the edge of workpiece and scribe a 90 degree line to one edge now another thing that you can do with the speed square is it has this long 45-degree leg on it and it's the same process you can bump it up to the edge of the workpiece and scribe a 45-degree line off this edge another cool thing that you can do with the speed square is this guy to built in quarter inch increments for ripping stock you can pick one of those slots say if you want to cut two inches off of the board you would get to the two inch slot and drag your pencil and the square down and you'd have a two inch line from the outside of your board another great thing about the speed square is it's also a protractor if you see all these numbers here on the side of the square - to use the protractor what you have to do is is on all squares they have what's known as a it says pivot on the top side it's got a arrow pointing to the corner to use it you're going to pick a edge that you're going to bump it up to and holding the square real firmly you're going to pivot the square in any direction and hold it to wherever you want that that line to be say if we wanted one 45 degrees I'm going to try to draw a parallel to this one you'll read on this side of the protractor - 45 degrees and just put that mark right there on the edge of the line of the board and then you'll scribe your line and there's your 45 degrees the great thing about the protractor is it can do any degree from one two ninety another great thing about the square and a lot of people don't know this unless your professional contractor is what are all these numbers for yeah common up here and then you have hip value right here the common stands for your common rafter lengths on pitches of roofs and the hip value stands for the hips and valleys that you have in a roof and those rafters have to be cut a certain way I'm going to teach you everything that I know about all the common okay we got a little model here of a rafter and for demonstration purposes let's just say that the tail of the rafter down here uh maybe a squirrel got into it and eight side of it off and your face is falling down and it just you know looks bad and you need to patch this so you need a small section of rafter here to scab back on the side so you got something to mount your fascia to so on this model here if you do not know the pitch of the roof which is you've got to know that to cut these one really cool trick that you can do with the speed square is take you a speed square and a plumb bob and come up to the roof of your building and take the plumb bob and put it right there through the pivot that we used earlier for the pro chart protractor now make sure that your plumb bob is not hitting anything and that's you know it's moving freely it's kind of close quarters here but what you want to do is is come and look where your line is going through the protractor numbers here now from what I'm reading is it's about thirty two that's about thirty two right on now from that this is what can do take a look at your square and here's 32 right here if you count the number of degrees from the center point which is 45 to the 32 it will give you your picture your roof check this out you have 45 to 40 is 5 10 32 so we have 10 11 12 13 degrees okay come back here to the end of your square and count 13 degrees to find your pitch so what you're going to do is we're right here at 10 11 12 13 now it's really hard to see because you don't have a board coming up through the side but if you lay your square down simply get a good look at this if you lay your square down and go to 13 degrees you notice that your common rafter is 3 and that's our pitch is a 1 to 3 ratio so now we know that we can cut our rafter okay now we can do our layout for our rafter I've determined that we're going to come up 5 inches from the back here from the tail and Mark a line take your speed square and extend that line about an inch and where you can see it real clearly now to cut the seat cut which in the previous rafter that's what set on the wall to keep the rafter from sliding off the roof and to give enough surface area to nail the rafter to the roof we're going to do we're going to cut what's known as the seat cut or some people call it a bird's mouth all right what you're going to do is take your square and put it right there on that line that we just did and get over here so you can see we're going to take the square and put it back to what we said our common was which is three so you line the edge of the board right here if you can see it in the middle to that three and scribe your line one and a half inches which is a two by four and put you a big ol arrow there so you don't get confused then you're going to take your square turn it over and put that square right there on that line that you drew and also excuse me a second and also to that inch and a half mark you made and now you're going to put a 90-degree line from this birds mouth seat just roll it all the way down the side okay and that's the angle that you're going to cut for your bird's mouth now up here on the ridge you're going to do the exact same thing set this time is you're going to take your square and put it on the other half of it and turn it let's turn it two three on your common and then scribe your line which I've already done now this way you know that this line right here and the bird's mouth seat right here or parallel to each other and that's critical whenever you're making these these cuts because roof needs to be very straight all right we're going to cut this and see how it fits okay now we're going to check the fit that we just cut and see how close we are all right don't get much better than that folks  pretty simple stuff to do it's it's pretty amazing what you can do with basic tools and just a little bit of know-how you can move mountains alright y'all take care from classic work see you next time  you", "VAIs8VLFbls": "what I'm going to do here is I need to shift this log roll it so that the heart cracks on both sides are level yeah see this is the heart crack through here generally most logs will have heart crack and I want to cut that I'll just make a mark so you can see it easily yeah I want to be able to cut that out when I start cutting slabs so both sides have that heart crack lined up level I can't roll it this way because I'd be going uphill so you'll be rolling it until it's vertical or until it's all real quite a ways to go mmm so this log is about two and a half feet diameter 30 inches and it's a eight-foot log well probably nine for you I usually cut about a foot extra so this is how the pyramids were built and rocks were moved yeah but a big piece of machinery would move pretty easy but just me yeah if highways  Wow so the heart cracks one in each end they're both slightly different to each other with the casting they play twists the log twisted wood it grew probably yeah so you're kind of find the average I'm finding the average basically I want two four inch thick slabs under this to make a big bench and so fortunately the heart's way down here so I'll probably get my two slabs here easily okay the sides off with my chainsaw because I don't need to do all the milling with my Alaskan mill with that because this is all gonna be exterior so I don't want any SAP wood if it was gonna be interior I would rip the whole thing because then you get all that width but the SAP wood really rots quickly outside so you'll cut the outside off and turn it into firewood yeah just like here just like that very cool  okay I should be able to see enough of that now that it's not look at a straight line how often do you have to sharpen the saw well as long as you don't hit during anything with this kind of work not too often probably every year just four or five times I mean cut yeah it's just so that if the teeth are pretty equally cut and the same angles and sharp the saw doesn't start veering to one side it'll make a cut just pretty straight  another advantage ripping the sides off or peeling the bark off yes when you go to use your Alaskan mill it's a lot easier to cut because the bark really clogs up even where your cut is so I won't have any bark on this when I go to make my gonna be really clean  you have your foot under there when you're cutting down that bar is going through can you see it yeah yeah cut the end your foot off you gotta really watch it yeah when you're doing this kind of stuff yeah sure it's happened before  good they okay looks good so what I'm doing is I'm taking the bark up because I want to set my rail to set up my Alaskan male you don't have to do that but it makes it a lot easier just set that just set it up yeah and de nailed it on cuz you got to nail it onto the log yes so harder through the bark so what exactly is this bar um using is what the bar this is just a bar that's older than I am I got it from my father that's probably 70 80 years old uh-huh this is for its uh originally I think was used for setting best put fence post so you put your post in and then you tamp it down like that around the post  multi-functional oh yeah I must have yeah I use it leverage yeah it's just great for leverage I couldn't move his log otherwise yeah that makes it peel off like a butter  the logs been sitting here for months sometimes it gets a little easier to take off okay what I'm doing now is I'm putting this rail that I've made it's straight and each side is parallel to each side on the rail so if I get this set up correctly I'll cut a even slab off of the blog with my mill so what comes into play now are the lines I've made because that means that I can measure down to this level line that I created earlier on each side of my guide here then on each side over there and then I'll be able to cut down to the line with my Alaskan meal so this you call this a board what do you call this as my guide you guys did you make you use this for all your jobs have you made it for this job oh I use this for all of my milling jobs I made this a number of years ago I have another piece that goes on to it and I can cut 25 feet long so this is twelve and a half inches on this side and I have 12 and 3/8 on this side so and shim it up a little and try to get that  twelve and a half so after I get it all Eve equal on each side I'll nail it to the log so on this side you're also bringing it to 12 and a half inches right yeah twelve and a half inches to the line from the top of the board on each side of my guide and each side of the each side of the log so now I'm at 12 and a half here and twelve and F here now I have to check the other side because I pivoted it may have changed mm-hmm twelve and a half inches from the top of the guide in all four positions on both sides of the log so now I'll nail it down and I can use my Alaskan mill great so when you nail it down are you nailing through those shims on purpose through the sham so they stay in place because the Alaskan mill really vibrates a lot and in my brain out so the nail goes through the guide through the shin and into the log  you just feel make sure it's dirty so you had holes there in the guide before so you kind of use the same holes over over and over sometimes it just depends on where I'm nailing it doesn't matter yeah okay now the one thing I nail the other side AII it just to make sure it's parallel and that's the advantage of having these two two sides mm-hmm and they're very close to parallel I could read this maybe a sixteenth of an inch  so if you want a flat slab like how are you determining whether it's completely parallel in Flash well I'm eyeing this edge get backing up and eyeing this edge and see that it meets that edge so it's not tweaked to is not tweaked in any way right and I'm just trying to raise this one edge about sixteenth of an inch right now I have the two sides parallel now great and if this was a longer log if it was say a 12 or 13-footer over put shingles in the center here then I'd nail it there too but this doesn't have any give in this short distance okay I only need two sets of shingles and nails to keep it accurate enough yeah okay the part where I was measuring the 12 and a half inches from the top of the guide yeah on this nailed to the log yeah because now what I want to do is I want to add up twelve and a half inches here before I put that top board on well first of all let's this is the Alaskan mill this is Alaska mill you can buy setups that are aluminum got bars that an adjustable but they get a bit pricey and you can make your own pretty easy yeah this is my Husqvarna that has a 42 inch bar on it I drilled two holes in it and put in a ready rod bolt folded and stays in place pulled it on both sides with what lock washers and then you just drill this so counter drill it so that it sits on the bar its depth thing stuff to like a step yeah so now I have all these different size blocks and I need to add up to twelve and a half inches so I'm at and I need two and a half more inches so I should have  okay there's 12 and a half so I'll just repeat that on this side so is it a particularly strong saw well it's a good table it's an old so I've had it for over 20 years mm-hmm and it's held up really well it's a big saw yeah so this is what an Alaskan mill is it's not like a it's a chainsaw with a set up on this chainsaw with a set up on it sometimes you have two chainsaws one on each side just depends on how how big a cut you're making and how big your saws are you don't have to have this big ax saw you can have a smaller saw you're just gonna be cutting smaller pieces of wood is all  that will cut right down through that line that I have on the log  I used to use just a 2 by 12 for my guide this works a lot better but a 2 by 12 will work this is about how much well this is an age structure Hou sees a plain bored playing to the instruction structures this is like a beam structure so it's a lot stronger so when I go ahead and make this cut I use a gas mask along with iron ear protection because I'm sitting right next to that motor and the fumes come right up at me and they're pretty toxic so it's a good idea to protect yourself from it yeah why more so than with a regular chainsaw well when I'm cutting with the regular saw my head's quite a ways away from the saw head and there's a breeze going through and so the wind is really taking it off I'm not getting it but with this you're really sitting right in there with it okay so now with the set up I have this board will run down the top of this now I'll be cutting right along this line and it should meet on the other side where the line is - no yeah this cuz everything is parallel and I did it with a level no and that's why I needed to shift the log so that the heart crack I was cutting out was the level tooth and then to this board for the ride along the top of that board yes while you're sewing and the bar will will cut right through that line so we'll see if it does yeah okay okay  when I first put the board on I put it on backwards and there's a reason that I have it longer on this side just for safety I like to have the board go past the end of the bar it's too easy for someone else to walk up and walk into that bar when it's when the chains running and get cut really badly so right now we're looking at how it's going to be while you're cutting right and so if somebody walks up they're gonna get to the board before they get to the the chain moving because that'll cut through you pretty fast yeah okay well I'll get the chain saw started now so just hangs on bouncing on the wood  nice come out in the line yeah good very impressive okay so now I'll remove the nails and then we can cut from the surface that I created we don't need this anymore I like how you put the shims in that makes sense they're as thick as the as the blade yeah if you don't put the shims in it drops down on the bar then you're cutting width and it'll bind your chain what you're gonna make out of this big block of wood on my pond where I have the koi I'm going to take two slabs and make a circular bench area  break your foot I can't live something like this how happy to think the top slices what's that how heavy is the top slice gonna stop sighs I would have to guess just 500 pounds I mean this is Greenwood yeah it would probably break your foot or break your leg yeah so you lever it off oh yeah I can't lift it  so now I'm going to go for cutting a 4 inch slab and so now I just change my block setting to 4 inches perfect and they should both be the same yeah so we got 4 inches now  so you have to be pretty handy to want to do this to be able to do this oh yeah it's quite a bit of work for everyone it's not for everybody but on another hand where can you go buy a 21 inch 4 inch slab that's 8 P or 9 feet long of Redwood that's all hard to cut a bench out of yeah these logs over here actually I'm just gonna be cutting into material like the two by they're in stump or by because I'm going to be replacing a d\u00c3\u00a8cadence 20 years old so that you could just go out and buy all right I've got the material here for big slabs so it just makes sense to use it because I had to take the trees down anyway so a lot of your house you would have made the boards actually no I fell the trees but I had a mobile dimension milk up ah that would be just too much to do yeah that's uh I had a twenty seven thousand board feet of material cut up so that was like a look like a lumber yard I wouldn't be able to do yeah the most I've cut off it any one time is about 3,000 feet that's a lot of work  okay now I can cut off of this flat surface that I've created for my next 4-inch slab so you don't need your border you don't need the board you only need it the first time for the guide for the first guide yeah because now I can you look at this it's a really nice flat surface I mean it's really nice straight and flat super plain yeah so you wouldn't use these shingles until you're actually working along you just place them ahead of you yeah yeah just get them in place  mmm mmm mmm mmm  pretty good it's quite dangerous there I mean you're using your your foot it could be you have to be very very aware of what you're doing well it helps push it down there because you are actually pushing it and it's kind of hard to reach over and push with your arms the whole day I know yeah your legs a lot stronger yeah okay we got a slab beautiful so I'll take it off and put it on some stickers they're parallel with each other and so that it dries fairly flat  oh nice board nice board huh ready for another chicken ass and then I should miss C on both sides  wow it's sure looking different around here cutting these logs there's just a little bit more to cut but some of my piles are very close to where the log is so I'm gonna be moving this wood to another location and then I'll finish cutting up that one log there ah sorry it's only about a foot away from your stack of wood right I need quite a bit of room for the saw because the blade extends you know a couple feet so maybe you've got like 30 or 40 boards here since we were last with you oh yeah yeah I cut up this time in a combination of two by and four by I just cut up according to what my usage is going to be yes so I have to replace a deck and so I'll need some 4 by material and then a lot of 2 by so that's how I decided to cut this time so on top of the pile there's like a thinner board yeah what I do often is I cut out the center where the heart goes through because often there'll be a crack through that and it makes the wood not usable so I'll cut like I cut just an inch out here and it's just not a very usable it's not reusable so I just cut that out because I don't want that crack to go into the next piece like this was the next piece uncut and it's a floor boy and I don't want that crack going into it so then I just use it as the cover board I see there's a little crack there in the end yeah crack here you can see it a little more clearly these are a couple more that I'm not you seeing right now cover boards but see this crack mm-hmm see it goes diagonally vertically in some areas and kind of diagonally oh yeah making the wood pretty useless in that area yeah except for a cover board yeah cover board good and I might you recover a little bit of the wood but not much yeah then sometimes you notice that one's even it's one inch everywhere this one goes from about two inches to one inch yeah sometimes the crack that goes through the heart which is typical in most trees you'll get that mm-hmm it doesn't it's not going parallel with my cuts the way I laid out the log it twists it'll twist as it moves through and this one twisted a bit so there was more waste on one side so what I do is I just used my guide again that I have right here when I get down to the heart crack and I set it up on it and then I can cut out a shape that I take more out on one side than the other so I don't get that heart crack into the next piece of wood into your primary boards that you're cutting right so now these cover boards will you be able to use them later or like what happens to them with like how many months will you leave these wood piles stats to season it just depends on what the usage is uh-huh the deck I'll probably use it in a couple months mm-hmm it'll dry some it's not essential that it dries mm-hmm because when you go to the lumberyard and buy redwood to build a deck it's wet mm-hmm it just depends on the usage right the one thing about the cover board though is it does help keep the top piece out of the Sun because the Sun does make it crack more quickly and more more quickly until it's dried to some extent so you leave these board these stacks of wood summer on your property out in the weather for a number of months oh yeah with your hoverboard yeah yeah see what happens is if if this is exposed to the Sun before it dries to some extent yeah this top part will dry before this bottom part too quickly one dry evenly mm-hmm and so that that means that part of the piece of wood is bigger than the other part and so then it starts doing all sorts of weird things because it's not dry drawing evenly yeah great yeah so anyway this is the project almost completed now almost completed and ready for me to just so these remaining pieces with lots of bark on them they can become firewood yeah all the rest of the material that I've left that I've cut from already will become firewood just as I have stacked between the trees and this is the one log here that's very close to the pile so you'll shift the pile of wood and I just don't want to double have to double move it so I'll move the pile of wood where it's gonna go and then I'll finish well it sure is interesting yeah it's an interesting way to produce your own wood if you have it you know the trees on your property and you need to take them down yeah yeah not not easy work no not easy work but then on the other hand you either are going to go to work and earn the money yeah to buy the wood or you or you do this and you have the wood you just get all the in-between stuff wonderful yeah yeah very cool great thanks sure you bet go mill your own wood", "onMbSLuC7Oc": "", "AxM9FYSs8V4": "Two Years Alone in the wilderness can make a man lonely", "84mKsMtb_bQ": "[Music]  [Music]  [Music]  oh I'm Ariel welcome to my tiny house bye miss where I live off-grid in the mountains of northern Wyoming I'm gonna show you around today so I walk around for my door here I have these little flower boxes that kind of give me my skirting slush let me plant flowers and herbs and stuff around the house which is nice I've got a propane line that comes into the house here this is for my backup heater and it runs underneath here to where I'll show you the propane tanks I've got a vent for my direct vent propane heater and that has to be kept clear at all winter it is clear now but in the winter that you have to keep that shoveled otherwise you'll have things fumes backing up in the house I keep the the entire perimeter of the house shoveled because I have things I need to get to and vents the entire way around the house that have to be accessed in the winter right now my snow pile is waist to shoulder-high midwinter it was well over my head level with the eaves in spots so there was quite a bit of snow but I did keep the entire perimeter of the house clear just so I could access and fill and vent everything so as you come on around the corner here I've got most of my propane tanks I have two hundred pounder tanks here if you live somewhere cold it's kind of important to have a bigger tank because when it gets well below zero the very small tanks have a hard time vaporizing sufficiently for things to actually draw a propane even if they're not empty so I do have two of these under this little cover I've got two 40-pound ones they work fine but when it gets really cold they definitely will not use the full tank before it stops vaporizing and I use the big ones one of these is connected to the intake I just showed you over there as you come around this side I have the vent for my water heater I've got a ten gallon tank propane water heater so it does have to vent outside that's another thing that has to be kept snow free in the winter and yes the snow did get higher than that had to be shoveled down so that that can vent properly next door is the intake for my water it does have a hookup if I had a pressurized like garden hose I could connect that but I don't and on the other side is just a little intake where I can fill it from a water jug which is what I do [Music] so those just close up to keep bugs and things out [Music]  this is where the power actually comes into the house if you were parking this wherever randomly like an RV this is the main power under the sink in here is kind of the breaker box for the house this cord is actually coming from the other end of the house because this was set up to just run as an RV and when I put in the batteries and all the solar related equipment the only place that made sense to have them was the other end of the house so the power is simply being piped from that end of the house into this end to go to everything else which is not necessarily the way you would design it if you are planning ahead as you can see from the moose scat very close to the house only a few feet away that I do get wildlife very close to my house here in the woods even to the point of having startled a teenage moose that was laying down with his back resting up against the house this winter when I didn't realize he was here and he didn't know I was coming home so the next thing I've got is I have a sink drain that comes out from under the house so you can't see because of the remaining snowbank it does drain directly onto the ground this little wooden tunnel gives it room to continue to drain all winter without icing up with the snow that falls off the roof but it does just drain down pretty much vanishes right away into my very rocky soil that I have here at the top of this little hill but that prevents it just from getting any possibility of getting plugged up with ice over the winter so that's what that box is there for it just moves out of the way in the summer so they don't have to trip over it so right here you can see where my chimney comes out from my little wood stove that's 3-inch pellet stove pipe actually and it seems to work pretty well since I've got a very miniature wood stove it would be better as far as air flow if it went straight through the roof but the wood stove was a later addition for me and I didn't want to deal with cutting in a hole in my roof so it comes out through the wall and goes up and seems to vent pretty well here I've got another propane tank that goes to a separate heater and it was just a little shorter to run the line for it by placing it here versus having at the end of the house where all the other propane tanks are this is my generator zone tiny house it keeps it warm and dry not that a generator really has to be worn but when I had it just under a tarp I had to take the tarp off so it could vent while it was running and then when it would snow while it was running and not tarped ice would pile up on it and melt because it was warm and run down into little things that wear it when it shut off would ice up and not want to ever start again so the little box has resolved all that it also lets me keep a little funnel in the side for filling it with oil or gasoline right here you can see where the power cord comes out of it and runs into the house and I've got a handy little prop right here so that when it's running and it's warmer that's why the flap is here it can be raining or snowing and it can still circulate enough air that it doesn't overheat there is a fully opened end on the well mostly open end on this side which is where the exhaust is pointed so that most of the noise and exhaust sister directed down this hill and directly away from the house so the box in addition to protecting it helps a lot with reducing any audible noise especially from inside the house it's it's a very quiet background noise when it's running as you come on around here I do have a little grill it does not always reside right beside the house in fact in the summer it's out by the fire pit where we do most of the grilling but for accessibility in the winter it is right here I've got a oversized very sturdy tarp just to protect it for the snow loads we get around here but this is a great size for doing you know you can grow meat for several people if you're doing you know multiple different dinner items on the grill at once you know it's still feed two or three last night we had elk steaks cooked on here they were that was from an elk that was harvested here on the property this uses wood pellets it's got a little pellet bin right here so it's a little bit like a pellet stove just feeds that into there and so it both is grilling and smoking meat at the same time and and just gives things a really nice flavor doesn't dry anything out and it keeps everything all the juices sealed inside over here I've got a little what looks like an outhouse and it was once upon a time the outhouse for a logging camp that used to be here I do not use it as an outhouse for me it is my little garden shed which allows me to keep something under a roof that I don't really want to have in the house so let me show you that here I've got just a tarp door there was originally a wood door on here but long before I moved here it had fallen off and therefore rotted into the ground so the tarp door works just fine and inside I can keep things like gas cans water bottles for filling my water tank an extra propane bottle shovels rakes gardening tools all that kind of thing that you don't really want to have inside your house so up the hill here you can see my solar panels it would be a little handier to have them down here beside the house but what I was finding is especially in the winter because I live on the north side of a hill which is not ideal for off-grid life but is the available parking option for my house they just did not get a lot of sunlight down here so they are clear up the hill and you can probably see if the cable runs down through the trees and then into the back of the house where I had pointed that out and that just lets them get a lot more sunlight especially in the winter as you come over this way you can see I've got a large wood pile that is both for my wood stove inside and for my fire pit which is still under snow at the moment outside so over here you can see the top of the frame for my swing set I took the seat off for the winter just so the snow wouldn't tear it up there we've got a fire pit if you can just use your imagination a bunch of little seats and chairs and benches and it's a pretty cool place to hang out in the winter just beyond that kind of from the corner of the woodpile the hallway underneath the dead tree that came down over the winter and to the kind of back of the clearing is about a hundred foot by 25 foot garden which as you can see I can't plant quite yet because there's a lot of snow to melt first okay so that's kind of everything around the outside of my house and now I'm going to invite you guys inside and we can take a look at what's actually in my tiny house [Music]  [Music] okay so in my mudroom here I've got a coat rack as you can see pretty well blanketed with coats pants scarves I do live in a cold climate clearly and I have certainly not minimized down to just one of those so I have a full rack below here I've got shoe storage you can see little hooks here that are great for hanging smaller pairs of footwear and then I've got a mud tray just for boots and other buddy footwear that lets me set things in there so it can kind of drip dry before making a mess all over the house so that keeps that footwear scene kind of contained to the mudroom corner which is pretty nice on this side I've got the living room which also becomes a guest bed the couch was built by a friend and I and there is storage I'll show you in a minute under all of that but the guest bed part yeah two little screws that hold this in place in this whole panel just rest right on the little lip built for it drop in and secure it then the back of the couch fits right there and makes a little lounge guest bed whatever you'd like to use that for if you want to expand that space so that works pretty well for having friends over to sleep on I've slept on it or if you know just a person or two want to lay there and watch a movie together have a little more space to relax underneath the couch is I've got two separate storage bins these cushions just pick up and there's a lid like this this one has random things like my little carry-on luggage extra towels and sheets my tiny little vacuum just a few of those random things they don't have to access real often but they're kind of bulky and it's just nice to have them out of the way in a place like that totally separate and the other part of the L here there's actually a gap of about six inches in between these two bins and this one as you can see has open slots versus closed so it ventilates well because this is my power box and sometimes the equipment running in there does get not really hop a little warm so I want air to be able to circulate and I don't want sheets and towels piled on top of battery cables so those boxes are totally separate this one you can see inside as well okay so first over here is my battery bank I've got five 155 amp hour batteries that's about 500 pounds of batteries that's my storage for all my electricity whether it comes from the generator or the Sun when it's coming from the generator this is a charge controller that lets that power be safely stored in the batteries without overcharging or blowing them up on this side there is a charge controller does the exact same thing for power coming from the solar panels it again let's safely feed into the battery bank and not overcharge in between I've got a little monitor right here that just lets me know what's going on with the batteries how full they are what whether they're charging or emptying all of that and then as power leaves the batteries it goes through this inverter which turns it from DC power back into AC that can be used by any regular thing you would plug into an outlet in the house so above my living room we've got another little storage loft this little cabinet in the middle is you mostly use for food storage I do have a garden when it's not winter and I do can things and you just have to have some room to put those things so that's in there people ask me how I get to this loft I don't have a ladder for it I'm just a little bit tall and I have a couch so this works just fine and I can reach everything in the cupboard and doors in the right order and then just so they're a little you know some files of paperwork things that have to go somewhere and things like that that's just kind of again not super frequently accessed storage but I can get to it when I need to as you come around this way have bookshelves and photograph bookshelves on the two sides here that I love to read I get a lot of my books from the library or borrow from friends or things like that but I did have some old books I like antique books I realized I could have a Kindle and it would take up a lot less space but a Kindle doesn't have old binding glue and brittle paper and I just like those things so I kept some old books some of those my one grandfather who really loved to read that he passed on to me and just some other ones that are either important to me or coal and old or hard to access somewhere else easy to borrow from so that's why I kept some books as well so here's my little tiny wood stove you don't need a very big wood stove to heat a very small space people ask me what square foot adjusts would actually heat I'm not sure but it would for sure do more than my house because this makes it almost at times uncomfortably hot in here which is easily remedied by opening a window it does take very tiny wood this old milk crate is my wood bin this is about the average size of logs that I burn in there and that is probably smaller than most people's kindling you can put four or five of those in the stove at a time it radiates a lot of heat there is tiles on the floor under the stove I know they look like a wood grain but that is actually tile so any little coals or anything that get knocked out are not going to start a fire I've got a little ash bucket right here that was a dog treat tin I believe at one point in its life lets me scoop ashes out again it's metal so if anything hot goes in there it's not going to start a fire the pot on top of the stove I don't use a lot because I tend to create enough moisture in here by breathing and cooking and other things but I think it's really bone dry and I need some humidity I can just put some water in there and let it simmer the chimney again goes through an elbow and goes out the side wall so that I didn't have to cut a hole in the roof and the wood walls are protected by this shield that my local welding shop helped make for me it's just eighth inch steel it's on little feet you can see at the bottom that keep it up about that far off the ground so air can freely circulate the whole way behind it this wood stove is smoking hot right now and this shield is still quite warm to the touch but I can touch it and the wood behind it is genuinely cool so that works really well to keep everything safe and fireproof right around the stove it also does an excellent job of heating the house like I said it's having the air circulate through a space this small just is not a problem I don't seem to need a fan or anything to make that happen and it's a super comfy cozy warm heat for a cold climate up above it here I've got a little sign with my house name on it people ask me out what how I got the name I don't speak Welsh I'm not Welsh as far as I know I just have always thought it was a really pretty language and findeth is Welsh for my nest which is the name I chose for my tiny house so on this side across from the wood stove is my dining room this little table as you can see spends most of its life folded up and compact and out of the way which is very handy when I need a table top or when I have a couple friends over for dinner this little leg just folds out like that the swings out provides its support and the other side does do the same thing I'm not gonna bother to flip the whole table around but I would have to swing the table this way and with both leaves fold it out I do have a really big work surface if I need that for something which is handy though the rest of the time it can be out of the way because it takes up most of the house the other nice thing about this little table is that it has six drawers three on each side that just pull out like this and I use them as places to keep you know tape and paper and staples and envelopes and all that kind of little thing up and down both sides there so it really does provide a great deal of storage and workspace if you need and stays out of the way also my curtains here are blackout blinds I made these myself from some larger like full-length drapes when they were on sale I just cut them up and resold them to fit my windows and they spend most of their time closed so they're kind of wrinkled up but they do a really good job of blocking light if I need them to which is nice and the loft if I need to sleep in or if I just want to sleep to a normal time and it's summer and it's daylight at 4 or if I want other people to not see through my windows which isn't a big deal most the time because there's nobody else around here in the woods on this side I've also got a little backup heater on the tour outside you can see the extra propane line that came into this this was installed before I had a wood stove so now I actually have three heat sources but this is a catalytic propane heater so it is not vented it does create extra moisture and sometimes a slight odor inside so I wouldn't use it for full time heating but it's absolutely great to have as a backup because it does not require any electricity or anything it's a nice warm radiant heat it can heat the whole house up pretty quick and it's not a very expensive heater so that is just kind of an emergency backup thing that is somewhat redundant since I also have the wood stove but on really cold nights because the wood stoves so small and it will burn out after four or five hours if I'm going to sleep all night or be gone at work all day if it's negative thirty something outside I will often just turn that on low as well so that I know the house will not be too cold while I'm gone and once the stove burns out [Music] we're here we've got the my little steep staircase up to my loft there are drawers built into every step here the very bottom one is actually a heat vent but other than that the whole way up of summer soul each drawer gets progressively slightly narrower but so the bottom ones are pretty big I use them mostly for clothing storage folded things shirts socks that kind of thing and there is no real rail but I don't know how well the camera shows this little handle bar here does work quite nicely to be a handrail as you climb the stairs because they are steep and it is a little bit more ladder like over here I've got my TV screen I'm not connected to any kind of TV service but I have an Amazon Prime account and every now and then when my wireless Internet's working well enough I do stream a movie and laying down on the couch this is a pretty great spot to have it and it's out of the way I also have a little curtain across the loft here most of it is walled off this is a cabinet that opens on the other side in the loft bedroom but with wood heat and how hot the house gets and that I like the downstairs to be nice and cozy and heat rises but I don't like sleeping really hot the wall and then the curtain that I added as a temporary measure does block a lot of the heat transfer you can probably see there's open space above there so some heat gets up there but it keeps a lot of it downstairs so when I want to go to bed the lofts not like 4 million degrees so that seems to be working pretty well then I'll show you what is actually behind the curtain  so here I've got my little extra storage cabinet these doors swing out and the mattress is in the way so you kind of have to do that but they have random things like snowshoes and extra foam and some more backpacking gear some things that are not in the van because it can't be frozen but this is just a nice extra little bit of storage and gives me my privacy and heat blocking wall for my bedroom so this is my little loft bed it's hard to make a loft bed very tightly you probably won't find any tiny house often super neat and tidy but this is a four inch thick a very firm film mattress from Ikea which works really well for me my back feels best when they sleep on firmer mattresses plus it's not very thick so I get more Headroom as you can see I can sit up the whole way in my loft and that's pretty nice though most the time I spend laying down on the bed even if I'm working up here during the day I've got this little antique chest off on the side that keeps a few other odds and ends of things like some my old journals some sewing supplies that kind of thing and then I've just got room for a clock and box of tissues and it's kind of like my little nightstand and again when I need to sleep and it's really bright outside because of snow or full moons or just the early sun rises we get it in the summer here in the north my little curtains do a pretty good job of blocking all of the sunlight  [Music] over here you've got my kitchen which is the biggest part of my house I do cook a lot and so when I was designing my tiny house from the start that was the most important thing to me I do have a good bit of counter space for a tiny house I have a knife magnet up on the wall which is nice because it keeps everything organized and out of the way I have quite a few drawers and a lot of storage space here big cupboard that could probably be better organized for all kinds of containers and cookie sheets I use two of these bigger drawers as kind of pantry door drawers for some dry goods items coconut nuts cornmeal sugars that kind of thing I have a 20 inch stove this stove does fit in a pretty compact area but the oven has a good bit of space I can put a my giant roast pan with a 20-plus pound turkey in there you can fit a full-size cookie sheet in there so if you do much cooking or baking you don't have to get smaller than normal pans and and all of that everything will fit four burners this is a propane stove it does a great job of cooking the only thing is because of its size you can't put four giant pots all in the same time you would have to kind of stagger them there is a hood vent with a light and a fan that you can hear kick on so you can vent that as you're cooking above here I've got an open shelf with just all of my pots and pans and some mixing bowls  here I've got more counter space I've got my little fruit bucket that's running low even when it's snowing outside I do some indoor gardening I've got some sprouts starting here in the light from the window those trays I'll stack up so they can be out of the way I have a double sink this is also from Ikea and is absolutely perfect I'm so glad I took the space to put in two sinks because of the volume of cooking I do and therefore the volume of dishes it's just really really nice again I've got a you know off grid system so when you hear the water pump kick on like that it's being powered by my battery bank at the other end of house-this dead corner has the water tank in it that you could see me fill from the outside so that's what's just taking up all the space under the drain board it's a thirty five gallon water tank plus the water heater has ten gallons so that's about 45 gallons when everything is full and again the water heater is run off of propane as well to keep the water nice and hot then I have just shelving for dishes and bowls and plates this little jug I just usually use for drinking water because I like room-temperature drinking water it also seems to work out really handy coincidentally that way if I fill this and a fill the tank about the time I tend to empty this this one gets empty which is kind of nice because there's no visible gauge on this so I have a pretty good idea and again this wasn't planned it just happens to be what I've observed as they use water that I know that I'm going to need to fill this if this is just about empty so that kind of works out well and then I've got some more storage up here for things like oats and lentils and flour and salt I here at the back into the house I've got my fridge and freezer they're not very big but there are separate compartments that's my little freezer that is the fridge it's not stuffed clear full right now it often is but it's plenty of space even when you do a lot of cooking to pretty much get everything in there with no problem I'm sure someone's gonna ask why I don't keep food outside with my massive snow banks why instead have a fridge that is electric and is my biggest power user for my battery bank that would be because of the wildlife I have got bears wolves coyotes foxes pine martens Ravens and just about everything else you can think of that would like to eat food so keeping it outside it's not a very good idea up above here I've got room for things like my big roast pan recipe box small alcohol storage all that kind of thing is right there as you come this way this is the bathroom door we'll go in there in just a minute but I've got this little built-in shelf that lets me keep glasses and mugs and jars and all that kind of thing if I take a step this way I've got my big deep pantry you can see my spice collection on the door I actually have overflowed and there's still some spices in the cupboards maybe I need to add another rack down on the lower part of the door and then these shelves are pretty deep which makes them kind of dark but I can keep quite a bit of things in there and that works pretty well because if you locked me in my tiny house I could probably eat for several months before I started to have to go hungry I might run out of variety but I wouldn't starve so here I've got a little vanity and there's a mirror and behind that as a bunch of little shelves the mirror swings out that gives me space to just store all kinds of you know bathroom products which is handy got a little shelf below there and then my nature's head composting toilets along with my mini tiny house trashcan which is made out of a toilet paper holder which gives me a cute little trash can with a lid as you can see by looking inside it this is not used as a shower normally it works and everything is fully operational but because I carry my water by hand it takes up a lot of energy to to fill that water and a shower uses a lot of water so I usually shower at the gym and do not use this though there's no reason I couldn't if I wanted to so instead it's kind of my hanging clothes storage I do use these higher hangers which are kind of nice if you're anywhere with a small amount of space because the way the hook is set down into the hanger you get a few extra inches of actually hanging space on your clothing and below that is just kind of my other odds-and-ends storage a place to keep toilet paper paper towels extra boxes of tissues folding chairs so if I have some guests over I have that closed drying rack etc so that is what lives in my shower  [Music]  so that's my tiny house again this is fine if which is means - and this is my home upgrade in the mountains of northern Wyoming if you want to find out more info about my house or what I do or a daily life or things that work I think's adult all of that follow my blog finest that's FY n YT H dot blog spot.com or my youtube channel which is Finance spelled the same way at YouTube [Music] you [Music]", "xDnT28Ie1BY": "[Music]  hi I'm Stephanie parem and this is the San Juan tiny house we're down here in Durango Colorado and I'm here to show you our beautiful homes as you can see your house has a curve to the roof and the reason it's called the San Juan is because we named it after the San Juan Mountains the blue it's the river San Juan River so we wanted to be the way with that you know a lot of people have said that our house looks like a boat and you know we kind of joke about that too but the main reason behind it was to add the extra space in the loft so at the base of the trailer it's actually a 24 foot trailer but because we built out onto the nose of the trailer it's technically 26 at the very peak and at the very tip of the house it's about 29 feet so we gained a lot of extra space inside the house let me show you guys the inside  so here's our barnwood sunray which we wanted to represent there's so much sunshine down here in Durango all the time and up here we have porthole windows we wanted to add something circular just to keep things not square so a lot of tiny houses are just boxes but we wanted to make it really different and since we were doing it ourselves we have the time to do that so the portholes were really hard to find but you'll see on the inside they just add a really unique touch all this barnwood is local and then over here on our deck we used aluminum decking because we wanted it to be a little bit more lightweight these are actually two of our solar panels we have more but when we're traveling we wanted to be able to be off-grid so these actually the deck folds up the solar panels fold down and more portable the Greg and I really got the inspiration for these we wanted our doors to be really unique if you know I've spent some time in Europe and I love how the door is such a like that's the main feature of a lot of homeless there and so we kind of stole some ideas off of Pinterest but this was kind of our sketch and Greg was like yeah I can do that so we turned out these funky doors searched forever for some unique hardware I wanted something that's not just stock Home Depot so I really loved how these turned out and it's awesome to open these up in the summer you know even still in these fall days I open these and let's lots of fresh air in and it just allows us when we have friends over to mingle on the deck and you feel like you just have a lot more space so that's one side I'll start by showing you guys our living space which is the most important part of the house well one of the most important everything's important a tiny house I'll just say that I really wanted to be able to feel like I was able to have room to move because our other house is a lot smaller and I couldn't like lay on the floor if I wanted to the most unique part I think of our house is our elevator bed that's something that Greg always wanted to try and we wanted to be able to keep our trailer short but our bed not a loft we had a loft and there's nothing wrong with it but we just were ready for some more headspace so you can see here you know with the elevator bed I didn't want it to just be a piece of plywood I wanted it to be something really pretty to look at when I was laying on the couch so I made this sort of Southwest motif and then yeah it really turned out great we have lights in there and I'll show you guys how it comes down a little bit our couch you know we really wanted to just have room for all of us we want to build a cuddle with the dogs being able to have a guest sleep on here it is long enough for someone who's over six feet our armrest I wanted to double as storage so we have our laptops in here we also just wanted it to be really pretty we did a lot of glue ups since we did all the work ourselves we wanted to have the time and I mean Gregg having the shop he's the owner of Rocky Mountain tiny houses we knew we'd be showing this house off to future customers as well as living in it so we decided to make everything really unique and pretty these are a lot of people like oh are those for plants and this is actually what the bed sits on so and then back here everyone always asks what the hinges are for we just have some secret storage back here it doesn't fold into anything there's just storage behind the couch Greg made this big beautiful circle window we wanted a circle window and when we ain't got a quote on it it was like $4,000 so Greg's being Greg was like I can probably make that and he did turned out really great that's one of my favorite features of the house as well basically everything's favorite feature of our house  so we have two dogs that live in this house with us and so the dog beds are here I wanted them to be able to stow away I wanted everything to be stowed away and then over here as we move into the kitchen like the dog food storage is in here that's also our bench and then our table slides out it's just a butcher block that I whacked so it slides really easy in and out and we wanted to fit four but really it kind of barely fits three and comfortably fits two so but um we just wanted to be able to put it away because we don't often times will disease on the couch so or outside in the summer we like to eat outside on our deck this yeah I feel like a lot of people forget about the dog food storage so that was the big deal for me [Music] so to lower the bed we do have to move some things around Gregg wanted it to be all manual so I've just have to put the TV here have to turn out these wood blocks on the wall and then this is a interesting mechanism it's all manual I kind of wanted garage door opener but Gregg just wanted it to be manly manual I don't know what he was going for but it's really cool he loves all the gears and it is loud so I thought it went up the bed down so it's not as low as we wanted it to be originally but because we have the step here we're able to just pop up and then I also have a little ladder we can use but I really love waking up next to my hobbit window it's the best so we have the TV so that we can watch it when we're in bed and when we're in the living room with the bed up I mean who doesn't like Netflix in bed  so yeah and I'll show you guys how I put the bed back up a lot of people ask if it's heavy but because of the way it's geared it's like maybe thirty pounds if you were to ever like put this in someone's house that was old or something we wouldn't do a manual but since were young and strong we kind of like the little exercise so we just move the TV back  [Music] as we come into the house we have this platform and a lot of people ask why we have a step back step down the feet the main reason for that feature is because our will well is there first of all and I really wanted someone to put all my shoes that I wasn't looking them at all the time because that's what we had in our old house we had this Tower of shoes or any walk tin and just felt cluttered to me so we did this these just tap and open and I've got all my shoes so there's five drawers like this so Greg and I each have one and I like that I don't even have to bend over in the morning to put my shoes on I just kind of like Hickam on cuz I wear dance goes to work and then I really love old floors and old homes I'm a total Francophile and herringbone is really common in homes that are older and especially in France so I really want to do a herringbone pattern the wood in her house is reclaimed Elmwood and we got it locally they mailed it for us and this took us like a full day but I love it not many people notice but herringbone to me is just really pretty in the kitchen we have Greg's favorite feature of the house which are these countertops these countertops are black Texas mesquite and in the grain you can see we have a Sleeping Beauty turquoise which is from Arizona again with the San Juan theme we were paying tribute to the four corners with the motif in the bed the turquoise in the countertop Greg is from Texas so that's part of why he wanted the black Texas mesquite like this is from straight from Texas we ordered it on eBay who knew you can get with slabs on eBay but you can and so yeah and then we found the turquoise at the shop a lot of people ask how we put the turquoise in we had two pipes one that was smaller than the other and you crushed it and then you just poured it in there it was really ugly before it got pretty and then poured epoxy and then we spent like $200 on this insane finish that's supposed to hold up to water so I was really paranoid about doing a live edge countertop I I know they're beautiful but I didn't want a countertop that was gonna need maintenance but so far so good they're holding it really well I love my big think I'm able to actually pile some dishes in there and my other tiny house or old tiny house we had a bar sink and I couldn't even set a plate in there so this was something that was really important to me I do like to cook and I just yeah I'm like I could like probably wash my dog in here baby future baby now we did a 24 inch range to kind of match the 24 inch sink and over here since we did do the live edge I wanted a piece of countertops that I could beat the crap out of not worry about so I did a piece of Silestone we went to a local granite place this is a drop I got it for super cheap looks like marble and you can spill anything on it and it cleans up really well it's my favorite countertop I tell everyone to get Silestone so one of the other things that a lot of people forget when they're designing their tiny houses are things like the shoes where they're gonna put their trash can and their recycling pantry goods and dirty laundry and I fixed all those things in this house and so here I have my trash can and recycling pull out so this but lots of storage here actually most of these aren't even all the way full so over here I did the freezer bottom fridge because I hate bending over to get into the fridge so I really like this fridge for tiny houses I tell a lot of Greg's customers that's my favorite and so the fridge is on top the freezer is on bottom it's just a lot more comfortable especially in a small space you're bending over a lot if you have someone trying to like walk around you it makes it a little bit easier to cook together and then back here we have my favorite double pull out pantry this can fit this fits everything it's awesome just go grocery shopping fits all the groceries all the canned goods all the spices I've got some of our small kitchen appliances in here this was an absolute must because I would go grocery shopping in the old house and I'd have to put like groceries on the countertop and I wouldn't have any room to cook and I'd have groceries under the couch so this was kind of our way to fix that and then we kind of move into our clothing storage back here here on this part of the house we have my closet and greif closet this is also our utility closet so we've got our water pump water heater some other stuff in there got some cleaning products in there Greg likes to hang his stuff but I really wanted roars so I have 10 full drawers he does use a couple and then my my closet here which you can see because I lived in such a smaller tiny house it's not even full and I have my coats but I have got room to grow my wardrobe which is kind of exciting it's the first time in a few years but yeah love how these turned out we did the custom dovetail work and the glue ups once again just because why not we can so we wanted it to be really pretty I'll show you my little favorite barn door ever so with the sunray  and I don't know Gregg just wanted to make a sunray out of the scraps of barnwood left over from the Sunburst on the exterior we did this because we wanted the light to travel through the house so even when this was closed we'd have privacy but still allow some of the light to travel through so it didn't feel as dark kind of got a little dark in this hallway so that was a reasoning behind that in our bathroom we both like to take baths so we wanted a bathtub and we found this sweet tub it's I think it's 55 inches but we still want to be able to shower so we got this guy so that and then we don't have the hook yet but there will be a hook soon and Greg is working on it so you can stand in shower but honestly I just sit in one of these when I eat it fast shower and then um I have to show you how comfortable or tub is because everyone's like is it comfortable it's really deep and it's not you can't like fully lay down in it but it kind of like cradles you and it's got a neck support so it's very comfortable I can take a bath right now here you can see we've got a petit Fleur that took me a very long time and my back still hurts there are 80 dollars worth of pennies in here and I silicone each one down individually and then I poured epoxy over it and it's my first time ever doing that but it turned out pretty good everyone seems to like the penny floor so it's actually Greg's idea and I fought it but it turned out really great I really like how it turned out and I did all the tile work in here we like the Chevron style you know I can see all of my mistakes but it turned out it turned out really well one of my other favorite features of our bathroom is the vanity I really wanted it to be unique again I just didn't want anything stock Home Depot so I got this really cool dragon faucet from I think I got it from England and this is actually a salad bowl from New York that I just loved the peacock color inside because we knew we were gonna do some turquoise in the brass and then you know we again we just wanted to do something unique so we came up with these just little different textures to add you'll see behind the toilet I have like a little mountain chevron pattern got plenty of storage or secret storage back here and one of the other things that I was talking about was the dirty laundry I really wanted somewhere to put that that wasn't like in the middle of the living room or in the middle of this like had to sit in the bathtub so I have a linen closet here my dirty laundry baskets not in it but it's normally there and then extra linen storage so got towels extra bedding I've got some of my toiletries my blow-dryer Greg's like razor but everything fits and it's all put away for the most part so I really I wanted to be able to hang out and have some privacy and feel like I could be a girl and not have to I don't know do this  [Music] so our lot which I was talking about you know with the the boat shape the loft is what gained the most space obviously it helps to the bathroom feeling a little bit larger but the loft is our storage loft everyone always asked what do you do with your loft and if the storage loft we could put a guest up there but and then the next question is how do you get up there well we went boring route and just got a telescoping ladder but since we really only get up there on the weekends or like maybe once or twice a week when Greg goes up there if I go to bed early we didn't really want a permanent ladder we wanted the space at our closet every inch matters so and then Greg Greg rigged it so that it could hook because it was kind of sketchy good beginning so yeah it just sucks up here we put these bars here so we could grab and get up and down safely and yeah up here in the loft you couldn't really see the wave of the roof so we do like to actually hang out up here but this is where our pole portholes are that we got from I think it was Galveston Texas they're all different sizes and they are all functioning and then the Rope people are like oh what's with the nautical theme we did rope to trim out the sides because we didn't want a curved wood and rope was easy so we did that but yeah we got a bunch of storage up here we got our cycling gear backpacks or like camping stuff you know I'll switch out the winter in the summer closed and store them up here cycling gear Greg likes to hunt so he's got his hunting rifles up here and then I've kind of got books settled a nook since we do hang out up here and Greg likes Maps so he'll sit up here and just pour over maps for like hours so this bed actually folds down and there's just a try folding mattress but a guest could you know could sleep on this pretty comfortably I actually use this when I go to like stay at friends houses and stuff we'll take this mattress with us you can see here Gregg's barnwood wall again we wanted to use all the scraps that we have around the shop you know we do like to use reclaimed things several of the things in our house are old and repurposed and then on either side here you know more books and just like my do my journal up here this is the very tip of the prow of the ship because we kind of joke about but this barn wood wall is the peak of the angle but it's very comfortable for lounging it kind of just cradles you back here it's very comfortable it's good spot this is like my favorite napping spot to be honest because I don't like leaving the bed down during the day like I think mostly because it's loud I think that's the only thing I don't really like about that but I will come up here and take a nap it's an excellent when it's raining you can hear on our pro panel roof it's a happy little nook this feeling when we were you know the curve was really hard to work with so we had this Aspen locally milled from Delores which is about an hour and a half from here and they they made it really thin so that we could bend it but every single board in here we had to cut like probably three times because every single one is different but when my favorite parts about up here is that when you're down there I don't really feel like you noticed the curve of the house but when you're up here you can really see how pretty it turned out and I think Greg being the architect that's part of what he likes to hang out up here so much every time it comes up he's like all our ceiling is so pretty so the Aspen turned out really nice and I love that it's local and then arm all of our lights not all of our lights I should rephrase that these barn lights are local old foreign lights as well and the ceiling fan which is actually a desk fan from like 1942 that Greg rewired to make into our ceiling fan so that's one of the cooler things as well again the repurposed [Music]  hey guys Alexis and Christian here with tiny-house expedition don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and click left or right for more tiny house stories and tours", "sFudJ2yIBJE": "this trick hasn't been used for a few years  apparently the digger was popped up when when these trees were just planted so you can see they've grown quite a bit  interesting to see what state it's in  that looks like an old Hitachi  you watch oh-for-three so that's one of the earlier ones that Itachi put out it's going back a few years  Jesus the withers been added a bit she's pretty well rusted out  no keys damn it very grass growing in it I've always got a cover for the exhaust so that's a good sign the engine hoses hopefully hasn't had water on it Rammstein let's do that there's a wee bit of rust there but those two front two are retracted so that's good there should be a right bloody cover covered in oil  looks like the hydraulic pump is still there good  it's actually pretty clean under there surprisingly looks to be all intact  doesn't look too bad all right everything seems to be intact so I think what odo has come up again tomorrow bring some batteries up maybe a bit of diesel and some tools and see if I can get it started it's probably gonna take a bit more than that but we'll see what we can do  it's been a rat's nest under there I suppose the first place to start as drawing get that key Barrow out of there and test the whys behind it to see if it's getting power there so I've tested or was was and it doesn't seem to be any power getting to the back of the keys I'll have to trace the wire back to the battery and see whether breakers I've traced the wiring back to this shutoff relay so this this here was lossless cable so I've tightened that up and now I'll see if is power getting to the key  of managed to get power to the ignition by attaching these buried a was but I can't seem to get the starter motor to engage so after do some more investigating  yes I found some Rhett Trude wiring up under there I've joined it again and I will see how that goes oh she's turning over that's a relief before I go any further I'll change the world and fill up the radiator that's a good sign she's turning over it's not seized up so I do a bit of maintenance on the motor and then we'll try again  yeah the radiator had water or not so I only had to put about three liters on so that's a good sign it's not leaking out of the radiator anywhere it's probably just evaporated over the years still had some oil in it but probably only about three or four liters that's it's got a slow leak and it's mostly drained out over the years yes blackest tar that stuff so I put some fresh oil in it now it's holding oil that's good it took all of that ten liters just the right amount the next job is to flush the diesel tank see if I can get fuel to the fuel pump diesel tankers up there so I've got to somehow reach up there drain what's in it and refill it with fresh fuel hey that's not lift in that diesel tank and it doesn't really look like fuel anymore there's a bit of rust on this yeah that wasn't gonna start quite a bit of water as well by the looks of it  I ran out of power on the batteries yesterday before I could do any more I had a go at starting at priming the pump it was turning over but not firing so I replaced the fuel filter you can see it's got quite a bit of rust and in there so it's got a new filter in there I'll give another Prime and then see if it'll start  okay I'm theory now it should start stopped fresh fuel new oil water the engines turning over so and this is a problem with the both compression or the fuel pump it should run but before I try and start it again I'll check the hydraulic oil so I don't want to doing the pump out if it has all week tout  as you can see the hydraulic O'War looks pretty good after all these years I see a bit of moisture on the cap so I'll drain a few liters off the bottom that'll let all the water out of the tank don't really want water going through the pump  well she's a runner most of the controls work boom the arm and the bucket controls will work but of a leak on that RAM it doesn't look too bad bad results that only one of the travel motors works the side one is all right that one's got no engagement whatsoever this the control stick actually feels quite loose like there's something disconnected so I'll have a look underneath that'll be the problem that linkages come off so obviously a nut that's come off there it was holding it on I've managed to find a temporary fix for it so I just put a bit of tape around the thread so it doesn't ruin it and put a pair of vise grips on there so that that'll hold it in place just temporarily opening another nut up for it tomorrow so see if that works  I went to start it this morning and it wouldn't go so I had a bit of a look under here and I noticed the feed pipe this rubber pipe here had perished yeah right at the where it goes onto the the hand pump so I've pulled it off cut it and put it back on so the parish but that's gone now and reprime knit and it's good again that and I should get it going again yeah it had leaked a bit of fuel but just mainly got a bit of air into the fuel system so that's what wasn't starting obviously these trees weren't here when it was parked up so I went quite foot through there so what I'll have to do is try and work my way up slowly and scrape a bit out of the bank there so I can get through it's gonna be a long day probably getting it out I also checked all the oil and the swing motor the gearbox oil in there and the travel motor gearbox hauls and one of them looks good but the other one seems to have hydraulic fluid on it it's leaking through the main seal of the travel motor they don't need pulling apart and fixing before I do too much work but it should hopefully get me out of here to a place where I can pull it you know strip it down take it out  [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]  [Music]  mission complete I managed to crawl with digger home to my place took two days but we got there in the end had a bit of a nursery with this travel might have started passing out oil so I poked and prodded and this this whole pipe broke off so so rust and through it just and just popped off a whole lot of hydraulic fluid came back through it's just the case drain pipe so not a huge deal but I'm going to take it off here and just swirled it back on so they've got me home anyway this this is the motor I'm gonna have to pull apart because it's leaking from I dropped motor through to the gearbox so there's obviously some seals or something go on in there looks like it's quite rusty so I might end up having to buy another one if it's too shared and soon to be tracking all right maybe a bit less power than the other side but I think these ones are quite prone to leaking through from the motor to the planetary side yeah that's the gearbox side and it should only be about that full with oil but that's full with hydraulic fluid so it means the fluids from the hydraulic motor is coming straight through seals so if it's been doing it for a long time it's probably worn some grooves in the shaft and I might have to get it reground anyway small price to pay for a free digger another thing I noticed was the tracks are obviously pretty worn out you know and there's odd loose squirrels over there but that the tracks are quite quite sloppy so eventually have to replace those and this top roller the bearings are shot and that's just spinning around craft so I have to replace that but apart from that she's pretty good mix a bit of oil but nothing too major got to expect that for a 40-year old digger the arm Ram the seal was shot on that and these ones have a slow leak so I've got three Rams to reseal I should be able to fix it for a listen maybe was that motor maybe less than $3,000 hopefully so cheap digger really and the neighbors happy that it's gone from this property so everybody's happy", "5rYPRMm8Arw": "I've been asked how I am finding water when I dig a well it's pretty simple what I use many people disagree with it say it doesn't work I'm not here to change anybody's mind I'm just telling you what I use and what works for me and again this is only for shallow wells something both let's say no deeper than 30 feet and my secret weapon is coat hangers dowsing rods and what I use to make these work correctly so I don't have to wonder from my thumb or fingers are helping or that it's rotating correctly drinking straws take a drinking straw cut it in half slide it over in slide it over and I don't let my thumbs touch I don't grab tight and hold it don't let my fingers rub on this you want it just to come up and they're very easy to rotate within these straws you want to keep them  perpendicular to the ground or just up pointed down just slightly because you don't want to work against and I'll go out as I'm about to do another well out where my I have some bees and I need to make sure that they're having plenty of water and it's further that I want to tote it every day and I'll have a further demonstration once we get out there  I've marked that spot  okay what's happening here is real interesting it happens every once in a while I'm getting hit on a line which means to me which has been my experience there is an underwater stream right here  it might make more sense if I come in this way again it's kind of comfortable perpendicular to the ground just a little bit lower walk up they start to cross now just kind of like put a foot marker right here which means I could dig anywhere on this line and I'm gonna hit water because there's a stream of sorts running underneath here the other thing that will happen occasionally is  instead of them crossing we get a little closer instead of them crossing like this you may go pass something and both of them go like this or like this in me is I need to go that direction back towards where the water is and once I start going that way they will cross again a lot of times this will point you in the direction that you need to go now sometimes it I've done this where I can't find anything I mean I'm not getting any hit this just so happens it has bit this has been about the easiest I did I started and as soon as it I started getting hits on the water and I bet if I start going across like this probably about three or four more feet it's going across there direct line so since I have been fortunate enough to find what I believe to be blowing water underneath here I'm going to try to find a spot that's convenient for me  particularly point sand that's the way it is been for the whales that i did\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00b4t another part of the property so what convenient for me this area because I can keep it out of the way and it's convenient so let's see what back we'll come back up on that line  okay scuff in the ground back here  I get another line I'm just gonna pick me a spot I'll pick me a spot this could be on this line now that we got everything ready start on our wheel  [Music]  okay thanks to pay attention to as you're digging as I started it's very sandy here of course as you see but I got down to a little over five feet in the sand it's changing color SEC I mean I'm getting to a different kind of sand I'm getting to clay whatever but when you're digging pay attention to the changes in the color of what you're digging because that can give you clues as to what you're about to get into weather getting closer to water whether you dig somewhere else around on your property you may have an idea of what to expect and the difference between the original auger with having to use a pipe wrench and everything to take stuff up with this method right here making these extensions out of square bar tubing just move sprinkly up they handle off  but extension here reattach spring clip  put your handle back on  but just friend clip in and you're ready to keep rolling  so we're down a little over 10 feet now it's starting to get into the clay and usually you get there you get to the other side of it and in that sand on the other side of the clay or Rock that's where you get to start getting water so I anticipate anytime  this thing's starting to get a little bit wet  it's also important that you try to keep things straight up and down perpendicular you starkey crooked you're gonna have problems putting your pipe in later on  what we're done about now 13 feet we've started to hit water not late it's really really wet with really rough sand mixed with it squeeze it out here's a tip especially if you're working by yourself because this can get 50 dog Oh heavy get to the point we help control this thing if you've made one of these with the detachable pieces the square tubing just take the handle off it doesn't seem like that weighs a lot but you don't have to balance it up in there and it makes it a whole lot easier  and you don't have to worry about hitting you ball head on the way down  there you go when you get in the water there's gonna be a lot of suction and it is not gonna want to let you pull this up so to help get it started you need to do is you need to twist and pull at the same time to break that suction loose and that's a little harder to do when you're trying to pull the handle off so you'll just have to work out it's all by feel you'll feel it let go like I said right now I'm pulling up on it and twisting and it is not letting go  okay there we go knows a part of the joys of working place okay we're finished not that you can see anything down in there there's our varying bits of soul I wanted to go deeper I'm about eighteen feet which is not very deep but I got four feet of water in the hole but here's the reason I went ahead and stopped and this is from experience this right here there's green clay this is out of focus clay and you get in this and it goes on for a while and it is tough and it is slimy and it is a lot of work and I'm not gonna gain anything by killing myself going any further I just need to be able to get a little water out of this thing to take care of my bees and water a plant or two around here with old cistern pump so oh one more thing  this is why you pay attention when you dig it's broken right off in here that's oh it's an old spearhead that came up find lots of arrowheads and spearheads around here this is one he came up about I don't know I was about four or five feet down and got it well next we're gonna put our pipe in the hole okay here's our PVC casing pipe that's gonna go on the ground it's about 20 feet long because I got about a four foot water table in the hole I just come up from the bottom a little bit get this in you'll get our pea gravel around it and we'll pack dirt back around it and our casing pipe will be finished under then capping it off and then we will put our pump pipe in okay so we just about ready now what I like to do when I fill the hole back in of course first put the pipe in then I put the pea gravel in to be higher than the level of the notches I cut in the the four inch PVC then I start replacing the soil that came out of the ground and what I do is I start from this and me from what came out last and work my way up to what came out first as you can see I haven't got half way through and I'm already full you know also like this one here sometimes I do it beforehand I will clean around the bottom of the the hole where I'm digging this one here was a lot of nice grass and I just left it there now I'm through digging the hole and I'm filling in I go in and I've chopped all the the grass around it I'll pack this here down and then we're going to cap it with concrete a bag or two of sack Creek should be fine and what that does that causes the water not to be able to run down into your well it will run around it it's just another way to seal it off we get that done and hopefully tomorrow we will be able to get the get our other pipe in and go ahead and put the pump on  once it gets close to the Bob you'll feel it once the slack goes out of it you've hit the bottom there's mine I'm at the bottom so what I like to do is take it and tie myself a little knot right there so I know where the top of my case is let's bring it back up  right about there so  I've got almost four feet almost four feet of water in there so what I need to do is measure this cord from the end of the top and be about one foot shorter because we don't want the bottom of our whale pipe to be touching the bottom of our case and being say it I've already cut my pipe these shallow wheels this is one of the most important things that you can have to save you all kinds of trouble this is a foot bowel and what it does is it allows water to come into your pipe and it will not come back out so your pump will always stay Prime so then the next thing we need to do is lower this down in our whale  and I'm using one-inch pipe on this piece together this is a scrap whale  okay what I don't want to do lose this  you know I can grab it  the other thing I've done is like went and got a flat a four inch flange for a drain or a toilet it's gonna be easy to sit to stay in there and then just kind of forward to set on top nice let that thing sit right in there down nice and tight okay it does not get any easier than that right there so as far as your well being you're done with with this part you don't have to worry about stabilizing or anything then your pitcher pub one thing would be easier to do is it go ahead and prime it go ahead and get water in that pipe so you're not fighting to bring it up water down in our pie  I'm hoping that's enough water I may not have got enough but then we'll take our picture pop attached to the top of our pie  we'll see we got enough in their prime  and we don't I might get some more water to help this thing get prize okay we had to get some more water because I have enough to private thing but we I look at this as a good training example not to freak out if it doesn't work there's not water and you can prime right through your pitcher club to just open it up and pour through  you're gonna have to pump and pump and pump until you get rid of all that because that's all the stuff to spend disturbed at the bottom it will take a while eventually it will clear now what I do  so I have to worry about this thing moving I'm just going to attach it to my block up here  it's good to go and if you notice the being started I already I put my concrete at the bottom and the reason for that is twofold one you want to keep your whale clean you don't want brown rock water running in it bring your contaminants in but to think about this way you have opened a hole in the ground exposing water down there you want to be a good steward and not let stuff get nasty so you're you're not only keeping your well water clean but you're keeping water clean and other people may end up using so now we'll just let this thing sit get it cleaned up in my job is to pump this thing get it cleaned out and we've got another wheel okay we're gonna wrap all this up we've got it installed we got it aground we're getting water I still need to clear mine but we're not going to do that here I just want to close this up with a few tips to help you in some problems that may come up with all this that seemed to come up with all of them one make sure all of your connections your your PVC glued connections your teflon tape connections all those are tight if not they will leak a little bit you'll loose Prime and you'll have problem with your pump too if your pump after doing it this way and having the foot valve on the bottom if it continues to loose prime probably what's happened is the dirt or sand or whatever that's in the bottom of the Year whale has gotten into the foot valve and it's keeping it from closing all the way which is allowing water to run back out it's not a big deal pull this off pull your pipe out take that foot valve apart there's one screw it takes out you can clean it out get the sanded junk out put it back together drop it back in it should be fine  finally keep a bucket or a container of water near your pump until it is given you continual water it can be quick prime of this thing where you can continue going and eventually hopefully you'll have one that you don't have to worry about I've got one of those around here it stays primed all the time so good luck what you dig in hope this helps um and I'm gonna get out of here because it's starting to rain happy digging", "NiARHO2d3Rs": "hey guys I gotta tell you I think I have got one of the best logs that I have ever cut on my wood-mizer here with me today this is a figured maple that I had a customer bring me and again they had a difficult time finding someone that was willing to do this log I'd cut some other things for them before and it was one that I asked them if they would please bring it here to me at my home so that I can saw it here and have a little bit more time and more tools and things available at my resources to move it around this thing is gigantic and so as they brought it to me I understood that I was going to have to do a little bit of chainsaw work to it to get this whole thing able to work out and I'm gonna walk here on the log here a little bit and show you just why this is kind of challenging but also at the same time what we want to use as much of our capabilities as possible to cut this thing because there's tremendous value in this figured maple log that they brought me let's take a look at it right now as we approach this log this figured maple you can see all these kind of Burling and figure around the outside of the log and it is absolutely everywhere all the way around it and then when we get to this side you'll see where the customer started cutting it down on the side there and even at that when we look up close you can see oh my gosh look at all of the figure that is in that so this is going to be quite a fun project to do back it up a little bit here and you can see kind of how that was cut now the challenge is a Sawyer when we look at something like this is that first of all it is too big for my mill as it currently is the wood-mizer lt40 that I run can handle a log that is up to thirty six inch diameter that's a bit early around  it's not rounded as curvature to it and other issues that would affect the ability you saw this properly so what I have to do is I have to go ahead and get out the chainsaw and do a little bit of work clean up where they started cutting and cut that off and I might take that and turn that into some bowls or something because it's not going to be really useful for lumber but I think that we're gonna have a good time today cutting this up so let's get started [Music] as you can see now that I've cut that it is certainly a lot straighter I've gotten rid of that bump on the bottom as we walk around here you can see the color difference from the old to the new from what I've cut there so I'm gonna go fire up the skid steer and tip this thing over I'm going to try to set it on the mill and it's going to take a bit of craft to cut this one down let's see what happens  [Applause]  [Applause] [Music]  [Applause]  now that I have this awesome maple log up on the mill I have to go about starting to cut it so this is now approximately chainsaw down to the maximum diameter that this mill can handle you're gonna see that I'm gonna have to still rotate it and take cuts around the outside just to get it to a reasonable working size and they're still chainsaw marks from the other side from where the customer had cut it across before so there's a little bit to work around but we have a lotta log to work with here so there's going to be a little bit of scrap but there is I think we're gonna have some very beautiful wood in this [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music] well guys I got to be honest I thought after I did don't tell my wife how I did this video and it went crazy with I think we're almost at 2 million or over 2 million views now but I would kind of be done doing stuff like this um little wood dust in my mouth but this is the kind of thing those videos have a lot of power in the fact that they bring me work I get to do that other people would never get to do and have a lot of fun doing it so let's continue cutting this log [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Laughter] [Music]  [Music]  [Music] I want to share something with you guys about cutting a log like this a little bit of insider information some of you watch this video because your Sawyer's yourself and you like to see different techniques and you like to see how other people do things some of you are new to saw milling and you want to know if certain things are possible if you can really do them ya with enough motivation you can do just about anything and with enough time and enough chainsaw chains and gas and lubricant you can pull off just about any job jobs like this are difficult and one of the reasons is because of all the work you got to put into them but there's always a point in time when I know I finally got the job licked and that's when I'm reaching this point that I'm about at now you eventually reach a point where you've got it straight enough and you've made enough cuts around that now you know from here on out there's probably not going to be any more chainsaw work there's probably not going to be any more funny rotating the log around or anything like that and I think that I'm just about there now so let's go let's finish it out  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  okay if you can see here on this last cut I hit a nail right there and shiny thing right there and that nail will dull blade so I need to change the blade out right now to finish cutting this log  all right so this log is officially a pain in the rear now I thought I had hit a nail but it was very robust whatever I hit and I'm trying to dig this out of here now to see if we can figure out exactly what it was it is stuck in here but whatever it is it's very substantial so I'm gonna go get another tool to try to pry this out and cut it out of here all right this is the picture of what it is here you can see that is a thick metal strap that is embedded into this log I have no idea how far it goes through all right well I'm gonna keep going on this let's see where I get all right after digging in this for a little bit longer I discovered that this metal strap has a twin there's one right there and there's the other one so I'm gonna have to make an executive decision here I realized that this is really too far into this log to be able to cut this and have any success without going through every blade that I have and so the decision that I'm making now is that I'm going to cut this log right about here cut down with the chainsaw in the hopes that those straps are going that direction and then I can cut the rest of this into short stock which should be just fine for whatever purposes that we have in mind for it well guys this log is what we call a butt kicker there's nothing else that I can say about it that metal strap in there is going somewhere I cut it where I thought would be a safe distance away from that strap and I got about four inches into it and I obviously hit metal so now my chain on my chain saw is ruined so the next thing to do is to try to cut even higher yet - probably like about another six inches above that and see if that metal strap is continuing to go up there I have other commitments today so I got to come back to this for you watching it will make a difference but for me I got to come back to this that's supposed to rain all day tomorrow and I work outside cover of the mill up at night and so it's gonna be a couple days until I can even get back to this so then I'm gonna have to resume recording for you all when I get all my stuff together and be able to do this so we're two sawmill blades in hopefully the third one I put in is the last and I'm just saying this is what you get into when you get into some of these large logs that come from a person's house or neighborhood you will cut into it relatively speaking you'll cut ten or fifteen years into that log and then you'll find something that someone nailed or strapped in there from I don't know 40 years ago and there you go so we'll come back to this and you'll see me in a second which will be a couple days take care guys okay I felt inclined to say one more thing before I come back in a second to finish up this log don't give up sometimes things are just difficult and there's a lot of life lessons to be learned and this is one of those don't I don't get this hardened when this stuff happens it doesn't bother me it used to but it doesn't bother me anymore because there are serious lessons learned in something like this and so much better than this victimization ideology that seems to exist today where everybody thinks they've had a hard life but have really overcome nothing except for maybe the sofa in their parents basement this here is stuff that grows life in commission and it grows good character and so these are the kind of things that I want to raise my kids in maybe not sawmilling but I want them to know that when things happen you don't blow up and you don't get irritated but you fix the problem and you move on so there you go there's the moral of this whole story let's finish this log  [Music]  [Music] okay guys it's time to show you why this wood was worth saving this is something I know that you all want to see look at that you can see guys all the figure that's in this wood is just absolutely crazy now I got another big piece that I want to show you here real quick here's another couple pieces  [Music]  here's some close-up shots look at that just absolutely stunning hopefully you can see that  one thing the sawmilling business has taught me is about never giving up every now and then I'll get some young guys that are working with me and we'll ask them the question about halfway through the day when they start thinking like oh my gosh this is really tough and moving these heavy boards is awful and I'll ask them this one question I'll say son what do you think sawmilling is about and has usual I get kind of a dull look in the eyes and I say sawmilling is about winning every time that you approach something you're going to run into difficulty you know I think that work is about teaching life lessons as well it's not just about monotonous labor that goes on and on and is this mind numbing thing that you never get any enjoyment out of work should be enjoyable and it should be a challenge and you should have a lot of joy in overcoming those challenges and so that's part of what I've learned about doing this business it's just finding joy in what you do yeah it can be difficult work at times but it's worth it and so that's why I've kept doing this over the years this maple log was absolutely beautiful and it's a shining example of why it's worth putting in the extra effort sometimes to get something that's really worthwhile guys I hope that you've enjoyed watching this video if you like what you're seeing here please go ahead and

our land looked like this you  three years later and a lot of hard work our land now looks like this  [Music] this all started after myself and my wife bought a 42 acre piece of land that had been for sale for quite some time  [Music] it was heavily treated with invasive maple trees that had not been thinned or maintained ever  [Music]  while these trees were invasive we didn't want to remove all of them but we did want to remove enough to have a usable piece of land [Music]  after hand drawing the plans for a fairly simple house we got our permit to build and the work began  initially the house was going to be right around 1,600 square feet with a few bedrooms upstairs in one great room downstairs we are good to go  initially the plan was to subcontract out the things we weren't comfortable doing do the things we were comfortable doing try to save money in between and wrap it up in a 30-year mortgage because our land is 2.6 miles from the nearest powerline nobody wanted to finance the project  this caused us to do some serious reflection and reevaluate just in fact what we could and couldn't do  I have 15 years in the plumbing trade but above and beyond that I had zero other construction experience good help has been hard to find [Music] we started with the septic system got a little bit of help from a few friends to pour the foundation and from that point on basically did everything ourselves  up to this point I had very little framing experience I had framed up maybe a shed and a little bit of interior work in a remodel but that was it  I did what I knew how to do I talked to the right people when I didn't know what to do [Music]  I looked for discounts where I could get them paid cash as we went  [Music] conventionally framed the entire house and did virtually everything myself  [Music]  along the way we battled every kind of weather you can think of [Music] along the way I've lost a few things mainly a few pounds but I found something that has given me more purpose in life than almost anything else  [Music]  when the cost to build an average home in the area is north of a hundred and fifty dollars a square foot we've managed to keep our costs around $16 a square foot  [Music]  after getting the lower portion of the land thinned and cleared and as we began to understand just in fact the beauty that we had we felt that the rustic doug-fir siding would be perfect up here  [Music]  my trusty sidekick Ruger has never let me down regardless of the conditions [Music] because the bank told us no it forced me to figure out ways to save money which ultimately meant that I was going to do everything from the septic system to the gas line to the electrical to the roofing to the siding to the solar system everything that will be necessary to give us the 21st century comforts that we're looking for  I had never done anything significant with electrical but I had a couple of good friends that were willing to talk me through it as I had questions our only source of heat is a wood-burning stove in the last three years that we've owned the land we've had as much as four feet of snow  we framed the house to handle well over a hundred pound snow load  as we got deeper into construction we realized that we needed more room our intentions are to keep everything associated with a solar system inside the house we've had more challenges along the way than I could have ever imagined  there have been moments where I wondered if this would ever come to an end  there have been moments where I figured out why nobody had ever built a house up here in the first place the end result is we're three years into this in the house is nearly finished  we have nearly a 2,000 square foot house that's very well built that we love it's paid for [Music]  we poured another 400 square feet of concrete which gave us a utility room for the water heater and everything associated with the solar system as well as another bedroom in the bathroom we've had just as many ups as we've had downs along the way but we're in the homestretch  [Music] we're moments away from moving in  while we have many other projects like a root cellar like building my shop like building a cabin on the back section of our property we first can't wait to just move in I then dug a shallow well ran over a thousand feet of waterline to a water tank that's over a hundred feet above the house  [Music]  after hauling the water tank up the hill and getting it properly positioned getting the solar well pumps in place we have water  [Music] there's no question that hindsight is always 20/20 [Music]  knowing what I know now if I could go back to the beginning and start over I most definitely would have done things different  [Music] I most definitely would have avoided some of the mistakes I've made and some of the changes that we've had to embrace but what's the point if this was easy everybody would be doing it sometimes it's hard to know what we're capable of until we're put in situations where we just have to get things done [Music]  I've made mistakes I will make more mistakes I promise but anything worth doing is gonna be hard this is probably the hardest thing I've ever done in my life [Music]  second only to being a husband and a father it's definitely one of the most rewarding things I've ever done we've got a lot more projects to come and I've got a lot more learning to do [Music] my shop foundation walls have been waiting for me for two years that's also on the short list [Music] the upstairs is nearly finished with drywall I'm about to transition to the downstairs drywall then it's paint kitchen cabinets then we'll probably move in we've saved more money along the way than I ever could have imagined we are nearly finished with our mortgage free home living in one of the most beautiful spots on the planet as hard as this has been we wouldn't change it for the world we have individual playlists of every phase of construction that we've gone through nearly 300 videos  [Music] don't forget to subscribe to see what the next three years look like you", "A5pIy4F6-WE": "", "ionts0scA6I": "I'm here at the Colorado band life gathering and I have found a really beautiful build out that I want to show you so let's go check it out [Music] [Applause]  hey guys I'm Kristin my lovely home where the road forks on Instagram me and my two pups we travel a full time in our Ford Transit 250 medium 148 wheelbase yes - come on in this detail right here is one of my favorite things my best friend drew this for me and there's us in the center there and she wrote me the sweetest letter about how home is where the heart is and so she was so happy for me that I will always have my home with my heart and so she'd do that so one of my favorite accents are these hooks no these are the light switches Oh so these turn on different lights and I can control them from here and in the back so in case I'm too lazy to walk three feet up to the front one of my favorite features here in the van is the sliding door this is just so huge for one reason or three reasons really I have a full-length mirror which is amazing to be able to get myself you know um it slides open and then it locks into place with this little key just locks in for when I'm driving um but if you're standing here right now you could feel the heat wave coming in and so it just keeps the heat out which is huge when I have dogs that's so important and so I absolutely love that also from the front if you were to look at it it looks just like a contractor's man it's just a grey wall so that kind of adds a little bit more stealth to it helps me stay a little safer also if someone were to break in in the front it gives me a few moments to react if I need to love my open shelves concept here I mean that's not very organized but I love being able to just like pull out whatever I need moment and I'll have to dig around for it here I just have a regular dorm room fridge and freezer it works great for me I know a lot of people are conflicted on it but I really like it it helps me kind of feel more homely then that Dometic in the salon I really like that my induction stove just pops it out puts on top I didn't want to put it built-in on the countertop because I wanted all this open space to cook cut veggies whatever and just more storage for utensils we have this locking mechanism so it they won't come out while I'm driving so they kinda have to push them into place on this side is where I have my electric oven so my whole solar system is built around this oven so it does these I'm very easy okay so it slides out and  then I have to pick it up and put it out on top so I can bake and it's actually an artificial intelligent oven so if I put like chocolate chip cookie dough inside it will actually ask me if I'm cook baking chocolate chip so it has a camera inside so I can do like time-lapse videos on the beam it's a really cool oven I really love it so it's not just like a convection oven it truly is a full oven under here is just storage but I also have my toilet so not probably the most sanitary two ways to combine things but it's got the shelf mm-hmm you do what you can in the van this side is just you know cleaning supplies water my tanks are here my 12-volt water pump isn't right in here as well the farmhouse sink it's beautiful thank you I work for a faucet company I work for a Delta Faucet company so it's kind of how I was able to get such a lovely faucet got that employee discount but it has three features like regular spray and then bubble oh yeah kind of cool here we have this shower so I originally did it for the dog so I could shower them off after hike but it works for me as well so I love that feature and have these outdoor leashes for the dogs that way while I'm working you know or cooking or whatever they can be outside and I don't have to worry about them running off or anything like that my water supply is here just fill that up it holds 21 gallons of fresh water and 15 gallons of greywater this is in case I want to work outside I have the option this outdoor table that slides out also I like baking cake so I can like decorate the cakes here if I wanted to and it pops up and I have some storage inside it's not very well organized yet but it works for now here I have my lagoon table and it swivels around I'm sure you've seen it before I love it it also adds if I swivel it this way I have all this countertop space to like cook wet and it's just it's awesome I love having it speaking of countertop space something I did not show you was here to the side so I can have even more as you can tell they love baking cooking so countertop space with super important not just locks in place on this side is electrical and bedding and shoes and I'm just pods and ends things so I just move these hidden goodies right there so here we have my beddings on this side just a few things um kind of hard to show my electrical stuff because this is actually a box that pulls out and everything is underneath so I have a 3000 watt inverter here I have two massive batteries underneath pretty hair the solar converter as you can see like the bench mode is good but it is a lot of hassle to get into things mm-hmm so it's a love-hate relationship here I have kind of what I consider my closet but this this is where my water tanks go to mm-hmm and then I use my base packing cubes for everything and I have some vacuum sealed bags in here for the bulkier clothes truthfully I probably have way too many clothes but I've only been in the van five weeks so I figured by the end of the year I agree evaluate and get rid of what I don't mean so the way that the bed works when I want to put it into bed mode is here I have these slats and they pull out and they actually lock into place here so I have them on both of these and then I'm just gonna pop this down mm-hmm so you have to take your table mount so this would be removed and then what happens is these cushions come into the center right and it creates a queen-size bed suite oh yeah I do have a full queen-size bed so it's really nice the table sometimes is annoying to set it up and down so I would say say I mostly stay in bed mode I really like being in the bed mode and the dogs when I'm traveling driving they prefer being in the bed as well so yes this is our homestay home nice I love it it is so beautiful and so tell us about your build like the process um so I want the company called next garage they are in Indianapolis and I just I don't have the skills I wanted it to feel as homely as possible and I've always been inspired by Joanna Gaines so um like Magnolia farms and all that so it kind of was inspired by the dark wood and I wanted to bring the outside in almost so that's where the green backsplash of the tile even to the green kettle pot I just really wanted the greenery needs to be brought into my home so I also have this skylight which since I didn't have side windows I could have added them but I decided I want to be able to look up at the stars at night and I felt like it would give me more privacy on the sides that way I could still enjoy the sunlight from the top and I just I loved it so much it can actually be like right here these unclip and it I can remove the glass all the way and so I can stand through it um yeah so it really helps me bring the outside in especially at night and I love that nice and so do you build your bed do you ever sleep on just part of it or do you build the whole things yeah so if I'm being extra lazy sometimes I will just move that to one side and sleep on on one side mm-hmm especially if it's like when I'm just tired yeah so I mean it is enough it's smaller than a twin sized bed but it fits me I sleep pretty tight anyways mm-hmm it sleeps me just fine and the dogs sleep on the other side what made you decide to do been like am I such a loaded question I mean I think similar to everyone that has stuck in the nine-to-five world the corporate lifestyle and I just wanted something different and I always wanted to travel internationally full-time and live out of like hostels in a backpack but I had two dogs and I believe that when you get a dog you get them for life there's no giving it back it's a lifetime commitment I believe so I was thinking how can i how can I combine my backpack lifestyle with my dogs and that's where van life came came into play it's kind of my big backpack if you will and I was blessed that my job I gave them a proposal about letting me work remote and they said yes so I had just go back to part-time but that's all right so I'm working part-time fully on the road and it really has been such a blessing to be able to do what I love all the time awesome yeah share your social again where the road forks nice and that's Instagram yeah okay excellent thank you so much for showing us your beautiful home Oh glad you guys could see it thanks for joining us this is Joni with the Gallivan enjoy your journey [Music]", "h9hOn5_AzyA": "", "ZSHBmS_GG7o": "hey guys how you doing we're down in

the lumberyard and they drop off a pile of sticks like this the problem with traditional framing though is everywhere you've got a stud you've got a huge inefficiency in your wall you've got a huge thermal bridge in your wall on the build show today I'm gonna show you a brand new type of framing you have never seen before today's video is sponsored by T stud let's get going  okay so first let's look at traditional lumber standard 2x6 right here what's the problem with that I've build a lot of houses out of two-by-six very strong but the problem is about 25% of our house ends up being wood and wood is not particularly good at insulating you'd never build your cooler out of wood would you this is roughly our six point eight whereas the cavity in between our 16 inch studs we're gonna put let's say in our nineteen bat in there so compared to the center this stud is very very inefficient now in today's video we're about to take a tour of this house that's been framed with this brand new product that I have never seen before this is called the T stud and this is what it looks like in the naked version what you're looking at basically is a truss you've got a 2 by 3 on both sides and it's connected structurally with dowels and then what they do is at the factory they actually use closed-cell spray foam in between there so remember that 2 by 6 that was an AR six point eight this isn't our twenty can you imagine that this is as good as that cavity without our 19 bat so now we have no need for exterior insulation that big blanket that I talked about putting on all those houses because the studs themselves are not conducting the heat through our 20 that's pretty cool all right without further ado let's go out in the house and actually show you what it looks like on a whole house framed with the T stud okay let's start here guys this is an uncomplicated part of the house we're in the bonus room above the garage and this I think is going to give you the basics on what the T stud is all about so first off they've run these on 24 inch on center marks and you can see this is that T stud this is actually five-and-a-half inches deep so the same depth as a standard two by six and then here on the front though this is where it differs we're actually two and a half inches wide on the flange so in effect it's a two by three with another two by three and then those dowel rods and you can see here they come to the jobsite in a pallet already foamed in the center but if you look at this from a wide angle you can see what I really like about the system we've got a single bottom plate right here you've got studs and 24 inch centers and then you also have a single top plate on here with the T stud as well because that T stud is a truss you've got a lot more strength and we're gonna talk to the inventor in a minute will tell us the specifics but I love how if you look at this exterior wall right here you basically have that foam that's in the center all the way down the wall and that's how they are able to get these into an AR 20 so now when we put our 19 bats in let's say on this 2 by 6 you actually have more insulation value at your studs than in your cavity which is totally different now the electrician's have just started on this house and there's also a couple of interesting things when it comes to electrical the electrician's actually just going to poke through here because there is a void and you can do that with a screwdriver and then always gonna do is stab his wire through no drill necessary now in this case we've got framing below us so they're fastening with these screws right here because we've got that two and a half inch wide bottom plate you can't use just a standard 16 penny nail you actually need at least an inch pin Edmund so you'll see they've staggered these screws and they've screwed them down now in other parts of the house where we're on concrete slab on grade they're gonna have a Jay bolt that's gonna come up in the center of this foam here and then they've got a big wide plate that's going to go on top of that so that that Jay bolt will transfer its hold down power to this bottom or pardon me to the kind of top and bottom cord so to speak on this t stud and then wear walls come together it looks like the framers framed this wall here separate from this wall that they put a strap you're gonna see that on typical standard top plate or single top plate type framed advanced framed houses and that's what they've done here they put a strap there they've also done that in this corner here where they've strapped the corner together and they frame this with it what we call a California corner so this wood right here is just gonna hold drywall up and they've done a good job of holding that back a little bit inside the corner so that insulation can go all the way back through man what a totally wild totally different system that I'm used to seeing okay this is something interesting too they've used it for headers let's look at this one first so we've got a looks like an eight-foot patio door right here no bigger than that it's actually a nine-foot patio door now we're on a gable end right here so we don't have a lot of load but look what they've used they've used tee studs for the headers as well so in effect you've got an insulated header they've run these that horizontal single top plate all the way down and then they've got three tee studs acting as a header same with these windows over here if you look at these windows over here they've got a single tee stud in the center which again is insulated that's that are 20 stud and then they basically just pack the cavity the framers said that it was actually easier to do it this way than it was to put a bunch of small cripples in there so again you've got that continuous top plate all the way across there and then here they've got their king stud and their jack stud and those two right there are helping with load as well and then these two studs that are in here they're basically just drywall nailers they're just holding it but again because it's an AR 20 they're providing insulation so now you've got an insulated structural header you can basically eliminate all of your normal lumber that you might use for headers so your LS LS your lvls all those things that we might have to build in the field and a sandwich capacity with some insulation in between you can eliminate that and you do that with the t stub pretty cool wasn't what a unique system simple yet something I've never seen before pretty wild let's go grab Jesse the Builder and see what he thinks about these hey guys I'm here with the Builder of this house Jesse Jesse thanks for having me on your job man my pleasure is this your first time using t stud oh this is not this is probably our 15th time using T studs we've been solid T studs for a little over two years now dang did you tell me earlier that your own house was the T stud house that you built that's correct about to a little over two years ago my own personal house was the first t-star house built how the first he's not house so two years later what's it been like you know as a builder the biggest difference I've noticed and come to appreciate is the fact that we've got in this freeze-thaw cycle we've got up here Minnesota yeah you tend to get your builder callbacks on your nail pops your sheetrock settling and things like that and we've seen a drastic reduction in any of those gonna call that there's one year marker when you're normally going back to fix that stuff a lot less because of this what do you attribute to that do you think for us I think it's it's got to be the stability of the t stud and the thermal break in their traditional wood studs are in this climate you know you're building in the rain you're building the snow of those things just tend to dry out and they can buckle on you so for us we've just seen a lot of stability with these studs Jessie would your framer think about this either the first time or now 15 houses later yeah well we've got a couple different framing crews and like anything in this industry guys move a little slower and so the first time they saw this there was definitely some swear words but by the second or third house they were jumping at the bit to get to another T stud house and they've really come to appreciate the the differences in the framing the lightness of the walls and so they're actually able to speed frame ax T stud houses a little bit quicker than they can do a traditional house because of the less weight that's kind of cool less wood framing two feet on center versus 16 on center single top plate so yeah they can stand up longer walls with less guys I hadn't thought about that you got a single top plate to sue now that walls a little lighter because you've got a little less weight overall two foot centers single top plate that's cool now tell me about Calvo you know when we get a typical SPF framing package let's say there's at least you know 5% of those thuds that go back to the lumberyard or in the trash or coming from blocking what's your what's your waste factor on these with the T studs you know we're probably looking at less than 1% rarely do we send one back and if we do get a little bit of twist in there then we just end up it either using it for a cripple onto our window or something like that so okay so very little waste that's cool hey guys I'm here with the inventor of the teesta Brian Iverson now Brannon know people watching this video at this point are thinking can this really replace a 2 by 6 for its structural value what would you say to that I can tell you that it's we're actually four times a 2x6 no matter if they're made out of lvl or LSL all feel they call this the x-axis they all fail in the x-axis because they Bend out a deflection if you get too much of a load on it because we're pressuring down that's that's wanting to curve out basically exactly so because we turned the board's perpendicular we stopped the ability of the board to deflect under a load in that x-axis anymore so that was the only way we fail is just like a tree standing in the forest it we want the weight to go straight down so we actually go take the weight all the way down so we're actually certified to hold eight thousand six hundred pounds versus only about 2,200 pounds for a 2x6 and about 900 pounds for a two-by-four Wow quite a bit stronger Bryan that's pretty cool yeah I can admit it was impressive a two-footer held thirty thirty six thousand pounds oh my gosh that's crazy yeah Bryan when I look around the house I don't see that there's any color difference between bottom plates and studs are you selling pressure-treated or how we keeping termites rot that kind of thing happening at the bottom plates we're going to start treating all of our products with next-gen so it's a four in one solution rot mold fire and termite all in one so you'll have the option to buy them with all treated or just the plain tea studs by themselves so you can actually get a Class A rated T stud is that right that's right now Bryan tell me about options this is the tea said they used here which is basically like a two by six replacement what are the other options we could buy from you okay so this we call this the Barenaked tea stud so it's the same frame if you're gonna do spray foam in the cavity you can spray us in in the in the field itself so that so frame the house with the naked tea stud no insulation in already so this is in the wall correct and this is your demo to show that right so here's your sheathing on the outside the tea stud now is here and so then you could spray from the bottom plate let's say from your slab spray in between and continuous from the slab all the way to the roof line right correct and you run put the Barenaked tea studs in run all your lectric old wiring security system whatever you want to run through so you can run everything you want to through there and then spray foam us and in the so you can either do you know one two three inches or all five and a quarter inches of foam whatever however you want to see that and that way you have solved for almost all of your transitions of where you could potentially have air leaks coming into that cavity plus if you've got two pounds spray foam that you're spraying that with you're adding a ton of structure right you I've seen tests before with with two inches of closed cell foam and just half-inch sheeting where a two by four shot out of a hundred mile an hour can and will bounce off so my guess is you're gonna add a lot of hurricane tornado resistant to the house as well if you did this method so we're already hurricane compliant and seismic compliant by ourselves with just this t stud this T stud we know that we're gonna be able to pass all the hurricane testing without the sheathing on that's pretty amazing and then tell me about this guy right here we actually did the boston passive house conference and they have asked us for an hour 30 t stud because they want to get rid of all the staggered stud walls dang so this is an AR 30 version our thirty place basically a two by eight where we are equal in strength to a two by eight in a wall up to 16 feet tall with that but we only have five inches of fiber wow that's pretty cool in our value thirty so we actually heated up that wood member to 200 degrees and we had no transfer to the other side after eight hours wow that's pretty neat so that's that's sick it's impressive Brian I got to say I've never heard of this before thoroughly intriguing so for people watching this video whether you're someone who's about to build a house or a builder how do we buy this how do we get all your product you have a couple of options you can have your lumber yard contact us and we'll set them up as a stocking dealer right away okay if there's nobody stocking in the area we will bundle up whatever that you need to have and we're going to ship it to you direct just have a forklift there to pick it off and so we'll ship directly out of Canada I don't or we'll send partial loads to the lumberyard we'll do whatever it takes to get the tea stones out there that's pretty cool so how do people contact you Brian what's the best way to get a hold of you guys sales at T stud comm the letter T then stud calm calm he stud calm Fred and can you guys help builders out there let's say if I've got a house coming up in two months I'm gonna pour a slab for can you guys help do the takeoffs if I've got a traditionally framed a house and convert that to a two sub takeoff yeah well we'll do those right away we'll actually try to half ways try to compare ourselves to a 2x6 or whatever yet you were going to do especially when it comes to you value calculations or the average r-value we can show you the U value through this for those of you are educated you value for this is 0.03 to 3 Brian last question I know people are gonna be asking cost tell me about let's say a standard 2500 square-foot house what's the Delta how much more are we gonna pay for a t stud compared to traditional number okay so the average house in North America 2500 square feet so we're a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars extra versus a two by six Wow so the more complex the house obviously the more costs to have involved we have a couple of 2,800 square foot two-story houses going right now full basement walkouts they're extremely complex ten-foot on the main floor second floor nine feet tall and we're 5,000 extra and that's the retail price today that's amazing and then there's gonna be some deduct right I mean my guess is with an are twenty stud you're probably gonna use less of a heating and cooling system you may you may be able to forego the geothermal that you might have might have wanted for efficiency because now you really don't need it you could use more standard let's say vrf equipment you're gonna get fantastic air tightness when you couple this with a Huber zip system on the exterior right because we've got a really tight envelope it's impressive

"JPCt-yCTvMA": "what's up guys I want to talk about how to roll up an extension cord one of my biggest pet peeves is when people roll my extension cords and what I see a lot okay there's people doing this all right so roll up extension cord like this is fine if you have one or if you have a whole bunch of hooks for every single one of your extension cords what you have at the end when you're all done okay one now I'm dirty okay my clothes or whatever and then two I have to put this big thing on a hook and you can only put it on one hook and then at the end of the day you're trying to get everything out and you're doing this and then when you're trying to unroll it you have you know 100 frickin little rolls in order to get it out or you can try to throw it but then you get it wind up with a tangled mess another thing I see people doing which just bothers me to no end is when they do this little gimmicky thing all right and I think it's so cool that at the end of it you can sit there grab it and everything pulls out now I only did a little bit imagine an entire cord this big how are you suppose to store this alright I mean it's just it's ridiculous and it's annoying alright now the proper way to roll up a cord is to let it hang straight ahead like this okay you get six foot length or somewhat six foot lengths it's very it's much faster than rolling around your arm much cleaner and the trick it's at the end see this is this right here wound up from the me rolling around my arm so if you're always winding up with all these curves and stuff like that you're doing it yourself by rolling around your arm that won't happen if you do it my way all right so now I'm getting to the end okay so I have one more loop to go all right so I was trying to figure out the words to explain you come over you have one more loop left okay you grab it and you drop so basically that's two loops again you come over I have I know this is gonna be my last loop so I hold this come over here drop and basically drop it now what you do did you grab this and you wrap it okay now that's gonna be the hard part stick your hand in the hole you grab it now you can put a whole bunch chords by hooking it now if that's one more time I'm gonna do it again alright so you understand what just happened when I wrapped it around okay I stick my hand in the hole grabbed it now this right here is never gonna go in that hole I pull it push it through now I can sit there and put a whole bunch of things a whole bunch of cords on there now when I take it apart it's very easy put your hand in unravel it you take the one end let me see this is where my plug is I plug it in and then I just walk to wherever I want to go so one more time I'm here this is my last one basically you just drop it so you have a long one wrap it around now if you don't want to do all that at least in the least just grab this and put it through the hole and hang it that's probably the simplest way of doing it I like mine to be clean and I'm anal so I like it to be in the middle but I mean all right so if you like tips and tricks subscribe to the channel I do these all the time things that I find make my life easier I'm going to share like storing chords so uh put it through the hole so I'll hit the like button makes feel good hook a brother Subscribe", "BlQ3yuUmBiw": "as we age we can be faced with some pretty extreme challenges one of them being a loss of mobility which can end up really meaning a loss of your independence today though we've traveled to Victoria to meet one very inspiring lady who has built a beautiful tiny house that's given her a completely new lease on life [Music]  hello moe hello dries lovely to meet you ensign what an absolutely beautiful home you have here my hand and it's all because of this wonderful woman standing next to you - how are you good thanks for asking itself very well thank you can you tell me a little bit about how this home came to be um well realizing a dream for a month you know my mum's getting what do you call it not older no I'm more mature aged more mature aged that's what we call it my mom was in a position where she was moving back to Victoria where we live with this beautiful cold weather and didn't want to go into something permanent and away from the family so we took a journey and said well let's board your tiny we just finished building a tiny for a girlfriend so I said well one for my month I didn't want to invest in a property so when my daughter suggested a tiny house I was very receptive and then when she out made a design and how it would read I jumped at it because it was ideal I didn't want my retirement money tied up in a house that I had to do upkeep and and I don't want it affairs I want to enjoy one and I am so thrilled that I jumped at their idea and things evolved from there and so I end up with the family which is ideal well definitely is a very chilly day today isn't it it is yeah it is price move inside when it's for me let's do that thank you this is so charming what wonderful views you have from here it is good the kangaroos in the morning isn't it mom it's also babies this morning they're not coming up say good night one of the things that I immediately notice about this house is everything is just so accessible isn't it you've got the ramp leading right up to this entranceway because this is a completely different structure from the tiny house isn't it yes it is yes and it's also built dismountable so it would take a day for us to dismantle and then put things back together again still perfectly mature age accessible yes thank you my mum just being of that age where she's not getting more agile she's getting less agile so everything's built in like the door frame is built into the frame of that tiny so there's no trip hazard even going external as you can see the flooring going up the veranda and then the certain grip on the tread so bombs me on the house just over six months and she hasn't had a fall once it's awesome that is brilliant and I don't even have to look at the feet when I'm walking in you can immediately see just how much of a well-designed and comfortable home this is but I suppose the best thing about this situation is that you get to be so close together and to a daughter it's not it's not me Bryce it's the granddaughter being traced to my family is very important the grandchildren and great-grandchildren they grow so quickly one minute they're babies and the next they're toddlers the next thing that going to school so to have those childhood years and have them know their grandmother I think it's a very important to me and I think it is important to them it is all important being nice to family mums living in a tiny house yes but with the extended space on a Friday evening you know the extended family come and it's just a comfortable place to be it's just a space that we all just come to so what are the dimensions of this home the tiny is 7.2 by 2.5 wide so it would be what you'd say the a typical size in Australia and then the veranda is the same length 7.2 but by 3.2 wide and then there's a gap between the veranda and the tiny to meet regulations but then we board that up so we've got screws we board that up and there's three flashings so there's flashings on the other side and on the roof and then that seals it and you find that you're spending more time inside the tiny house or more time here in this room more time in this room because of my craft room I like the friendly neat whereas I can spread out and here but I wouldn't dream have taken my craft work in there and messing up my beautiful beautiful but normal day-to-day living I leave it out and making awful ways but not in the fiddly so the friendly Bryce is what mum has christened her home so myself daughter the baby being fern and my older sister being Leander Orly so mum christened the home friendly oh that's lovely so before we check out inside the Fernley can you tell me about this patio area yes so what was important to Mum was having options so having an option that if we sold the farm or did something to the farm that her capital investment wasn't in something that was in bricks and mortar invested in the ground here so with the extended veranda here or the patio we build it in such a way that it is dismantle so we can take this apart we've done the insulation on the inside this winter to see how it went for the winter weather we need to plaster it or not but the insulation has been awesome this winter so it's been fine we've just put perspex on the ends to help enclose but still have that aspect of looking out and on the front there's three big areas here you can see we've got a cafe blinds and then flyscreens so if you've got the cafe blind and the flying screen in the evening it provides that insulation and then we've got the option of having the cafe blinds down looking out or in an evening or in a hot damn I'm gonna have the fly screens down have the air coming through but without the insects that we have here in Australia and what's extra clever about that is this one here on the end is actually motorised as well as it is that's right so having that more mature aspect in mind having things that are push-button or easy to use with the hands so for the blinds the cafe blinds and the fly screens are all manual lifts and clothes and then the one at the end as you have said we've got that on a motorized so mum can just push a button and it can go up and down well can we go inside the Fernley and take a look absolutely yeah come inside  this is beautiful it is lovely isn't it price we just love it it's quite modern as well with the finishing on the walls yes designing for your mother is no different designing for any client sitting down and asking where have you lived before that you like what is it you liked about that what's the feeling you want and mum wanted something to pop like something that had a bit of shine or a shimmer to it but also the timber look and the open sort of space so we did a combination of the cedar windows and the big expensive sort of windows and a neat glass so it's a neat glass rather than double glazed and then we use the luca bond so a luca bond as a commercial product is on the external of a lot of um buildings but we've brought it inside here and so it's the luca bond wall covering and it's a standard framing like we've done a noted by 45 framing standard house insulation and we've got installation under the floor in the walls and the ceiling we've got a solid base trailer and we raised the floor above the wheel lunches so completely flat so what we built here we don't have to deal with that complexity of where's the wheel at and then can you tell me a little bit about the way that you've designed this home so we've got underfloor heating and it only one takes about thirty dollars a week to run and it's no different than doing a small bathroom or a small bedroom and it keeps that ambient temperature for mum and particularly you know when you're walking around if your feet are warm particularly when you're older if you feed a warm you can sort of deal with everything and it's got a non-slip floor which is actually built particularly for bathrooms but we've built it throughout the tiny home and everything's soft touch so whether it be the cabinetry the door was the age-specific bathroom where it's got the toilet specifically made for older people to get up and down from the toilet and then with the shower we've got a non-slip vinyl floor a shower seat and then specific railing and just putting an extra noggins and everything so you've got your hand railing so if mommy ever does need to grab onto the railing it's all very secure we wanted to have a bed that went up and down from under in a way during the day so again mum didn't have to deal with the Murphy bed in the wall or a loft where climbing up stairs and steps was not you know not an option for us or having something permanent out was not an option mum is with many people of her generation you know if you have people into your home space you want them to see your bed so what we've done here Bryce is the lift bed so it runs off a 12 volt battery and it has a channel that goes up through the wall and then just sits up on the ceiling during the day and then comes down at night and then all the cabinetry behind it if I could show you that yeah - show the cabinetry so with the cabinetry Bryce everything is all soft touch so everything and craft work and clothing and DVDs and then extra storage for pantry or the like and then this has got storage all underneath it as well as well as pullout drawers for everything here so mum has found that she's got more storage in this space than what she had basically in one of her you know taught her rooms in her own house this door here slides along and then it comes up to a table so mum can sit there with their computer or her dinner and have that or have it away for the space so it's not you know running into that in the middle of the evening very very clever now when it comes to the bed do you find that okay to get in and out of because it's still quite high isn't it when that comes down yeah still a little hop up there no problem but Finn is having a snick night for it to make it easier and when under that more mature I might need it and I can see you've actually got a skylight up there as well not my skylight the night of the Eclipse that was just absolutely fantastic how wonderful and then the kitchen area behind us here so we've purpose-built that again Bryce - mums requirement so the benches lowered so it's easy for mum to navigate and cook and everything yet and with most Hani's you'll have the gas hob top what we've chosen with mum is induction for safety so if mum takes the pot off that it automatically switches off so it's got that safety element to it and the ovens got a safety switch on it and it's also got a safety off timer on the oven as well one of the things mum loves and she's pointing out here right is the tap the water nozzle comes and mum can use it for washing the dishes the vegetables and it's quite a large sink so whether it be vegetables or cleaning or anything mum can sort of like move things around which is good for her and so what about the accessibility in here so accessibility Bryce what we've done here again with mums has made it so in the future mum needs to use a wheelchair it's all wheelchair accessible at the moment mum you'll will use a walker every now and again every odd day that she's not feeling a hundred percent and we've done it so that mum can get the Walker in through the kitchen and into the bathroom space and in all of her living area so it's all what we say aged disability friendly with the ease of access for things with your hands and then be able to get a walker in a wheelchair through I suppose more than anything one of the best things about this home is that you're able to be completely independent here on you yes said something quite different from the volume me and home I had a little saying which was beautiful home but of a three-level and I didn't need help to maintain it the home has given me more independence because I like to be completely independent and I don't need to be dependent on anyone I don't need anyone coming in to help me share or anything because it's all so beautifully laid out for me especially I don't need anyone to come in and clean for me because it's so easy to do myself and I haven't got a whole day doing housework which I hate because it only takes me half an air but the independence it gives me but the tiny nurse of it and yet every single thing that I had in a four bedroom home everything is so easy to use so easy to clean so easy to live and more than easy it's a joy so what would you say right now your absolute favorite thing about living here is everything absolutely everything my favourites their own fragrance price you're asking me a very hard question I love the underfloor heating I love the openness the safety the security I tell my daughter he was designed at forming and so beautifully that is my little bit of heaven best present she's ever given to me it's the scenery the Kangaroos and the rabbits they keep distracting me from my cry for it but very pleasurably the experiences I'm getting living here and being able to live here and such safety and security is just that little bit of heaven so what do I love best Oh Bryce it would be just everything and what about the cost of this setup so the tiny itself was $85,000 to build the extension area was about 15,000 and then the blinds there were the high quality in Bryans for that I was six seven thousand dollars for those so if you take the 85 to the 1516 and then the seven or eight that's the construction costs and then what we did we did some excavation for the site so all up out of pocket it's been about 140 hundred fifty thousand dollars out of pocket and that's what all the garden beds everything but what's really priceless is the quality of life that this has given you isn't it absolutely that is exactly it the days just aren't long enough and I want years and years of it thank you to be on the property here the spaciousness and the openness of having nobody around me is just terrific it is print quality beauty and with the family goes it's just a dream which without the wee tiny years I couldn't repay well you are such a beautiful soul and this is such a wonderful home and it's so great to see the way that the family has come together to make this a reality thank you so much for sharing your wonderful thank you rice thank you thank you thank you I love sharing my beautiful home mm-hmm I know people can be they have a look at it I did I really appreciate you doing so thank you very much this is a very cleverly designed home there has been so much attention put into each and every detail to make sure that this is a place where Mel can be completely cozy completely warm but most of all completely independent here in these walls Mel needs to rely on absolutely nobody and that is what makes this place truly home  [Music] you", "UP4GqXQsZbU": "I was up extra early this morning not by design but by chance and I thought you know as long as I'm up may as well get the day going going to a little bit of groceries and get my baking soda and so I checked the website for superstore and it says they're open at 7:00 well it's about 10:00 to 7:00 by the time I got to superstore it was just after 7:00 and I'm seeing the store looks like it's closed and I'm thinking well what's wrong now and I pulled around to the front and here's a bunch of employees standing outside and they said a transformer just blew we've had a power failure so off to Safeway I go and that's where I got my baking soda let's get going here oh and I did get some other stuff too now I have no idea how this is gonna go I've never done this before so I want to do a little sample first just to see how the CA glue will will react by the way this spoon don't know if you remember about a few years ago I did a video called something like the homemade gouge or something like that the idea was gonna use a ordinary tablespoon to make a gouge well interestingly that video has had more hits than any other video I've ever posted yeah let's see what happens here  now I turn on the room air cleaner here to circulate they're just a little bit but in one drop  yeah I was afraid it might blow him up all over the place but obviously it's not  I can smell it  there may be somebody wondering what's this all about anyway well a couple of days ago I made a mistake and I cut in the wrong place so I had to fill up the gap and I used wood and it was suggested to me at that time that why don't you use baking soda and CA glue and so that's what this is all about and this repair is just about exactly the same size as what I had done a couple of days ago only of course with wood now I got to keep the baking powder and the crack this is the one we want to repair right well this is just plain old scotch tape I don't know what you call it where you live but I call it scotch tape even though it might not be from the Scotch company yeah I'll just flip that over and I'll do the other side now  yeah I think that's fairly well sealed I know that the liquid CA glue is going to follow the grain of the wood and so code a little bit but hopefully I'm not going to put in too much and I end up with it running down the side here anyway that's the next step well I guess the next step is to pack it full of baking powder  no I don't know if tamping it down is a good idea or not I would think it's a good idea  well let's try that now I don't know if we're gonna be able to see it or not but I think the idea would be to put it on quickly and then when you see it has reached the very bottom well that should be enough  I forgot to put on my Rome air cleaner  [Music]  well as you can see I've laid the dome on its side here about five minutes or so is past I think we can probably take the tape off here okay what have we got soft or hard oh that's not good okay I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit more on right there where I made that dent and then I'll drop the CA in from this side then I'll turn it over and I'll do the same thing on the other side  I know I can always sound this down later but thanks we'll try and get it as good as we can okay here we go  now I have a feeling that this CA glue sets so quickly that it doesn't get a chance to get all the way down into the center of the repair  my other wanna be gluing this to my table-saw either another mistake should have put down the waxed paper oh one more drop what do you think  doesn't seem to be soaking it any more it's it's not curing either I don't see the PM's coming off well leave that for a few minutes to see it we got we'll see what happens when we cut through it and actually that'll because that's the whole idea it's supposed to you know like what we did the other day with a wooden repair and yes I did get a little on the table saw  yeah we'll say that's very hard well this doesn't have to be a perfect sanding job let's just cut through it and just cut through or come on this side over here so the spacing is even the way the wheel was when we're trying to fix the wheel remember here here here and here so the spacing can be the same anyway doesn't really matter I guess  well I can see where this would work okay but not the way I did it what I should have done was to build it up about a Oh eighth of an inch of the time it's sure is strong though I'll say that for it you can see that the inside there it's Hollow  yeah well next time  now as for this box of baking soda I'm gonna keep some of it in a little sealed container down here in the workshop and the rest can go on the fridge isn't that what most people do with theirs [Music]", "9pgx_VPmJx8": "", "P-e6oOyrQ04": "[Applause] hey there guys today I'm going to be doing a Q&A video of my rainwater harvesting system for those of you who don't know I live in the Arizona desert off of almost 100% rain water we don't have a well we don't have city water we pretty much just rely on what falls on the roof so today I'm going to try to answer the most common questions that I've received since I originally did my rainwater harvesting tour video about two or three years ago and for those of you who haven't seen that video I'll put a link down below but I'll also do a quick recap before we get on to questions so let's get started so as just a basic recap my rainwater harvesting system essentially is just me collecting water off of my roof and funneling it into gutters around my house which then funnel into downspouts and run underground until they hit my rain tanks where I store the water treat the water and then eventually pump the water to my house for household use [Music]  do we have a well or access to city or town water no we don't when we started getting estimates to build our house we actually looked into having a well drilled but he saw that the estimates were well in excess of 10,000 or 15,000 dollars with no guarantee of water we haven't live in a very rocky environment and that is actually what led us to start looking into rainwater collection as well as the fact that my wife's grandparents that actually live in the mountains just behind there have been living off of rainwater for I don't know 4050 years  the total capacity of this system is roughly 11,000 gallons and that is comprised of four main tanks the tan tank back there is my rain tank and that holds roughly 5,000 gallons and is buried about halfway in the ground this green tank holds 3,000 gallons and that green tank holds twenty-six hundred and fifty gallons and then the culvert cistern on the front of my house holds roughly about 1,100 gallons those four tanks comprise all of my household water and general use water I do have other holding capacities in IBC totes and things like that but I'll touch on that a bit later  what is the total square footage of my roof that I'm clicking rainwater off of it is somewhere between thirty-seven hundred and thirty-nine hundred square feet no that is not all interior house space that includes two really big porches and it exercised garage so about half of that square footage is the porches and garage and the other half is the the living quarters inside and how does that work in the conversions well the easiest way is to figure for every thousand square feet of collection space you can get roughly 600 gallons of water per inch of rain  so what do we do to treat and filter our water and deal with algae growth in our tanks well to be honest our tanks really never have a problem with algae growth they're pretty much impervious to light but as a just-in-case factor I do from time to time add just a tiny bit of chlorine to the tanks just to make sure nothing is growing I know some people are going to freak out saying oh my gosh what are you doing well if you live in pretty much any city there is probably way more chlorine in your water than is in this water additionally this water is used for everything in the household but cooking and drinking water it gets an additional filtration and I'll tell you about that now so what we use to filter our water pretty much all of the water in our house is unfiltered rain water sinks showers faucets those are just straight rainwater we obviously let it set them it out in the rain tank before we transfer it but other than that it's just rain as for cooking and drinking water that is all done through this this is a Berkey ceramic gravity powered water filter the filter is comprised of two separate chambers the top chamber is where you fill the water and also where you have your ceramic filtration elements you can have up to four but I just have to because I guess we're cheap and then that water just percolates down here into perfectly good drinking water we've been using this system for about eight years now with no problems and we're very very happy with it and it really comes out to be pennies per gallon if not cheaper so it's a really cost effective solution as well  do I do any other forms of water collection other than my main house system yes I do starting with the sunken greenhouse I collect water off of that roof and channel it down to my garden where it is stored in to IBC totes those of you who have followed that project will know I plan on adding another couple IBC totes to that additionally I also collect water off of my chicken coop roof and channel it into a blue barrel that eventually feeds the chicken waters down at the end of my road I collect water that runs off of my Road into two little retention ponds that services a rainwater garden that I will hopefully soon be upgrading this summer to add some fruit trees to over in the same area I also collect water on a billboard tarp collector that channels water into an IBC tote that will also be there to serve those fruit trees and that rainwater garden and then on the backside of the property I also collect water in another billboard tarp setup that I don't think I've shown on video but that collects into a couple of 55-gallon drums that hopefully will get upgraded soon and that is being developed as kind of like a wildlife water and then on the last note my shipping containers shop I'm hoping to put another one of these types of cisterns right next to it which I'll probably have an installation video and all that stuff for you as well and I think that's about it nope that's not it I forget to mention I also collect water by way of a swale that I built along the front side of my yard and the front portion of my driveway that channels rain runoff water down to my garden area and eventually channels all that water into my fruit tree wells so they get watered every time it rains maybe more than a quarter inch  so probably one of the most common questions I get asked from folks in regard to this system is why I don't have a first flush diverter or a first flush device on my gutters to collect the first few gallons or liters of dirty rainwater while it's cleaning off the roof and not direct that water into my tanks there's a few reasons why I chose not to install one on my system and the first of those is just simply the cost I didn't want to buy the extra piping and bail fitting and clean out cap that would have taken to make a good first flush system additionally I wasn't exactly sure how I was going to mount it off of my eaves right by the gutters there because obviously if it's going to hold several gallons of water is going to be pretty heavy and I just didn't want to deal with that at the time another reason why I chose not to have one on my system is that before I design this whole setup I went and toured some places in the city of Tucson that had first flush devices on their systems and when I checked the insides of their tank I've still found that some silt and dirt sediment was getting through to their tanks I'm not sure if the first flushes were being maintained or emptied out regularly but I kind of started figuring that if a first flush doesn't have say 20 to 30 gallons worth of roof flush to truly clean out the roof and gutters it just wasn't going to be worth it to have a single pipe that might only hold four or five gallons I'm not saying they're not effective and I really think there are cool systems I'm just saying it wasn't right for my per my specific situation another reason is that I also have my rain tank which is that big tan tank and that serves in my mind to collect all of the sediment and in a sense act as my own first flush for the entire system and the last reason I've chosen to forego the first flush is that now I take a little bit of a preventative measure and I simply walk around my gutters with a handheld vacuum a little shop vac in a PVC pipe and I simply just vacuum out the debris and dust and anything else that might be in the gutters before our rainy seasons and that usually takes me all of about 10 minutes to do  is rainwater slightly more acidic than the average ground water source yes as rain falls through the air carbon dioxide dissolves within the rain droplets to create what's known as carbonic acid now does that mean the rainwater is acid rain no it means it's slightly more acidic on a pH scale and in the grand scheme of things do I really think that's a problem no I kind of reckon it to a 300 horsepower car versus a 320 horsepower car are you really even going to know the difference probably not  what do we do about bird poop and other contaminants that might end up on the roof I don't even worry about it every time I've ever gone up there I have rarely seen any bird poop and even if anything was up there it would get sterilized and baked by the Sun and its UV rays and then anything that goes into our bodies is it going to get treated and filtered additionally so I just think it's not a problem have we ever had our water officially tested no but I do know that our local AG Extension Office has done Studies on homes with similar style roofs that also collect rainwater and the results have always been positive  another really common question that I'm often asked is whether rainwater harvesting is illegal in my area thankfully I can tell you here in Arizona it is not only legal but even encouraged I have heard that some other places that are rainwater harvesting is either regulated frowned upon or even illegal in some circumstances for the life of me I can't understand that kind of political thinking but I think it is rooted somehow in water rights issues about runoff water going downstream and being available to the next person but even then I still think the argument doesn't really hold very strong because if you think about it before a house or a road or a parking lot existed that ground was open so when it rained on that ground most of the water would probably soak in and sure yeah some of it would run downstream but the way I look at it is if I'm harvesting the water off of my roof holding it in the tank using it on my gardener for my own household needs I'm putting the majority of that water back where it originally would have gone anyway  the system could be cleaned of any dirt or debris by way of two clean-out caps one located right here  and the other one located right at the base of this tree right here  another super common question is whether I did all of this installation by myself or did I hire a company to do it well I hope I didn't hire a company because it's definitely not perfect but yes I did it all by myself I did the trenches and laying the pipe and hanging the gutters and placing all of the tanks except for the tan rain tank I had a guy with the backhoe come over and help me dig the hole to place that about halfway in the ground and then my father-in-law helped with the culvert cistern on the front but everything else is pretty much by myself with my wife giving me some moral support and coming out and and helping from time to time as well  another one really questions I get from folks is in regard to water conservation being that we are on rain water we do have a limited water supply so we definitely do conserve things like low-flow showerheads low-flow toilets water efficient appliances all apply but what it really comes down to is just having a little bit of mindfulness when you use water and just being a little disciplined don't take really long showers don't be super wasteful when you're watering plants it's pretty simple really additionally we also use grey water to great effect you'll see that little square back there with a pump on it that is sitting right above our gray water tank and what I'm doing right now is just pumping water out of there to water my fruit trees  okay so now we are into the more thoughtful segment of the QA well maybe not more thoughtful but for me it is  okay cost and plans for the future a lot of people ask me about the cost of the system and I've traditionally said like 42 to 45 hundred or there abouts and that's because I negated including the culvert cistern but roughly all of the three plastic poly tanks were about $3500 and then adding the covert cistern brings it to about four thousand because I was about a five hundred dollar install and then all of the PVC pipes and gutters and those things came out to be about nine hundred bucks so let's just call it five thousand to be safe now that number may scare a lot of people off but I don't think it should because this number will vary greatly depending on where you are in the country for instance I have to hold a lot of water to make it from one rain to the next but say someone in Seattle or another place might be able to get away with a thousand gallon tank because they're always getting it recharged so I think that's definitely an important thing to remember for folks now too a lot of you that may seem ridiculously expensive but for me it was the best option one thing I do like to point out though is that it is one of those capital expenditures or investments that pays you back over time in my case this system has paid for itself over and over and over because you have to remember I don't have a water bill I might pay for one or two deliveries of water each year but the system of you know the time that I've gone in months without having a water bill if you tally up those numbers you know say water bills fifty bucks or a hundred bucks depending on where you're at well over months and months and months and years eventually that adds up to the fact that my system is paid for yes I will have to maintain it so that'll definitely be a cost that will happen in the future these tanks are rated for 25 to 30 years sometimes I've heard they can go 40 years if they're taken care of and painted but obviously that will be a capital expenditure I'll have in the future but you just have to remember everything has a perspective to it and you need to look at it in right light but at least until then I'm not paying a water bill  and that leads me into plans for the future what plans do I have to either improve this system or add additional rainwater harvesting capabilities well in the short term it's simply to just add capacity where I can whether it's an IBC tote or specifically in regards to this shop I plan on installing another culvert cistern on the western side to not only collect water but also to give shade additional to that I want to install a rain roof which is kind of like my tarp collectors that I installed this last summer but it's an idea I got from my buddy Derek at life inside a box they installed a huge rain roof with the corrugated roofing to catch potable water for their tiny house and off-grid property and even additional to that in more of an earthworks perspective I want to install a large-scale swale system on the back side of my property to collect all the runoff rainwater into a pond and tin plant some perennial plants and fruit trees at the base of that pond or the dam or whatever I end up building but that will probably be a year or two out so if anybody local has a really good backhoe or a mini excavator let me know I could definitely use it well that's pretty much it guys I hope it was informative I'm sure I didn't get to everyone's questions but I did try to focus on the 15 to 20 most commonly asked questions but if you do have further questions just put them down below and I will try to get to them when I get to them but as always I appreciate you watching give a thumbs up if you liked this and I will see you next time", "QovaMj9bkc0": "the first thing you're going to need to get is an old microwave preferably one that doesn't work so you can get it for free  you  first thing you're going to do is take every screw out of this microwave that you can find on the outside every microwaves a little different you have to look all the way around it to find every one of them and in this case we have a star slotted screw and I don't have a star wrench so I'm actually going to use my cut-off grinder to cut the heads off that  we've taken the door off by opening it as far as it'll go until it snaps then it comes right off we've taken the screws completely out of back in the bottom all over the thing now the hood part oughta just come right off just like that so let's see what's inside  so now let's look at the guts of the microwave here's where it all happens  right down here you see the capacitor that's a very dangerous thing to mess with I'm going to show you how to short that out but if you've never done this or at least don't know what you're doing don't mess with it it's not worth it and stay away from it but if you know what you're doing you can short it out using a couple screwdrivers  on this microwave you can see the capacitor is hooked to the fan housing which was pretty easy to just pull out of there when I mess around with any of that area around the capacitor I always use something like pair of pliers or in this case I have some wire cutters with insulated grips to it just to help prevent getting shocked  here's your capacitor the way I short these out is I take two screwdrivers in each terminal and I cross them I touch them now sometimes you'll hear a loud pop but in this case it seems to be already safe but I still don't trust it so I'm not going to mess with them I'll keep my hands off of it and set it aside I'll show you where the magnets are the magnetron is in this silver box right here we're going to have to take that off and in this case doesn't look too hard so wherever there's a screw take the screw out it's a nut take a wrench to it now I'm just going to start clipping wires to remove the rest of this stuff to make it easier to get to the magnetron  you  as you can see I've cleared every from the magnetron and if you look over to the side you can see in there the two magnets and that's what we're going to try to get out to take this off you can see there are screws holding it on each side so we're going to take those off and it should just come right down  so what I like to do is put magnetron and vice vice it down really good to where you can get to those magnets now you're going to take the housing off as you can see there are tabs that secure the housing together so what I like to do is to take some channel locks and put them in there and then I just pull like that and I'll do that all the way around the magnetron casing on each side to pull those tabs out  now the next one's a little harder to take out what I like to do is get a screwdriver in here and just start prying until it breaks loose and just kind of go all the way around it there you go this little thing comes out and there you have your other magnet  every microwave is different by manufacturer you'll see where this microwave was pretty simple to take apart some are more complexed but now you kind of know the anatomy of a microwave the larger microwaves have larger magnets smaller ones have smaller magnets  you", "AqjRcQabs_c": "when it comes to conventional housing it's not uncommon for people to ask themselves the question do I own my house or does my house own me and that's exactly the realization this next couple came to before they decided to break them all and build themselves a tiny house on wheels today we've traveled to Armstrong and British Columbia to check it out [Music] hey Sara how's it going good how are you good thank you lovely to meet you can i all of them great to meet you good to meet you as well this is such a charming looking tiny house you first of all can you tell me what it was that actually inspired both of you to built this yes it was a big life change for us we got married we bought the big house we were working so hard to pay the big bills on the big house and we just found we lost touch with what we really enjoyed in life which was hiking climbing and just getting outside and enjoying nature so we were looking for a change and the tiny house was the change Oliver had the building side of things and I had design skills so we went for it yeah the house design was sort of inspired by we wanted to create something that looked like an actual house so something that had the characteristics the feel sort of the character of sort of a heritage house or an old house that would have some of those elements in it and we sort of took those elements and brought him into the house and tried to create something that didn't look just like a square box it was you know had some depth to it and showed really well and I've always loved heritage homes with characters so I wanted to take that and just shrink it into the tiny home the style of the house is really lovely you've really nailed that heritage look especially the way that you've got these jewel dormers is really interesting can you talk to me about how you did all this yeah we obviously wanted to bring the roofline out where the loft is to sort of bring the ceiling height up in the loft this one up here we wanted to incorporate that again just to try to give it a little bit of character and try to give it that Heritage feel as well as it obviously takes the snow load and the rain and sheds it away from the front door so that was one thing that gave it some architectural detail as well as a feature that to keep snow and everything off of the front door now you've actually designed and built this tiny house together can you talk to me about what that process was like it was actually pretty easy working together there's some moments where you kind of had to trust me with my design ideas but then he found out in the end that it was for a good reason and it worked out and it was really handy having him being on the other side of things for the building because I could kind of tell them what to do yeah there's always those design details that I questioned throughout the build then I go I have no idea how this is gonna turn out but obviously through the process the color schemes everything sort of coincides together and and that's where serious strengths are really good and that's where I may be lacking a little bit you know I can put it together but putting it together in my mind on the design side of things can be challenging so Sierra's sort of took that by the horns and did a really good job at the same time it was great cuz Oliver was able to rein me in as well because I had some crazy design ideas and Oliver was like you know that's not exactly gonna work so I think that's where the teamwork really came in two things and before going tiny you were living in a larger home and the inspiration for the design of this tiny house was actually taken from your previous home wasn't it yes our house in town actually is a bigger version of this it has the gray siding the weight trim the cool shingle detailing and when we moved into the tiny house I loved our first house so much that I just wanted to take it and shrink it and to make it into a little mini version I think that's so special how you've taken your favorite aspects from your previous large house and you've downsized it all into this one yeah it's pretty unique we wanted to bring those elements from our big house into here to make it feel like it was home and I think that was executed really well before we take a look inside the house as well can we talk about this parking spot because you're in a very idyllic location here on you yes we got so lucky with this it's family land and we share it with family members of ours and we couldn't ask for a better spot it's private and it's all about the nature and quiet peaceful now I notice you've got some solar panels on the roof so is this house designed to be off the grid because I see you're also hooked into some services here so how does will that work yeah it is designed to be fully off-grid we sort of wanted to incorporate that into the initial build we do use the services when we have access to them but it's got three solar panels on the roof one panel on the ground for solar tracking and then all the heating inside is all propane so that really takes the electrical load off of the solar end of things we also incorporated tanks into this to be able to have some fresh water if that was ever something that we wanted to do we're obviously hooked up to services here but we wanted to sort of keep the options open and really explore the potential of what a tiny house could do for the off-grid and what size is this tiny house this house is 24 feet in length eight and a half feet wide by 13 foot six high and it's given that approximately 225 square feet so pretty compact I really love the look of this house the way that you've broken up the lines with the interesting window shapes and these jewel dilemmas is really nice and I am very intrigued to see what it's like on the inside can we take a look totally let's take a look thank you this is just so nice thank you I especially like the way that walking in here you just have this incredible view of the forest even from this lovely skylight you've got here in the center yeah it was super important the number one thing on my list was Windows on Windows and Windows I'm a big natural light person and for us we didn't really need much wall space to put things on it was more important to be able to look out and see the nature around us mainly because we have a pretty fantastic parking spot but I find that even if you're inside it feels like you're outside yeah the space with this amount of natural light brings just everything in we have 15 windows we've got 3 3 by 3 skylights so it really really opens up the space for sure when there's that much natural light coming in for a house this size 15 windows is almost ridiculous isn't it it is yeah there was definitely moments where during the framing stages I was like this too many can you have too many windows but I mean now we look at it and we're happy that we did every window has its purpose yeah and again that's sort of the trade-off with all the windows and the skylights it will gain some heat in in the summertime but you'll also get that gained in the wintertime as well so that can definitely help heating costs and just keeping the space warm having that Sun actually come in if it's out does definitely benefit the house for sure well with winters being super long and cold there's days where you're kind of held up and it gets dark early so I find having all the windows around you even though you're stuck inside seeing all the snowfall and the beautiful winter around you it doesn't make you feel as cooped up as you normally would feel well the style in here is an absolute dream you've done such a great job with all the decoration in here can you tell me what was the kind of inspiration that you were going for with all this I've always been a fan of white on white lots of white it's just very calming it's relaxing white never goes out of style and it makes the space feel bigger and brighter we did add some extra warmth with the hemlock touches on the flooring and the stair treads and shelves so I found it kind of gave it a good balance and we brought a little pop of color with the green gray cabinets one of the things that I really liked about the way that you've decorated the home as well as the use of plants in here because you've got this wonderful forest Vista and then it almost brings it inside with all of the plants that you've got in here so it didn't start off with a lot of plants I was always a big fan of fake plants because I could never keep them alive oh and no but then it started with one plant and he survived his name was I think Henry or something and then it started growing and now Oliver jokes he's like I'm just gonna come home one day and it's just gonna be like a jungle and I'm gonna have to move out because there's too many plants that would be such a banner she asked me one day she's like is there is there such thing as too many parts and it was like I'm starting to think that there maybe is at this point it's nice I mean it definitely brings the greenery in but it's yeah it's getting to the point where a tiny house definitely has only you know a certain amount of window sills and things that that things can get cluttered on so this is very true I still AM personally on the side that there is no such thing as too many points okay he's on my team men okay well I'm also very much not a fan of fake plants so I'm glad that you've definitely replaced those with real ones and it is really lovely in here now tell me about the living room because this is really lovely and it seems to be quite clever what you've done with the office to the side and in the TV here as well yeah so we we know we wanted a good size couch we're pretty active people but we do really enjoy our movie nights when we first moved in we thought we wouldn't need a TV that we could just wash things in our laptop but we're big movie TV buff so we added the TV that is under the window and it swivels so I can turn it while I'm doing dishes and watch the same show or if I'm got somebody sitting on the couch and they want to watch it which is like super handy in the small space as well and then we have our desk unit which is it's not a lot of storage but it's just enough if I want to answer emails when I get home and do a little bit of work and store the computer underneath and it's just what I need I do like the way that you've built that with the little cubby for the laptop as well but it's being able to get that off of the table and keep it clear during the day is really nice when we first we're designing the tiny house the biggest thing as Oliver said you know we don't really have any room for a official dining area and I kind of pointed out that even when we were living in a big house the dining table wasn't also just used to put stuff on so we compromised it the little desk that yeah some stuff gets put on but it's only so big so you can't really put much on it we wanted to make the living room feel as spacious as possible obviously only being in such a small space we wanted that relaxation space at the end of the day to sort of kick your feet up and take it easy one of the things we did to make the living room feel bigger because it was quite small is we added the bay window feature which makes it feel bigger than it actually is by reaching out with the windows and then underneath is the outside access to our propane storage very clear though I like how you've done that and now tell me about the kitchen this definitely has a very country homes did feel to it totally this is our dream kitchen in a very small size which I think it's actually pretty big for a tiny house we went with quartz countertops and then we want the custom cabinetry soft clothes so it's it's super easy to use you just if you're not arguing and you're mad you still can't slam it great we won't miss your classic white hex on the backsplash again I just love the white on white it may be tough to clean sometimes but I just love the crisp bright look of it and then we went with a 20 inch propane range here as well easy to clean I love it so you can just remove the grills and get in there because honestly I'm a pretty messy cook so yeah I mean the range is perfect for a compact space like this for two people I mean unless we're doing some sort of crazy Christmas turkey dinner or whatever it should never happen is more than enough for two people to cook with and then obviously it's got a little tiny oven with a broiler on the bottom and it's it's a perfect size for this size of house we wanted the kitchen to feel like it was large with lots of counter space and ample prep area but sacrificing a little bit on on maybe the appliances we went for a 24 inch farm sink here we did a built-in range hood over top as well and it looks like you've also been able to build a lot of storage here into your stairs as well I can see the washer/dryer there you've got the full fridge and a couple extra drawers as well yeah so our dog owns this space here she has a little kennel she luckily gets to go to work with us every day so that's only for the odd time we have to put her in there and then she has like a full drawer to herself not gonna lie she also has a couple drawers in the kitchen but we won't get into that very yeah we tuck the washer/dryer combo under there as well as the fridge and then we just have an extra drawer on top there for things like laundry detergent an extra toilet paper it's nice to be able to utilize the stairs for basically all of the appliance storage and yes in in terms of the big stuff and then have some extra storage for things like pets or what have you absolutely and then it looks like you've got some extra storage bag they tucked away what's in there yeah so there's a door on either side and we have a his-and-hers closet which is a big deal for me I wanted room for some clothing and have it separate from each other so mine is on the right and it just gives you enough hanging room and you've got storage shelves too full clothing and then just enough room for your little laundry basket yeah it's nice to be able to have like serious said that separate area you know we see see some tiny homes where that space is sort of combined and that can be sort of the make-it-or-break-it factor when it comes to living together in a tiny house oh yes here's got her space I have my space sometimes my space is neat sometimes her spaces not so neat some leaves he has more clothing than I do I swear yeah yes I am not gonna pick sides on this and then behind all of that is the bathroom I'm guessing yes it's actually our favorite room of the house I think it turned out so spacious and bigger than I thought it would and I must say I had to go with the clown foot that is adorable it does look like a mini cast-iron tub yes so my biggest thing is I always want to clawfoot my whole life and I never got one so even though we're tiny I told Oliver we're still getting the clawfoot and it's like okay it's gonna be small but we'll make it happen I can take bubble baths in here no problem but are you actually yeah do you want me to demonstrate I think you have to yeah I'm gonna show you how it works  so this is me all right okay it's kind of a cross between a clawfoot tub and a Japanese everything Tom totally right Oliver just ends up taking showers in it it's just like a shower Basin and once you wrap the curtain around its fully enclosed which is nice have you ever tried taking a bath in that Oliver I have yeah there was about six inches in water at the bottom and it was overflowing it's a good use of water it's conservative you don't need much but you get in it kind of comes up nice and high that's definitely thinking on the bright side I like that then you've got the composting toilet here as well yes I was super hesitant about getting a compost toilet when we were designing the tiny house we'd stayed in a couple tiny ish homes with ones there were different units and they debt you definitely could notice some smell after a couple days but this one is totally worth it no smell and we just I couldn't imagine using anything else yeah for us the obviously the amount of water usage that a regular toilet uses it was a huge factor in in deciding to obviously go to the composting route we were blown away by the amount of water consumption that an actual you know a regular North American toilet uses as pretty substantial so when you calculate that out for a year with two people right it is a huge amount of water for really a time where we need to be taking a look at where our water is being used and literally flushing it down the toilet is not one of those ways and totally with you on that one good thinking on that and then your sleeping loft is upstairs yes can we take that out absolutely let's go check it out all right oh this is just so cozy I especially like how you've got the dual skylights up here yes it was very important to open up the space it is a little bit of a tighter loft so that's why we went with a window on each side as well as the skylights we love the windows on the sides because we can open the windows all the way and then at night you get just like this amazing cross breeze our biggest thing as we said with the skylights was it was you know we can watch the stars it but I swear every time we come up here and we're like okay let's look at the stars we ended just in a falling asleep like we don't actually ever get a chance to enjoy them or was too tired but the thought was there and another thing we did with the skylights was we did the solar shades so these closed and open which is great because I find if you if you have these skylights and the Sun is on the home it gets really toasty up here so it's really important to be able to close those definitely nice having that option and now what's this unit up here yeah so we just went with a plug-in a/c for us we don't use an AC enough to really justify like a built in unit so we just went with one that sits on the floor we don't use that corner space anyway it's doesn't really matter to us so it's just there when we need it so how long have you been living in the hood now we've been in the home for about two years now we haven't looked back since I mean it's been a pretty amazing experience for both of us just to be able to get back to the things that originally brought us together as a couple and and open up some more free time and to be able to enjoy the outdoors and and to be able to embrace you know where we live and what it has to offer I think the most common question we can ask now two years into tiny living is do you ever see yourself moving back into the big home and I I don't think so there's the only reason I'd go bigger would be maybe a little bit bigger of a tiny house in the future but other than that like just so happy with it yeah it's really simplified the way that we live and really we haven't sacrificed a whole lot to move from basically you know 2,500 square feet down to 225 so yeah this really gave us the opportunity for us to kind of go back to our roots and and establish what was important to us and it's been interesting though because before when we have the big house we worked opposite shifts I was a dance teacher and you were working landscaping so he was during the day I was during the night and we never saw each other so when we went tiny we went from never seeing each other to living in a tiny house and going to work the same job working together because we're on our business together so it went from like zero to 100 and we're still married so that's gotta be a good testimonial for it then right the tiny house in our life what it's brought to us is just a sense of kind of like relaxation and it's taken a bit of stress away when I home I'm excited when I get into the tiny also come in and I like take a deep breath and then it's home and when I go traveling I think about man I just want to get back to the tiny house no matter where we are so it must be pretty good home for us if yeah it's also brought for us it's brought a business I mean really at the end of the day we wouldn't have been able to to sustain the house that we were in and move into a new business venture so not only a tiny home business but it's also you know brought the opportunity of of having the financial freedom to be able to feel a little bit more confident moving into something like a business as young entrepreneurs that's the big challenges is they're still you know rent payments and mortgage payments and bills that are looming that that need to get paid and it's opened up the door for us to not dismiss those things but alleviate as much of those things as possible so that we can focus our attention on building the business and what was the budget for this tiny house we had sort of put out a budget at about seventy thousand that wasn't including any of our labor cost we probably hit more like eighty eighty five so we blew that budget a little bit but we were pretty confident in that money being well spent so things like the solar and and the finishes that we wanted on the house to really make it feel like home for us was really important so I think those numbers really made sense for us but I think at the end of the day it's money well spent for sure certainly being able to do all of the work yourselves will have saved a lot of money there and I think you can certainly see where the money has gone into this house there are very high-quality fittings and some really beautiful details that have gone into this so I completely agree with you money very well spent thank you appreciate it well I think you've done such a brilliant job with this home I love how you've taken some of those character elements of your past house and put them all into this one and I can see that this is a home which is really working absolutely beautifully for both of you thank you so much for sharing thanks guys appreciate it coming out thank you this tiny house really is just so beautiful and while they may not quite fit in this bathtub it's just filled with so many elements that really give it that feeling of home what I like most about this house though is the lifestyle that it's given to Oliver and Sarah this house has given them their weekends back the ability to venture into the outdoors doing things that they love and even start a new business and realistically there are very few home options that can do all of that for you [Music]  you", "1RVgLlrI4U4": "[Music]  living in a van allows me to work less but and have a lot more free time and not have to spend as much money on living expenses and I get to live by myself and have everything I want it and then I get to move my whole house anywhere I want to take it it was just all so super awesome originally why I got in the van dwelling or thought of it was I was a full-time transit bus driver and where I worked there was the bus depot and a bridge right next to it and there was all these bus drivers living in bands and motorhomes under the bridge and people would like make fun of them and call them like the trolls who have been in the bridge but I was like man these guys are so smart like they were making so much money and they're not spending any money on rent or mortgage and I thought oh yeah I'm gonna Google living in a van it took like a while for it to actually manifest my first band was a 1998 Chevy Astro man who was Donovan the Astro man had for three years lived in that full-time for two years but it was a bit small being able to stand it's really important even though like I do travel usually every year the fan I spend a lot of time living full-time in the city and going to work and the climate here is not that nice little year ifs it's really wet and rainy I want to have a place where I can hang out all day and not feel like cramped and claustrophobic I can pretty much walk around in here and like meditate in here and I could almost do yoga in here except they have in my hand stuff [Music] this is my 2016 Ford Transit it's a mid roof and it's the v6 engine with the 3.7 liter gasoline it's name is t-rex t-rex fan we built this bulkhead wall which is my super stealthy bulkhead my friend calls it the door to Narnia and then over here I have a sink and sink itself is made out of a stainless steel bowl from the dollar store that we cut a hole in if I press this button water comes out and  underneath here I have two six gallon water storage tanks in the back and the front one is the great tank that the sink drains into and then over here I've got more storage I've got two cupboards of storage all my stuff under there and two drawers this one's not finished yet the countertop is not finished yet it's been a year's worth of work but it's almost finished I'm gonna have a bamboo countertop and we're gonna be putting cabinets up here and I still have to finish all the wood and then I have a two burner drop in suburban stove and I have these great LED lights that just flip on an off switch and there's four more at the back and also have a roof vent fan up here I really wanted the closet this is my second ban and my first fan had very little storage and no closet which was kind of inconvenient so this one's got a big closet with mirrors and I have another drawer with clothes in there and that is the best thing in the whole van which is my suburban furnace um it's very hot and then I have the thermostat just installed over here on the side so I'm kind of spoiled when I'm cold I just flip it on and it's hot this is my table just on wheels and it rolls in out how big it is and under here is just more storage which is a little disorganized right now and under here is more storage which actually goes all the way to the back of the van and this weird door thing is actually made to store my sitar which is not in here right now I put this sunroof in because I don't have windows in here and I got a pretty good deal on the span there was six of them on the lot and none of them had windows in it so I wanted some light and windows in the back doors was really expensive and this was only like 400 bucks and I really like it because I have light and I can see sky is doing and I can see stars at night but no we can see in so that's pretty awesome the bed is just like a memory foam mattress a foam mattress it ended being a little bit thicker and cozier than I had sort of plan so it's a little tight I can sit up in there but it's not like a ton of room but I don't do a lot of sitting up in bed I mostly just like sit at my little table and then I have that little hyper vent stuff to keep air circulation under the mattress I have a second roof vent this one doesn't have a fan but I just thought with the tuber fence there's a bit of air circulation especially if I turn the fan on and have a smoke detector back there and I have a carbon monoxide LP detector on the floor and the idea behind covering every single thing up with wood and insulation is so that there's no condensation on the metal this climate mostly I live in Vancouver and it's very humid here and the condensation is a real issue so we're trying to avoid any kind of condensation problems I usually sleep in a diagonal and I sleep at whatever end my head is the highest so I move around in here I feel pretty safe in here I've heard like sketchy stories from other people and I had someone like creeped out my old van camped in cottonwood arizona they like I think it was a ghost but it's kind of a long story anyway when I woke up there was a handprint on the back of my van window but I still have jumped out in the middle of the night with flashlights running into the bushes looking for them that's kind of like I don't know my first thing is like I want to know what's happening like I'm coming to get you I don't know like I just I do have a really sharp machete in here so I have storage in the back in this back area quite a lot of storage  also these doors are cool because they open all the way up just nice and then underneath I have my bike and this is my playable kayak and all my biking stuff and I have a solar panel cuz I also have a gold zero in there just like a little one table chairs that kind of stuff and my battery is here and it's a hundred amp power AGM battery it gets charged using an solenoid it's a solenoid that's hooked up to the truck battery and the truck battery in the span is also an AGM battery so that works out as far as charging goes my dad put that in and he pretty much built almost the entire van with me doing a lot of standing around holding things so yeah I don't entirely know everything but I kind of do this is the table from the back we used tracks for a closet and then my dad made these little holders and wheels so that's how it slides out except I can't actually push it because it's locked in I'll show you this high prevent stuff from the other side actually it's a little piece it's like this plastic stuff it lets air flow under the mattress it's actually used in boats so I bought it at a marine supply store it's quite expensive but totally worth it and it definitely keeps the mattress from getting moldy or any kind of condensation under there but yeah I was recommended to me by another RV person and it works really good there's actually five inch thick pink fiberglass insulation in the main part of the wall and then anywhere where metal is gonna touch wood we tried to put the half inch blue foam in between the wood and the metal so we wouldn't get a heat transfer and then we put this vapor barrier in there the idea behind this foam is anywhere with the the ribs of the van all the way around are covered in this film so all the ribs that we screwed into are covered in foam and then the ceiling is 2 inches of the same blue foam insulation and floor is an inch of the same insulation Vancouver is really expensive and the rents are really expensive and I I've shared done some shared living in shared houses which is fine for like a little while but I'm pretty particular like about my living space and how I like to keep it I don't really like sharing space with people and I can't really afford to live in a place without sharing cuz the rent is so high here and I don't want to spend a lot of money on rent so this fan is my long-term plan now because I'm making payments on the van so I kind of have a mortgage but the idea behind building this van was I'm hoping to live in it for like the next 15 years at least this is sort of my long-term housing solution I don't have to work I don't work full-time I usually work like 25ish hours a week if I want to work more I can at my job is really flexible I try to work a little more save a little bit of money and then try to leave every winter because I don't really like the winners here so every winter I try to head down to the Robert Trent rendezvous in the Quartzsite Arizona so that started my long term plan is living in this van all year and going traveling to the desert for a couple months every year and then just coming back here and even with it [Music] so me and another van dweller we started a monthly van meetup in Vancouver for van dwellers on the first Sunday of every month at Spanish banks and everyone's welcome any vehicle any income level anybody you can just come and have a good time and yeah", "j6zQgrzqOLc": "", "HBDPRYjGZi4": "oh this is Patrick with New Jersey's outdoor adventures YouTube channel I'm here in a layer State Park in Farmingdale New Jersey and I just stumbled across this little camper van it's got foreign plates on it as a Volkswagen badging so I'm gonna go check this out so join me this is a Guido and where you from we are from Switzerland and we did a big trip from Argentina to Alaska and now we are here can you tell us a little bit about the vehicle you brought here yet we have a Volkswagen t5 chassis four-wheel drive diesel under 90 horsepower and the capping is custom made a small company in Germany built the cabin for us please take us to some of the features we have here yes we have a special dampers for approach and bias for offroad and we have these leading solar panels and 50 gallons fresh water ok and I see here these are pretty unique windows that we don't see too much but their dual pane it's like a lexan material yet double glass is from domestic cites windows remote most people me and is that a mosquito net that you just slide up and down you have the shade - yeah okay and what is this device over here this is the toilet  polite cos it  okay so I'm familiar with this type of system we use this here in pop ups you have yet fresh water for the toilet and  okay and you just take this out and bring it up to the dump station up there yeah okay and it's approximately five gallons you think yeah and there's an event yeah okay and then electric that's this okay so we're not familiar with this type of connection here I guess this is uh this is 250 volts yes so you're not able to plug in here converter no cotton burger from 210 to 203 so transformer mega yeah okay so you use a transformer and then I see this camp site doesn't have any hookups here so are you running off of the solar now yeah we can stay two weeks without power there's no problem we have a compressor fridge and two solar panels are enough for the compressor bridge and what do you has to meet the wattage of those panels to be like I think you told us earlier it had solar is it like a hundred watt or 200 watt system to weld o'clock 200 why and how many you on the twenty to twenty and how many batteries do you have three three batteries for the cabin and one for the engine and is it a six volt 12 volt or 24 volt 12 volt okay and there are the lithium ion or aged lithium wow you got some good stuff over there this is I guess the the exhaust for the Troma yes and that's a true MIDI zl-- yet fired furnace and that does your domestic hot water as well  wow this really has a lot of storage too you know and it's so well made I remember we imported through a company the Westphalia Germany yeah and the tooling and the precision everything was unbelievable yeah and you can see that here I'm just the way the compartment doors are put together it's got a double rib here and it's got yeah nice casket when we drive to the river we have no other in this tour \u00c3\u00a4j-- really I get one three feet deep deep in the water so you're telling me this vehicle you could cross a Via Cavour and these compartments are designed in such a way you can have up to three flood yeah without penetration so that mean you can't go about this no no this is the idea Wow and you've tested it before that is unbelievable and and the four-wheel drive is is it an all wheel drive er okay yeah we have a differential locking okay also and that the mileage is 25 miles per gallon excellent yeah that is unheard of here and this looks like it's 22 to 23 foot long and the height the height is impressive this is a s it looks like it's under nine foot eight yeah yeah ten foot mat nine foot yeah and you know because you put this in a shipping container yeah yeah okay and around back here it looks like we have a heavy-duty tire mounted one here bar one on the floor really yeah oh wow look at that and there's no rust no no what year is this vehicle how old 2014 okay so it's relatively new and above here we have a backup camera okay and what is this this is a licen polite yeah patio light yeah okay and what does that bracket do above the cameras that three bracket your zet so water doesn't come down no no no excess it really and then these are just extra fuel tanks the range is 800 miles Wow and then there's no storage here in the back whatever is fixed onto this yeah lumen extrusion and these are just bolted and clamped in place so you could you could switch this up it so so if you wanted one water jug and one fuel to container and bike okay and is it expensive to ship motorhome across South America to Argentina Hamburg to Argentina $4,500 okay and we go back to Europe from Halifax the coast $2,500 and with the recent spurt of RVs in the United States are you finding difficulty finding campgrounds and campsites no no we can Minnie no cam counts in a South American middle America you have no campgrounds and on the west coast you can stay everywhere it's not a problem here I know they give you a hard time but this vehicle you could Park this on the street and really no one would I don't think anybody would complain and the width is is got to be seven and a half foot yeah okay most RVs are 8 foot or a 1/2 foot here and what is this pipe do across the back it's a for Switzerland it's a protect a motorbike or a bike and crashed from from from the rear side really yeah so that's common there's so many motorbikes yeah that's some compression the back here and what does that do it prevents the bikes from sliding underneath yeah Wow and what this is storage this one porous set what's on the other side yeah inside that is tremendous amount of storage yeah and it's a lidded lidded compartment yeah you can see here the tooling and the wood yes it's not particle board it's all plywood cabinet grade and they do laminate on both sides so there's no exposed wood yeah that's something you don't see too much in domestic RVs one sides finished one side is bare plywood or particle board yeah and I see these brackets here what do they do this is especially if you can cook inside and outside so it's for an outside grill yeah we have here the table we can hang on the table even the table is is excellently I love the way they tooled that edge  now that is super cool on behalf also from pain and hot and cold water okay I'm familiar with this I've seen this same exact fitting on the Airstream this here is very nice this is made by Troma who made the the furnace but it's a neater way of hooking up propane but it looks like your fittings are a little bit different that's a quick disconnect yeah I like that it's a lot neater yeah and then this I'm familiar with I seen this on what Westphalia the same spelling of water but it's a lockable cap here for your pole water how many gallons do you think you have a 50 50 gallons by this table wow you know most of the tables that they have here any new yes they open the compartment here and it actually just clips on I like this because you can just a height in the angle then we have here propane cool beat Carlos okay so this is different than what we see here these would be maybe equivalent to a seven gallon or a 30 pound bottle by they have gauges on the side what's this refill the bottles from outside we have a Baptist or the whole world really yeah then that's suddenly you don't see  in the United States the propane tanks have to be permanently built-in and there's one connection this looks like we have here for filling yeah but I think these are two separate bottles and they're aluminum which is more resilient these are steel bottles here in the US and they usually start rusting after three to five years I really like this system he imagine trying to find the right adapter for all whatever country and you have and then you have a thule awning here yeah it looks like there's a 10-foot and it has buckles in the body yeah that you can buckle it in or you could do like what you did table yeah you could stake them into the ground and this is brilliant this is where he store your yeah they're not on the ground and that comes off I look at the hardware yeah that we have here this is excellent look at how thick the door is is very good dies of light and this is what keeps the door locked in place I usually do plastic here this is this is all stainless steel and then this is the snorkel this is all part of being able to cross the river you know you get your three foot of water here but you don't want to suck any water into the engine and intake so if I kick my shoes off can you give us a tour of the inside yep okay I know we didn't take a look this Tooley step is unbelievable electric here  Wow Airstream trailers have a little bit of step like that that's a manual step all the power steps that we see here yeah they're all metal and they rust yeah and they fade yeah this is great I love it so we have here a light menu go inside really nice switches - yeah even the steps which yep just a look of it  off here very spacious for a small motor yeah and they call it a motor home there are caravan or what's this call - camper van Disick temperament care for her okay so I'm familiar with the de Matic we we see these every day sing everything saying that this is a metal force a lot of RVs in the United States have plastic yeah and they break and this is a pretty thick stainless steel sink oh look at the latches here you can 40 pounds really yeah and these are full extension yeah so you know some drawers they only come out to here and you can't reach what's in the back these are full extension excellent all right what we got here you you are very efficient on how you pack it yeah we got a cutting board we got some olive oil all the towels and everything you need all stuffed away look at this little area here and how its utilized excellent we have different lights so this is a mosquito light blue light so they can't get attracted to it they're not going to come in and you can it's all LED for the position huh Wow and how many you know how many amps you think that takes very minimal menu yes okay led what we have going on up here yes this is uh how we monitor our battery our fresh water our wastewater this is the main battery kill switch water pump yeah this here is something you added in other words this delight automatically light from outside and you come here the light goes on so that's what that that word means that's emotionally okay or you can separate whole lights um hmm this is stainless steel yeah this is nicely done what is this this is just the light oh look how bright that is just have a little tiny light and look at the ceiling it's not fuzzy carpet material it's smart it's fiberglass just like that's good we have some storage at the top here hmm look at the engineering of these liftarms yeah premium cars anything they sit a good job as for offroad yeah you think you're rattling and shaking we throw off 20,000 miles off roads that be oh nothing fellow no okay and then this is your your rear dinette yes also oh these are clever here Wow and that's gonna keep this down and prevent it from rattling when you're driving yeah and these hinges they're really nice hinges and this is the mosquito net before when we came in I guess if you had a little dog maybe and then we have a 12 volt socket here yeah and then what's the tool on the plan D okay 220 and these are shades we're talking about so we have here shade mosquito net and then you could separate them and just have nothing hmm and do you have this glued down yeah yep yeah okay up top here I'm familiar with this style vent but it's the same you got a mosquito net and you get the shape yeah and that's manual so there's no rain sensor yeah okay and this material here on the cushions this is pretty tough stuff it's almost like burlap tough yeah yeah so this is our living room and our bathroom all on one yeah we can get the table down that took approximately maybe 20 pounds of pressure so it's something that anybody could be capable of doing and you lay a flat sheet on top of that yeah okay and it all packs away when it's time to get up yeah and over the top of the bed we have some reading lights speakers and this is us be so rail for a privacy curtain yeah yeah okay then you took that out yeah all right and who did the designs in the back a little design from us yeah touch and here's another one of those lights yeah and these are just amazing no plastic it's all yeah you know it is plastic material it's not thin plastic and I hear the Waco refrigerator this is a compressor driven refrigerator so this is not an absorption refrigerator and so what someone might say this is a small refrigerator but look we have two things of soda here another big container some mayonnaise eggs this is packed very efficiently how many days worth of food do you think this is uh four or five days okay and this is approximately two and a half cubic foot I would estimate and then below that storage this is the pantry stored look at this everything is perfectly put in and then I see here what a pump maybe see these are labels for some system has an access channel to get to yeah and then underneath the bed that's the storage compartment we saw on the back yeah all right now this is uh Wow now I wasn't expecting this bathroom to be that big this is about 28 inches deep this way yeah and then from the toilet to this container which is removable yeah you about another 28 inches this is a very large air and this is what they call a wet bath and this greeting here lifts up and then there's a drain plug in this is a stainless steel pan so that's not gonna rust out okay and then here's the toilet we saw outside the little cartridge but I guess you just push that little lever on the side now we'll give you a flush you have another one of those windows with the shades some storage up a lot above yeah look at that you don't like think do all the plenty wall right in the cabinet yeah so you don't get electrocuted by your favor and then this shower curtain this goes all the way around and this is gonna cover this whole area so you don't have to get everything wet and then look at the hardware here this is adjustable I guess you press this button you could slide it up and down yeah and then you have a nice metal handle here and a little velcro to keep this rattling when you drive yeah I'll Drive you nuts all right and then over to cab this is another very large storage compartment this goes all the way back in and this is clever look at these containers yeah these aren't gonna make noise when you drive it and although they're all lined with carpet hmm we can close here but visit the car over it's urgent then you can close the door that's it that's important it's Newfield yeah it's closed wow that is so it to prevent theft or does that prevent what people sneaking outside yeah okay  and then the flooring is a vinyl flooring and then the cab now we don't I'm not familiar with this Volkswagen vehicle here but there's no engine that stick yeah yes it's got a hood so you could get out of this seat while you're driving she could come back here and make lunch yeah right without trip yeah and this is a manual transmission this has six-speed transmission which you don't see here everything's automatic yeah and then there's your backup camera monitor and then seats I guess don't swivel because this is not part of the living space yeah Wow well I really appreciate you taking the time with me today to go through your vehicle this is by far one of the best engineered motorhome RVs I've seen in a while because everything looks the same here there's a lot of innovations we see from Europe yeah this is cool yeah is there any other things you want to share with us about this yeah if someone was to want to purchase one of these today yeah because there's a few years old what is the sticker price on something like this it's an expensive yeah like a hundred thousand or more on the 22 okay well that's common just motorhome like this yeah okay I was guessing two hundred thousand yeah just by the way everything was here yeah all right well excellent thank you very much well this is Patrick of New Jersey's outdoor adventures youtube channel I hope you enjoyed this vid please like this video comment share subscribe I love it I'll see you soon", "pQbRmMxQ0tY": "[Music] well I finish pressure washing the driveway and it looks great I just hope this sunken pad and the cracks can be repaired  matvey foundation repair is going to lift this sunken concrete driveway pad so it meets the level of the next pad that way we won't trip on it and it will last many years afterwards  [Music] Jack I put under this 12 ton jack easy to buy clothes [Music] without too much stress then we'll just lift it all the way up and fill it [Music]  is this typical the thickness of the pad um it's a little thin I think but it's pretty normal I mean a lot of slabs aren't more than three inches thick this looks a little bit under three inches to me [Music] so most driveways are like three inches but three to six inches is is what I use  well I guess so for lifting it's easier [Music] that's what I want to watch  [Music]  and then the rest of this little that's gotta come up a little bit more okay we'll just slip that that distance with the GU that was almost too easy Oh  raise that one broken section up here a little bit in process a special bit for this is carbide or diamond or is a diamond diamond that is a so expensive it's crazy I do not get them for myself my boss gets them  [Music]  [Music] oh this is the the goopy ins key you inject in there okay two to four feet I get it travel down a mole hole into interesting [Music]  so the goop they inject here is poisonous to mammals or anything chews it up which in our case would be good we'd love to get rid of the moles that way  [Music]  so I usually start injection about 90 degrees and then it'll continue to heat up to a hundred 105 it makes and now or does it as it's injected it's mixed with as as it's injected the two different materials come through two hoses and in the gun they're mixed together and then they react thank you one of them expands and the other one hardens  these little orange things are disposable like this one will probably be used for most of these I might use another one if we used to have ones that were bigger and you tap them in like a nail each one of these would have an individual one and those would last her  Part A and B are going into simultaneous simultaneously and I'll start to feel this lift will be able to tell when this is no longer when it's this loose yeah and my guess is we've created an enough space that it'll probably come out the side [Music]  Wow you can I cut it off with the saws I brush it down [Music] and I'll do a four more injections  make sure it's a hold after I take it off [Music]  how far that's a spread yeah I can see all the way to the other pad second pad whoops  [Music]  so we can park our RV on this when this is all done yep yep yep give it like 20-30 minutes and you should be bye hope coming up it's almost too much  we already you know yeah that looks pretty good this is basically filling and the way we can tell us when I pulled this back out the foam should come right back up through the top and it's bull can you feel a little bit of back pressure as you yeah a little bit you get the idea I do you put a little too much in that allure yeah there's the art to this too  all feel feel it with your hands  but then another thing you do is tap on this get this to go down a little bit a lot of the time the little rock in it is pushing creating friction so that it won't actually go down unless you give it  usually I get a either a hammer a rubber hammer or I get my my partner with a pry bar and a piece of wood tapping on it and it'll go right down well it doesn't actually go down this this allows this to come up then right and but it is up  [Music]  that means it can lift it just slightly oh there we go yeah as you see if it's alive the diffuser this are bad when you're in the closed space this one I'm not gonna inject it's already up against here I don't want to delicious all  I'll leave that one alone do you think it has sunken since it was poured it relative to the garage yeah this is definitely sunk but I think it's something okay it wasn't that much it was only like what three quarters of an inch maybe but for 40 years that's pretty good right now very slowly but it is lifting and rather than lift it and create an edge there I'm just gonna stop  a lot of space under this near the garage okay which also adds to my theory that things just 70 this was probably uptight against here  yeah so that's probably about how much it's um  so we've been around up here for 10-12 years  [Music] he started out I think with like 10 employees and we're at 70 now  our two most common things are the first one is water damage that is the most common but after that it is new construction or old construction where the soil was not compacted well based on the way the slab behaves and based on the way it's cracked no rebar ochio rebar most most people do not have rebar surprisingly but it is incredible how much strength it adds to your to your slab it's kind of odd because this is cracked here and this is almost too high and is this is almost too low it's like oh I'm gonna cut the difference between the two this stuff goes out as you could see over there how far it goes out and it'll go up inside this crack and almost act like a glue there it is right there you get the idea right on cue almost like the Elizabeth to me these bubbles indicate water yeah so there's probably that empty space is full of a little bit of water after the rain which over time that would erode this out more and more but with this it now there's no space for the water to sit in there and this will not wash away with the water a little bit of lifting of the second pad here so soup is doing the lifting ball on here [Music] and what do you think I can lift him or sir this is kind of up to you if you want  now I'd say it looks pretty good to me yeah okay that's fine like here I'm gonna lift this just the tiniest bit  and it'll probably make this pretty darn evening all right that's the fault it's a little hard to tell on the video but what a huge difference I'll be able to fill in those cracks now with some good quality and add some sand to it to make it match as close as possible to concrete next step is to clean up the material it squirted out in the places [Music]  you knocking down some of the sharp edges this material will turn yellow over time from UV light but you can brush it up with a wire brush or use brake cleaner  [Music]  he's picking up Christmas oil back under the area here he lifts it up okay brake cleaner yeah it's a great cleaner okay we found you can use any but we like Oh Riley's best so okay just a little bit of concrete dust I sifted it out with the calendar just regular high strength concrete okay you just fill the whole  fine whatever size of rock you want this is pretty small here so I'll have to use like that and then just sprinkle it on there down and then I usually do just a tap a wander over it as it helps blend it in a little bit as you can see [Music]  I was told to let it dry for a day before washing off that little bit of residue that way the patches will have a chance to get nice and hard where does dry weather I will the cracks", "KRWOR8ryTYY": "hi this is Janet Jan tastic studios and I'm going to show you today how to iron a nap paper napkin onto a surface like a Christmas card now the napkins are like three ply so I've just pulled off one fly and it looks like it's ready to glue but it's not you've got to get that second layer off and it's and it's really difficult to get it to separate but once you figure out how to get it separated like get a corner work flues it's not too bad but it's just getting that finding that little edge that will release the paper and as you see I'm not having much luck here  finding a corner sometimes ironing it a bit will help it separate  I think it's kind of important to see these things because I don't want you get frustrated when you try it because you can't get it to work instantaneously there it goes okay so and as I said it'll look on the package of the McNabb khun's and it'll tell you how many ply it is that way you know how many pieces you have to take apart so there's the two plies over there and here's my third ply right here which is where the artwork is now your saran wrap has to be larger than the area one of the reasons why is the saran wrap will shrink as it heats like shrink wrap so I want to place this I want some of this really pretty border here and I'm gonna place this right at the top edge of my Christmas card and I want that I do want I do want a bit of that ribbon in there so I'm going to move this over as much of that ribbon as I can get and still get a border the bottom of the carve the tree goes past the bottom of the card but that's okay it's just going to have to have to be that way because that's the size of the card I'm using but I've got the idea and what I want in there I'm aligning it again to the top of the card to make sure everything is aligned correctly then you place a piece of paper now I tried a heavier card stock at one point thinking oh I'll do that because it'll be easier to pick up and down no the heat there's not enough heat going through the card stock to work so you need to use just like typing paper deal where you're gonna probably scorch it so this piece of paper is gonna go away now this is laying on top we're done of the saran wrap is peeking out from underneath the paper so I'm not gonna get the saran wrap on my iron of course you should use an iron that's for crafting right like we all have nine irons laying around not so I just use my regular iron as you can see by the scratches on the surface of the iron it's done other things besides iron closed in fact I very rarely iron closed ever so now I've got it on the high setting and dry you don't want steam you want dry and then you're just going to apply the heat from the iron onto the card how much heat well that's kind of iffy depending on the iron and depending on the paper and the surface you're using you want to just get it as hot as you can without burning it basically and like I said you'll probably scorch it eventually because you're going to want to get enough stick them from the saran wrap to get all the edges sealed so now my iron has done the flashing thing where you've had your iron down to long duct and so I have to lift it up to put it back down again I want to make sure I get these corners done really really good so that I have all the glue I need under these corners again holding the iron down as long as I I can hear that no you can't but I can you see it squirts right there but I could I can hear the plastic crinkling underneath it now now you see I got scorch marks there okay so now we're gonna do our first check and you also can smell just a bit of it okay so see okay that didn't stick down there you can see it coming up with it lift it from this side okay now you see how the edge is coming up just a little bit there it's coming up there it's not coming up there it's coming up there so I need to get those three corners done give it a little more heat  trying to get those corner edges just really sealed tight it's not a perfect dart it's not like is if you're using Elmer's glue the only problem with using Elmer's glue or glue to stick this down you end up with a really hard surface that looks like that stuck that looks like that stuck that stuck that stuck okay turn the iron off and then the next thing is you're going to trim around the edges now when I did the envelope which you sell I'm sure you saw my facebook page when I did the envelope I did the whole envelope with the look with the flat closed then I went back with an exacto knife blade and  cut the slit where the flap met the card and it worked perfectly absolutely perfectly okay so now I'm going to let's see if it worked I got a little bit of an edge there  let's see if I can peel it off up from over here there we go and when I  trim the top edge of my car after the plastic this is the melted saran wrap basically you're getting off of there and I saw where this edge is see it's coming up just a tad so I'm going to lay the paper back down over here and even though the iron's off it's still got enough heat probably to seal that little edge there can I think it's important for you to see that not everything there you go now the edge is sealed it's important to see that not everything is perfect and it doesn't always work perfect every dime you've got to work with it and play with it nobody's perfect okay so okay now you see the card is bent up a bit you can just make sure all the Saran wraps off then really irritates me when cards don't fold correctly so make sure your card is folded correctly and then you can take that still warm iron iron the fold kind of like a bone folder and then kind of hold it down a little bit while it cools once it cools there's your card now is that gorgeous or what awesome thanks for watching", "n7G7p1MPWlM": "I'm Jenna and this is my hundred and sixty-five square foot tiny house. There are plenty of videos on YouTube that talk about all of the positive aspects of living tiny. Downsizing and simplifying your life, freeing up your finances, less chemicals in your house, mobility, Eco friendly. This video is not like that. I'm gonna get real with you. This video is not going to be about why it's so fantastic to live tiny. I'm not going to showcase those instagram-worthy photos. Well, okay, maybe a few *music* I'm gonna talk about the hardships of living tiny. The realities and why it's sometimes stinks. Literally and figuratively. So these are my 10 pet peeves/least favorite things about living small. I really wish there was a video like this before I decided to downsize so that I knew what I was getting myself into *music* First up: Everybody always talks about how easy it is to clean a tiny house. and that's true it takes 20 minutes to clean a tiny house. It's small. But you know, what else doesn't take much time? Getting it dirty. My house is the same size as a lot of people's entryway. Do you see an entryway in my tiny house? No, there's the door and boom. You're inside. Let's say I just got done snowboarding. I'm trekking in snow. If I just got done on a hike, I'm tracking in mud. And yeah, I have a little porch that I could dust myself off, but when it's raining or super cold outside I mean who's really gonna spend the time to get themselves completely clean before stepping inside their house? That just doesn't happen So it's really easy to get your house dirty when you live in a small space. Especially when you live with a dog and my dog is very hairy. So I am sweeping this house constantly trying to get all of the hair off of my clothes, out of all the little crevices. I am constantly cleaning. Number two: Adequately named, it's actually about my composting toilet. Not everybody has a composting toilet in their tiny house So this is really particular to mine. I love my composting toilet. Don't get me wrong I've talked about it plenty of times but one of the downsides Is that it's not easy for people to learn how to use it right away It's not like you just come in and know how to use a composting toilet. You have to read the directions. And yes, I do have directions on how to use my composting toilet with pictures But the reality is not everybody wants to read before using the bathroom. They just want to go in and they want to do their business and they want to be done. So when I have guests over I have to explain how to use the toilet. What's the last thing you want to do at a dinner party? Discuss toilet matters. The first time I had my boyfriend over, I had to inform him that he needed to sit to pee to use my toilet. That's not a great icebreaker for a new relationship. But hey, he stuck around so I guess he passed the test. (3) One of my least favorite things to do in my tiny house is make the bed. Especially after washing the sheets and I have to do the whole thing where you put the fitted sheet on the bed I mean, I'm in a loft so it's a very confined space. I kind of feel like I'm doing acrobatics, barrel rolls over myself to try to get the sheets on the bed the correct way. It is a whole ordeal, but I really like a made bed in my house. So I do it every single day. Once it's done you're like: *I did that* Number four is smells. I'm not talking about the toilet. I'm talking about when you're cooking in a tiny house, or when you put on too much perfume in a tiny house, or when your dog smells like wet dog in a tiny house. The smells will get on your clothes and it is difficult to get it out and you can't escape them because you are in 165 square feet with that smell. Sometimes living in a tiny house literally stinks. Everybody always says, \"Oh you can\\'t have guests over.\" I can have four or five people over for dinner. \"Semi\"-comfortably at my little table, but that\\'s about it. Forget about game night in a tiny house. You do not have space for that. Also inviting guests over to stay. I have a futon mattress that folds out. We're all kind of in the same area and we're sharing one bathroom that I have to explain. Another downside of living in a tiny house is that there's no room to grow. You are literally restricted by your trailer. So if you decide: \"Oh, you know what I\\'d really like to expand.\" \"I\\'d like to have another bedroom in my house.\" You would have to redesign the whole layout and you're not really gaining any more space. You're just redoing the layout and that works to some extent but it also has its limitations. I think that's why a lot of people use tiny houses as an in-between house. When they're kind of looking for what the next step is in life and then eventually when they do need to grow. They kind of have to move out of their tiny house and upgrade to something slightly bigger. The next downside of a tiny house is that you're not just limited by the size of the trailer. But you're also limited by the weight. You can only put so much weight on those axles. So, you know when I'm looking at cast-iron pans I'm thinking about the weight of the cast-iron pan before I'm buying it. When I'm looking at sink choices I'm thinking about the porcelain versus a stainless steel and how much that weighs and I'm constantly thinking about weight when it comes to my house. In a regular house, you don't have to think about any of that. If you like porcelain, you go with porcelain. If you like marble and you can afford It you go with it. This is probably not a shocker, but there is a limited amount of closet space in a tiny house. This is my closet. All the space I have for clothes. I've been in friends weddings since living in this tiny house and so I have to buy high heels, I have to buy the bridesmaids dress and then I have to immediately get rid of it afterwards. Why? Because I don't have space in my closet to keep a dress that I maybe will wear once or twice again or maybe never. Sometimes you have this occasion like New Year\\'s Eve and \"We\\'re going to Vegas!\" and you\\'re like \"Wow, okay.\" \"Well I guess I\\'ll wear the same thing that I wore to Molly\\'s wedding last week.\" Because I only have one dress-up outfit and that could be kind of depressing sometimes. There are some challenging legalities to living in a tiny house and I'm sure you've all heard it before. But it has to do with parking and it has to do with  insurance. Sometimes you just can't find that perfect parking space, You can't buy land legally and park your tiny house on it in that specific place that you want to park. Finding insurance can be difficult as well. I've written articles about finding parking and finding insurance for tiny houses and you can find links to those in the description. but I will say it can be a real bummer. And last but not least: Other people will judge you. Some are you are judging me right now. Don't lie. You're doing it You're judging me right now. And you know what? It's something I've learned to live with. It's not a big deal. Some people get it and some people don't and that's okay. We're not all the same. If you're gonna be different, if you're gonna live alternatively, you best be prepared for some scrutiny. Hope you guys enjoyed this week's video. I didn't sugarcoat anything for you. This is the reality of living small. There are of course downsides to it. Until next time. See you later.", "8B6xR3T37gI": "the only reason I'm going to bring some shoes is because we've got the first part of this we've got to go through some semi rough country we're going to take you up to the original 50 and $500 house first and then we'll see the spectacular one so this is all your land up in here yeah it's a quarter of a mile by a quarter of a mile so you came out here looking for a place to build you know to buy yep you want to build your own place yep and did you know you're gonna go underground um no I didn't at first this is kind of a wild bear area this land this county here is two-thirds National Forest well my house my original house is right up there about 50 yards now this this little one that your daughter's buy that house cost $15 to build when I was in grammar school I was drawing plans for homesteads the reason I went underground was I was freezing in this little shack and it wasn't worth insulating I tried to figure what could I build that would be quick easy cheap and warm above all I guess that's a mushroom I thought maybe it was their scat bear scat is black like that and we've had our share of bears up here yeah reminds the Bears of it too unfortunately this is a 500 dollar house we dug this by hand and built the whole thing in in three months here in the northwest we don't have any Sun in the wintertime you know but I could still get just enough light to write by and to read by oh yeah sure I lived in this for over 30 years your eyes will get adjusted here pretty quick you still get a lot of light oh yeah that's that's the uphill patio and now remember the the Sun is going to go down pretty soon so we're not getting as much light as we could in here this cost only $500 but how much time I mean a lot of digging or yeah we dug dug everything by hand and now the lumber that we used in the original house was all from thrown-away lumber from the mills that's how I could build a place for $50 you know this over here is kind of an invention of mine I call this the barbecue windows the barbecue windows you can stand inside in hot weather and you're cool because you're in here you can stand in here in cold weather and stay warm because you're in here and you can cook outside and the smoke goes up that's the fire area right here yeah yeah sure we you know I had a great over it and but you don't worry about burning down your house no no underground houses do not do not burn very well so that's that's a nice thing and this has always been my bed area here and there I called the use of fire windows because I used to have campfires out there at night you see that polyethylene that's where the last bear who got in came in through one night I heard a bear out there I guess I want to open that window and something was stopping it from opening the bear had been out there that closed only this section in here was in the original 50/50 dollar house I turned it into my palatial 500 dollar house you tell me a little bit more about why you went underground well because I was freezing above ground and the reason I write about it and prophesize on it is because there are great advantages of going underground it's warm in the winter it's cool in the summer you use half the building materials you by yourself with hand tools there's less taxes the guy comes around to assess your house you say what for this hole in the ground you know it's aesthetically pleasing can be built by anyone you can camouflage it so it can't be found it's defensible it takes up none of the Earth's growing surface there's just any number of advantages to going underground why haven't we done it then why haven't we done it more on a mass scale that is a wonderful question and that's that's where I come in they haven't done it because they haven't figured out how to get windows into the places in in abundance and we figured that out I've always seen basement windows all my life I was originally going to put a basement window on the uphill side and then I thought well if I'm going to put a basement window in there why not bring it down also you know start stacking windows down on it and then I thought if I'm going to stack windows like that on the uphill side why not go out a little also and plant a garden out there so that's that's how the uphill patio came about I mean for example all of these windows here on the uphill side our windows that the normal builders and architects have never conceived of they built the first thought house they in a hillside like this they build a house like this with all the windows on the south side and they have very few if any windows at all on the rest of the house around the rest of the house so it has no balance of light and you knew you need a balance of light in a house you need windows from these two sides in every room that matters that one that you're shooting now is totally underground and unfortunately it's soon to go into the ground because it's a for 35 years now I've never done anything with it and any house that you leave go for 35 years goes pretty fast I was building this for other people when I started writing heavy again so I let it go but there was an ambitious little house in a pinch it would have slipped 17 people in here and I can't guarantee a second to collapse on us  the first plans had this idea of going underground on a hillside and having a big bunch of South windows on it that is what I call the first slot house and it's a disaster that's what everybody builds when they build underground houses these days and they shouldn't be one of the advances that I made is when I build an underground house on a hill like this I cut out the upper part make what I call an uphill patio and that gives us lots of light from the upper side in the course if you plant that it's beautiful it's wonderful but what I want to show you as a shelter house that we we don't have completed but if times get really rough I'm sure I'll have plenty of volunteers up here to complete it yeah it's the shelter s nuclear attack forest fire earth changes riots whatever what have you since its underground if we if we don't have a stove in here but we've got a lot of people in here the body temperature will will keep this livable  yeah it is it this roof ilysm at the level of the ground good idea that this is something can be replicable anywhere in the country sure and if you build it yourself it can be very inexpensive these guys he can pull off the land your posts and beams and girders and so the lumber might be maybe $300 we dug all this by hand by the way this and the other house in there so we can you juggle by hand shovels yeah I don't know how long it took us to dig wait I don't like digging much more than three hours a day but I do like digging up to three hours a day marvelous exercise you can see your progress you know as you're going good with mattock work it digging is fun within reason well we can start moving down we got a lot more to see Hey for two years before I moved up here I was a labor labor foreman wherever the machines couldn't dig we I saw that houses could actually be built you know how do you rotate with your bills how do you find a good spot by instinct by sleeping out on the site for a while when I was building for other people I would go up and I would sleep out on the site for a couple of nights get the feel of the place so you don't look for a certain type of dirt or a solidity to the dirt or something for building I would and in fact we're in about the prime building underground building area I've ever found  it's silt and sand and a bit of clay the walls stand up when you when you dig either by hand or with a machine they stand up and hold their shape and there's no rock here which is really nice when you're hand digging you just love to be a bare foot now all my life really yep so for you back to the land is quite literal yeah yeah yeah  would you consider yourself part of the back to land movement oh absolutely I was in the first wave of the hippie back-to-the-landers in 68 probably 10,000 hippies left the San Francisco area in the month of May I was one of that 10,000 we were biting off more than we could chew but what we could chew was wonderful  this looks like a traditional house this is from this side ah you want from the other sides what an underground house is not an underground house is nowhere in common with the basement then a penthouse apartment has in common with a hot dark dusty attic you walk into this house from ground level and you take a few steps in and you're suddenly 12 feet underground beneath the surface rather we're 12 feet beneath the surface here we're 6 feet beneath the surface over there we would be somewhere between 12 and 6 feet beneath the surface on the south side and on the north side but we've excavated for four windows and for air and light and so forth you know at this point the earth was a little more than six feet deep here six feet deep at the end of that so is probably 8 or 10 feet deep here yes it doesn't feel underground no it's not technically underground it's a this is an earth integrated house we're working with the earth you know take it out if you want windows and doors this is one of our least completed rooms this is a bunk room and the upper bunks got good window the lower bunk we're going to get a two-foot-wide culvert and we're going to dig out a trench in the solid earth here and then back fell over it so the kid lying in bed there can still see Canada even though he's a solid earth between him and Canada this would be the bathroom we got some of the plumbing in but we don't have any water supply up here yet so we're not in any hurry to finish the bathroom this is called the cooks room it's the best bedroom in the house they get the best bed best mattress so you're insulating oh yeah we're above ground at this at this point but we're not insulating on these walls because it's Ella ders behind there this could be done in any limit sure matter each the temperatures of the climate up to any extreme degrees so if you live in a really hot climate or a really cool climate its work even better in really Hut and really cold climates and eight foot down the earth stays at the yearly mean temperature where that climate here it stays about 52 degrees an earth integrated house we're working with the earth we're not overwhelmed by the earth we don't overwhelm the earth we're working with her with the mother the heat from your house in the wintertime it's not escaping out into the atmosphere it's heating the outside of your house they and it still keeps eating in the outside of your house it retains that heat and the same thing on the cooling it's cooling your house in the summertime we're on a ridge at this point the ridge is fairly levels we cut through the ridge so we got lots of light from the south and lots of views from the north and good light from the north too  normally I wouldn't I wouldn't use this this is a little atrium type thing here but I needed windows in there and needed windows here and I needed windows there so I built a little atrium one of the designs underground designs that I've developed here is you see how this part of the roof slants back before it comes down like this normally the roof is slanting like this but up here it's got an additional slant like this so that raises it above the normal pitch of the roof and that allows us to put windows in there and then all along that side and I call that a Sun scoop and as far as I know it's the first one ever built we want a house that's got windows on all four sides even though it's earth integrated and my all my other houses even if they're totally underground they still have windows on all four sides not everywhere in all four sides but they have windows on all four sides so we have light coming into a room from two directions in every room and that's really really really important it's funny because inside it doesn't feel like it's underground but outside it actually looks underground 50 percent underground yeah it looks like it just has to so is it just because you've chosen the opening so carefully well yeah sure sure there's there's one room here that's totally underground that's on the other on the other side of those other side of those windows we call that the cool room it's kind of like a mini root cellar we got three-foot earth on that roof that would do us in case of atomic attack  that's the cool room yep yeah it's like it's like a root cellar in inside the house we've actually got a deep freeze that can go in there it runs off at 12 volts  so really feels by conventional this feels a conventional living room to an extent it doesn't feel you know underground is it feel no but at the buoy are underground you know this is all earth on the roof fact we are super Earth integrated the walls are filled with earth in this house and that does a number of things it cuts the radiation if we're come to that to make the place fire resistant it helps insulate between the rooms it's dirt cheap so you're also probably saving on some insulation and oh sure oh sure my type of construction it does give support you have a beam here and a beam here and if you got earth behind it and you put a girder or something across there then the pressure from this side is counterbalanced by the pressure from that side you know so it becomes a very stable structure so you feel that anybody could do this it just is it like post-and-beam or is it a different idea no it's called PSP post sure and polyethylene system a post second to the ground we've treated or protecting it the wood from the earth nowadays I'm protecting them by charring them first of all which will double the lifespan of a post on the ground that's a post shoring as lumber out here you're going to have to have at least 2 inch lumber and most hillsides and your post should probably be not more than 6 feet apart and then you put a layer of polyethylene wrap the the lumber with a layer of polyethylene and you've got an extremely low-cost house extremely fire resistant radiation resistant wind resistant and it's going to heat you in the winter time and it's going to cool you in the summertime ok this is my own apartment here that's the kitchen area that's the dining table there and this is my work table where I'll be doing when we're writing ok though we're on the on the second floor at this level here we're approximately lower close to 3 foot below surface at this level here in this part of the house over here we're totally below the surface although it's a that's only it's only another 3 feet or so itself there something like this might be working visiting 2 people because it does look more conventional that they should integrate with the earth yeah I'm hoping so this is only 1,800 square feet we're bringing it in for probably one-tenth the cost of construction down in California or someplace like that you know all these structural members were off the land so it didn't cost me anything other than building it of the structural members in the cross supports here maybe they were off land the these two windows were salvaged and so they were only a couple of bucks each the challenges to come up with a integrated plan where you can put used used windows into a into a room and have a pattern that's pleasing to the eye I buy a lot of used windows and I number each window and I measure each window and I'll cut out little scale window models and I'll sit down and I'll you know you know I'll play with these things for a couple of nights and I come up with you know I like I like that I like those guys over there in particular my favorite this was this was kind of a tough one to come up with but I like it too the only window that I had to pay any real money for was that little gap there that angle guy I probably got these two big windows here for probably the two of them for 10 bucks I thought I was going to be able to pull this in for $15,000 as it turns out it's going to be probably 40,000 because can't do the labor myself anymore you based your ideas at all in untraditional designs I know there's a lot of traditional cultures that have gone underground Native Americans six example yeah Native Americans went underground from the Dakotas they had great big underground places with Don Wilson went whole to eliminate the smoke and let in light down to the southwest where they went three foot underground and then then arch natural vegetation over it  you'll find various cultures who have gone underground I am totally absolutely irrevocably convinced that we are living in Industrial Age we are the ones who are living in poverty not the indigenous people of this world this was a $50 an up underground house book and it's been pretty much supporting me since 78 when I brought it out this is the house we were in earlier today that's that's the five hundred dollar house here's the first thought design you get Windows from only one side generally in a house like this which is terrible light you get all your drainage going back into the hillside and all your drainage coming down into the hillside and it's going to back up against this back wall I don't care what you do sooner or later that back wall is going to leak you have no cross ventilation in there you have no egress out the back it's a terrible thought house instead we turn it around like this we put in uphill patio there and all the moisture is coming down the hill absorbs into the ground before it reaches the house and if it is on a north slope you get a tremendous amount of light in there if it's on a south slope then you're going to put in Gables going to put in Royer fires you're going to put in Hollywood wings you're going to put in Sun scoops so there's no reason whatsoever to build an underground house that doesn't have all the windows you could possibly want in there this is the house we built for a client everything it was that was exposed to the atmosphere was windows or doors this was a 5,000 square-foot underground house with a greenhouse built in the early 1980s for $20,000 here was an underground house built in Holland the authorities came out and said hunts we understand you have been building illegally here and Hunt said take a look around man you know it's um I'm busy you'll have to look around yourself and they walked around this house and didn't see it the advantages of building an underground house especially with our method there's less tax to pay on it it's warm in the winter it's cool in the summer  it's a fallout shelter it cuts atmospheric radiation it's defensible its concealable it's relatively fireproof no foundation is needed less other building material your pipes should never freeze they're weatherproof I can't believe people build houses in tornado and hurricane country if they went underground they're prettier down weather proof less maintenance on the places can be built by just about anyone they're pretty soundproof and because you're not taking up any or growing service you have increased yard space most aesthetically pleasing because you're working with nature so well and the reason people haven't gone underground because they haven't figured out yet how to get windows in the place and that's what we've done here in Idaho we figured that out for them  you", "cSDsP9JMs-g": "hello everyone welcome back to my next video today we're going to meet Carolyn actually we met Carolyn in my last video or we did the interview and now we're going to take the tour inside her van say hi Carolyn hello again everyone and so again let's just briefly say how did you end up here in the middle of nowhere living in a van well basically my marriage ended last year and I got enough in the settlement to be able to buy a half a house which I didn't want so I ended up buying the van instead and what is this which granted you end up with this is a Dodge Ram Promaster 2500 159 wheelbase high top and what yours it 2017 so it's really new right now right off the lot and so did you do the conversion yourself I'm working on it at first I did not think I would do that I talked to a pit or I was just planning I was going to pay someone to fix my van but after talking to them all and going to the RTR I had a change of heart and decided I'm gonna do it myself even though I don't have any idea of how to do it I'm just going to learn and are you adopted a philosophy of how you were going to do the initial conversion and what was that that I don't know where I want everything to be and I didn't know when I was starting out so I didn't want to build anything permanently so I did a temporary build all of this can come down when I get my solar and I have to run the wiring and all that but I'd rather have it temporary for a while to see how I like it I can still move this over here and that over there to see where everything wants to live and how it works best for me and have that worked so far oh yeah when I first started I had a camping cot and I put it in the back everybody puts their beds in the back so I thought that's where it had to go but I didn't like that I also found having the two dogs in here I had them in kennels at first soft sided kennels that they could just go in and out and it took too much of my floor space I couldn't move without tripping over a dog or a dog Kevin so I when I built the bed I built it with me on the top and them on the bottom well while I was on side and take a look alright so the first thing that stands out is the insulation the reflectix on the walls you thought it was pretty important to insulate some people debate it well since I started this in the winter on the East Coast and it was a freezing winter on the East Coast I learned very quickly the importance of insulation so I went back to where I could work and I got the insulation my son helped me I've got the 1 inch foam boards the poly iso insulation in every recess around the van and on the floor and then I covered it over with the roles of reflectix and do you mind uh the silver showing is not an issue I think eventually I would like a wall you know bowing probably out like a melamine all finish or even a cloth I'm not big into putting two tons of wood in here because you have to pay for the gas to drive that all around you found you started out in the winter and you found the vehicle to be too cold and that's what compelled you to first things first get insulation right and as it made much difference oh yeah yeah it's still I still work on temperature issues in here now that it's summertime of course it's very hot right and I'm kind of all closed in here with foil and with the dogs I can't keep the doors open so I don't have a fan yet so it does get pretty hot right here and so what were you using for heat I mean if you're here in the winter and it could be really cold on these coals yeah I have I did get a mr. heater buddy the medium sized one and that's that's good but without the fan being insulated you turn it on it warms things up you go back to bed and a half an hour later it's freezing again like because the heat just leaked so once I did the insulation I find the heat stays in obviously and I know what you did with the reflectix over the doors was really brilliant can you show us here and back I sure didn't busy in the back I I wanted a way to be able to put the reflective down without permanently attaching it to the door both here and on the sliding doors so what I've done is this is just a roll that's cut to fit here and tie it up and when I want to put it down it will roll all the way to the floor when I move that we met Hall and it's just held up here with spring clips oh man that is such a brilliant idea I don't believe I've seen that done before exactly that way I built this bed my son helped with some of the power tool issues I had this fencing for their dogs backyard fence this is all two by three four boards that we just screwed together there's melamine on the bottom because the dog hair kind of accumulates underneath the mattress here right well I put melamine down in there to make it easier to sweep out and then there's a some birch plywood for the top of the bed and the best is all just the two by threes and I had a queen-size mattress from my house nice therm-a-rest mattress that obviously I couldn't fit in here so I cut it in half and the top half became mine the bottom half became theirs I'm very comfortable on here it's a really comfortable bed I sleep very well well this is a bag I haven't quite figured out where to put yet this has winter clothes and an old blanket which I needed to survive the winter these are more dog blankets and then I have two of these Walmart every drawer long ones and I have two of the Walmart shorter one and I just keep clothing in here and then this is my clothing allotment if I bring more in I have to take something out so all your clothes fit and all my clothes fit in these three drawers except for the winter coat so this one I have all my dog gear in the top and then assorted tools and tape and rope and tie down and then here is my camping of my propane my butane firestarters things for outdoor over here is all my food so it's convenient to the table you'll probably notice the lack of meat and dairy I'm vegan so I don't need refrigeration so far I keep fruits and vegetables up here and then down here I've got sauces beans and my quinoa dried beans things like that in there all right well what most vegans eat a lot of produce fresh produce and that that's helpful to have refrigeration it can be yeah what I've been doing is just buying a couple days worth at a time I found this boy clearance at Walmart and of course if you said anything on here it's just going to go flying around so I drill a couple of holes in it and tied it with paracord there's a handle back here just the table handle to keep it from falling around I took some of the lighter things and I have these bags a lingerie wash bag or I'm very useful I just use some  not these at Walmart and they have rings attached to them I take the Rings off and feed them through the boards that are just held with zip ties so you can't put anything heavy on these but it's enough to keep some of the light stuff off toiletries obviously so if I'm going for a shower I can just take this bag and I keep my towel under here I just grab a towel grab my bag ready to go in here and I have reflectix this just so this game with a box I had keeps going for it but this is all of my water storage I have five gallons of water you mentioned showers what are you doing for showers and bathing if I'm not someplace where I have a shower which is most of the time I just use a basin water you know soap towel and I just wash up in here I can wash my hair in here I have Hubbell basins and I just use that and I find it does perfectly well you get clean you don't have to have lots of running water and use 50 gallons to get clean and I really like how this is just a plain old table you bought a Walmart three wise 3030 like our box or something and it fit I had to measure you know the bed and the table so they would both fit I don't have it's not permanently attached to the walls I have a paracord here that it is tied to handle in the back and then fed through and tied to the bed frame ah so it's not going anywhere and of course one must have their their port-a-potty I couldn't stand that this was a bright orange bucket this end let's do this no no so I took some contact paper and just covered that up under here I have my tools which I love I've never used power tools I'm not particularly good at it yet I have very bad arthritis so I can't put together and take apart things that are hard but for somebody who has like limited hand strength and space these are great this is the Black & Decker matrix system and everything fits fairly small you have a drill I have an impact driver I have a jigsaw I have a sander an oscillating tool and a little tiny baby router which I can't wait to play with this is my kitchen cooking box I just what you'd have at home just like I have at home I don't need a ton of pots and pans I have one skillet my Dutch oven and then I have one larger pot for steaming vegetables and of course the Yeti I learned this one at the RTR done at the RTR showed that our yetis and they are fantastic so I can just heat water in the morning and then it stays hot all day over here I have my stove the butane stove and I like this I will probably eventually go to the one that does propane and butane and then here is you know the girly stuff this is my first aid kit and then of course you need your flushable wipes for Walmart this is so helpful I kept getting dog water spilled in the van all the time and I finally figured out how to put it in a bucket this is my $800 dog blocker there keeps them from going up front I bought this thinking it would be a good idea but I find with my arthritis I just can't start it it's a pull start  is my dog food job goals the essential treats of life so in the frontier have a caller for when I want to keep things cold I use this I need to bungee it to the seat but right now stuff that I need mapped papers for when I'm driving and I keep my laptop in here and you got a lot of storage here overhead so I have my reflected up here that I can keep folded flat to cover the windows at night and then I got some blackout curtains Walmart you made it so easy and cheap you thought huh do you have any idea how much you put into converting I really don't I mean it was mostly the foamboard isolation insulation the reflectix which is expensive the plywood and you know sheet vinyl I would say it was a few hundred dollars the most right and and all of it within reach of the average person right and and you don't have to have all the carpentry skills to get all that in just to start it's great I think it's amazing it's a great hold and super easy to use it's super easy super comfortable you know I'm surprised at how fast I felt at home in here right well thank you so much I really appreciate your sharing it with us thank you I think it's a real inspiration so they're having folks another inspirational tale of a life lived really well and becoming a nomad and enjoying your grade thanks again Caroline okay so everyone out there hope you've enjoyed the video and you if you liked it you like us on YouTube just subscribe to the channel and we'll talk to you later  [Music]", "dFneF74OemY": "[Music]  hi I'm Chuck with iws motor coaches it's been a while since I've done one of these videos me and my family have been out travelling around and our renegade having a little bit of fun so the last couple videos have had just music because well I wasn't here so today we're gonna talk about this 2020 renegade XL that we have and the renegade XL is really one of our flagship models it's one of renegades flagship models and I'm going to talk a little bit more about that but before we get too far because of all the comments out there that are coming about my legs I want to get some things clear number one I didn't ride a chicken in here and number two those aren't strings hanging out there for my actual legs so easy on the comments when it comes to my suntan line anyways enough with that having a little bit of fun more about this 2020 renegade XL what really I want to talk a little bit about the differences in construction so the renegade XL as you can see has an aero cap and it's only available with an aero cap that nice slope on the front you also notice up here at the top of the motorhome that it has a real nice radiused edge and in the back has a radius and a fiberglass end cap this is different construction than a renegade classic and this is this coach is made from laminated sidewalls and the best way I can tell you is imagine if the wall wasn't here you would see some aluminum tubing almost like studs in a in a framed house but they're aluminum tubing and then what they do is they basically lay that down on a big table and then the insulation goes in it and then another fiberglass sheet lays over it and they vacuum them together and that becomes a laminated sidewall they've they've laminated the pieces of fiberglass to it it makes a really nice smooth one-piece side you don't see any rivets there's no screws it's just a beautiful l\u00c3\u00a9a justjust a beautiful side here the other neat thing about the this co-chair being a flagship model is renegade this has a four color paint job on it and it's double clear-coated so the first clear coat goes on then it's sanded and then there's another clear coat and it's just a breathtaking look here a few more features about this motorhome that and we'll go into it a lot more in depth as we walk around it but it's tandem axle so it has a 80,000 pound gross combined weight rating so that means you can put this motorhome on a scale with the trailer and it could weigh up to 80,000 pounds so you have way more chassis underneath this motorhome it's just complete overbuilt and that's something that our customers like and we like and that's what really drove us into this market coming from the towing industry is as we felt other motorhomes out there didn't have a big enough chassis under and to support the things we want to do the other neat thing about hand up having tandem drive and both of these axles do drive this one isn't a tag is that you get an extra set of brakes underneath the back when would you go from single rear axle to attend an axle that's easy anytime you go over 37 foot we're gonna move you into a tandem this coach is 45 foot length and one thing I do want to point out you know when I started out in this any of you that have been with me on my journey as we've been building our business I started out with a 30 foot motorhome to pull my jet boat wanted something very maneuverable and as I've learned more and grown over the years me and my family now we're up to a 42-foot Motorhome because it gives us the things that we want and I just I don't have any trouble getting around these things drives so nice the they're they're extremely stable and about the only way to get that across is to have you come out here and I'm one of them with us and I think you'll see that just driving this 45 footer is just it's a dream it's very easy to do I know we had a gentleman in Mike out of Texas the other day and he talked a lot about these videos and said he was out here because of that it meant a lot to me Mike if you're watching I wanted to apologize that it wasn't able to get over and spend more time with you I had something come up but thanks for coming out so he asked me to really add a lot more detail to these videos and that's what I'm gonna do so we're gonna start here actually since we've got the Sun let's back up a little bit and talk about the back of this motorhome I'm gonna go ahead and step over here but as you can see it has a real nice fiberglass wrap around the back it offers better aerodynamics than a classic it's a little more slippery as it goes through the air as a result you're gonna get better fuel economy with an XL still has the 40,000 pound trailer hitch here on the back this has the two and five sixteenths ball we're awful also offering this coach with a receiver hitch too if you were to pull a trailer with air hookups we can hook your gladhands on here if you want you'll notice two exhausts coming out of the back of the motorhome this exhaust is off of the aqua hot diesel fired heater that heats the water and and heats the inside of the coach we'll talk more inside this exhaust right here is off of the 12.5 kW generator this here is just a backup light when you put it into reverse you can see they got these real nice LED stop turn and tail lights this plug-in right here is for your trailer connection and this is for your voyager camera so if you look up here you'll see we have a backup camera and then there's a third brake light vot lights in our area light but that back up camera will illuminate or show you what's going on back here but with the voyager if you're pulling a long trail we can put another camera on the back of your trailer and then you would just plug that in right here while we're back here excuse me I got allergies today so I may be sneezing through this you can see our back up light or our area light that we put here on the back so when you're hooking up a trailer at night or maybe you're just out at the lake and you need some lights you can flip that light on that's one of the options that we do and it's pretty standard on any iws coach that we build we think it's the right thing to do you'll also see there's two more going down the roof there so in this first compartment I'm going to open it up this is just a large storage compartment you can see we have the receiver hitch in there these are insulated doors they're carpeted inside you'll notice this wire right here so that tells you that we have a remote-controlled door lock feature on this compartment door we're gonna go ahead and move forward this is where we have the 450 aqua hot heater and what this is is this is a diesel fired burner inside and it runs hot glycol so what happens is in the winter the diesel burner will come on it uses the diesel fuel in your fuel tank as you're driving down the road or when you're parked and that diesel fires that burner up and then this hot glycol is recirculated through the coach and that's what heats the coach neat thing about that is if you're traveling down the road in the winter you can flip a switch and the engine heat will cycle through here so you're not running the diesel burner when you're heating the Motorhome when you do get to your RV hookup you can plug it in and it'll go from diesel fire to electric fired the only thing I do want to point out is if you want a really super hot shower you'll leave it plugged in and the electrical take the water up to a certain temperature and then the deesser burner will kick on when you need that extra boost of super hot water alright that's enough of the aqua hot now as here's our  area lighting right here this will come on you can flip a switch on there and that's going to go ahead and eliminate this area when you're backing up it operates independent than our upper lights here as we get here here's another large storage compartment  we also offer shelves and stuff that's something we build here at iws for our customers here's another compartment that we have right here large storage compartment here's a built-in television so if you notice we have the Sun coming down on us here you can still see that when the Sun Goes Down and it gets later in the night you can push this up to its second stage 32 inch flat-screen TV in here DVD player you can play music through the speakers this is just a really nice addition for this RV go ahead and close this up here you have a 2 110 outlet so if you want to run a barbecue grill or power up you know an Xbox or something out here you can do that there's another storage compartment so pretty much all the compartments on this side which is known as the curb side of the motorhome or the passenger side these are virtually all storage compartments except for the last one now as we come up here to the entrance door it's a real nice curved radius door this grab handle illuminates at night and then there's a key code here so you can use this to get in and out of the coach I'm going to open the door just a little bit ready gates done a nice job of upgrading the door handles so you got a nice grab handle to grab on when you open this the wind won't pull it out of your hand it's got a really nice screen right here and then you can slide this to lock it if you don't want to use that you can hook it on right here I'm going to go ahead and flip the step lock so when I close the door it's not going in and out we move back up here to the cab the chassis cap you'll see this Bendix Bendix sensor and what that does is there's a there I'll show you when we get inside the cab there's a light on the passenger side on the a pillar of the of the truck and this sensor is always looking out here and if anybody or anything gets in in this sensor area a sounds gonna go off inside and a little lights going to illuminate to let you know there may be somebody here in your blind spot now as we move around up onto the hood of the vehicle here's your turn signal camera so this camera is looking back at this angle when you turn your right turn signal on this is going to give you a view down this side of the coach so this is kind of the blind spot of any Motorhome when you're a driver what's really neat is you've got a camera looking back you got this really big mirror looking back and you have this electronic sensor looking back so you've got an awful lot of coverage here in the blind spot spot and it makes driving these things a lot easier while I go ahead and move around I'm going to go ahead and let Zack kind of film around the front you can get a good look at these LED headlights that's new for on these 20/20 models I think they just look really sexy in there it's a good looking coach you'll also notice on the front you have these holes and this is where you can put in the pole rings this is the front-facing sensor that's going to tell you if you're getting too close to a vehicle there's an alarm inside that'll go off we'll talk about that collision mitigation when we get inside there's also a sensor up in the top of the windshield that's looking forward as well and it's helping to make sure you're staying inside the lane so if you drift out of your lane audible alarm is going to sound I'm going to go ahead and open up the hood here and talk a little bit about this Detroit engine  go ahead and open the hood what's really neat about a Class C motorhome is serviceability just about anything you want to access is right here so it's really easy when you if you break down you could take it into a Freightliner dealer you don't have to take it to anybody super specialized you can take it to a Detroit distributor most truck shops whether it's Freightliner Kenworth Peterbilt can all service a Detroit engine serviceability is another thing here's your windshield washer fill it's really easy to get to here's your transport hooks if you need to use them for anything excuse me I want to talk to you a little bit more about this engine so this is a Detroit DD 16 engine 15 point 8 liters it's 600 horsepower currently it's the largest engine produced that we can have put into a class 8 truck we can't buy anything any bigger so we're for our customers we're putting the biggest and the baddest engine in these things we possibly can what's really neat about this engine is it would not it so in the if you were to look in the used truck paper you'll see a lot of trucks for sale with three hundred four hundred thousand miles that's low miles in the truck world high miles in the truck world or seven eight hundred to a million miles plus that's a lot better that's getting high mileage that's not even excessive miles it's reasonable to believe based on the be 50 life rating of this engine that you should expect to get close to a million miles if not more out of this engine without any service what major service works so this thing's designed to be ran I haven't looked lately but I believe the oil change interval on this engine is twenty-five thousand miles on normal duty so it's kind of like well I forget the guy's name on king of the hill they asked him how often he changes his oil and he said every 3,000 miles or when I get bored and I can assure you you're probably gonna get you'll you'll either get bored or you'll have too many years going before you hit the mileage that you need to change the oil on these and that and that all goes back to cost what I'm trying to say to you is this is a truck engine and it's gonna last this thing a lifetime this truck will be running up and down the road long after I've gone it's just an incredible power plant okay I'm gonna go ahead and close the hood up and then we're gonna go ahead and pause while I turn this thing around so we can get the sun shining on this side and we'll talk a little bit more about the features you know actually what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and run the awnings out and run the slides out on this side [Music] okay we're going to go ahead and run the hunting out Zach I'm gonna have you back up just a little bit because I really want people to see this two-stage effect to it so the awning comes out straight and then it's going to droop down to really help when you have a low Sun we actually have a fairly low Sun today so you're going to see hopefully you'll start to see some shades start to develop  so just to give you an idea for height so I'm 6 foot tall so you're you're looking at about an 8 foot eave height right here there's also an LED light strip that runs the full length of this it does a really nice job in the evening of just casting some light down here on you there you can see the slide outs out one of the reasons we're not a big fan of putting a slide right here is because it really takes away from this experience of being able to sit back here and here and have a nice chair and just look at it like right now I'm looking out at the beautiful Idaho mountains Bennett Mountain right over there and if I have a slide right here it starts to take away from all of that space ok now I'm going to go ahead and run the awning back in and pull the slide in and we're going to turn this beauty around [Music] okay here we are so we got her turned around so I'm going to walk you through the compartments on this side so this first apartment is where the batteries are housed there's also an air connection here if you want to hook an air hose on to air up your tires there's an airport given right there to large 8 D batteries these are for the Motorhome and these are for the chassis this compartment houses the inverter and there's also room in here for storage so the neat thing about the inverter what it's going to do is take the 12-volt battery power it converts it to AC electricity so like right now the coach is not plugged in the generator is not running but you could still be sitting inside enjoying TV refrigerator still going to run we come along this side this is sewage compartment there's a sewage tank in here and it continues on into this compartment so what you have is you have 75 gallons of greywater storage which is shower and sink water and then you have 75 gallons of black tank storage which is what comes out of the toilet some notable features that we do here is that we add extra heat strips to the bottom of these so they won't freeze we also have an aqua hot heat exchanger in there so that in the winter it's circulating circulating hot like all through the compartment to help keep these from freezing we also have a ceramic insulation insulation package sprayed inside of here so you know it's hard for people you know what what separates one dealer from the other and we just try to do it right we try not to cut a single corner look the last thing I want is for you to call me two years from now or a year from now after buying this and say geez Chuck I wish you'd have told me about ceramic temp coat and I wish you would have told me about aqua hot heating options in here we don't want you to have any regrets so we try to do everything in our power to load this thing up with every option that we fill this coach that had or that our customers still have added a lot of value to their coaches one of those options is the macerator so what the macerator is it's this pump right here and it has an impeller in it and what it does is it grinds up all the waste product in it and it emulsifies it so that when you go to drain your black tank and your gray tank this is the only hose you have and you just take this hose stick it in the ground turn it on and then you can hit the switch and it'll pump now in the event that this should ever fail you can disconnect right here and put the regular 3-inch black hose on so we've tried to build some redundancy okay this back compartment right here is our wanted water management compartment for a lot of you watching this video you know all about this but for those of you that don't I'm gonna walk you through a few things here's your low point drain so what this will do or excuse me this is your pressure I spigot so this is just like a water spigot at your house you can hook a hose on wash your car off wash the motor home with this is a low point drain so in the winter when you if you want to winterize you open this valve up and all the water will drain backwards out of it so the water from here to the motor home won't freeze this is called a spray away there's a coiled hose right inside of here with a spray one on it you pull it out hook it on here and you'll have more of a high-pressure hose which is great for hosing out coolers or spraying off kids they got too much sand on their feet it's a nice option this flojet turns on the macerator pump you pull this out to dump your black tank your gray tank this is your black tank wash so when you hook your water hose on right here onto that fitting there's a sprinkler inside the black tank that'll run and it washes out your black tank cable TV TV input and your freshwater input you can choose from city water or to fill your tanks so this motorhome has a hundred and fifty gallons of freshwater storage underneath the master bed which is really nice or any gates move that water inside so that it doesn't freeze in the winter one hundred and fifty gallons so let me tell you what so we were just up in salmon Idaho me and two other people we were up there for a Razer rally dry camping we were three of us were able to shower every single night cook do most of our normal stuff and we were able to go four days and four nights without running out of water and and that was without skimping so 150 gallons is a lot of water now as we move around to the back this is the last two compartments here's our own in 12.5 kW generator and this is a monster if you look right I'm going to move around here and get in here if you look right here you'll see that that's a Kubota engine so that's the same engine that they would use in a Kubota tractor this is just an incredible power plant it's I feel it's the right choice it's more power than you need but again we don't want you to have any regrets this is exact same generator I have in my personal coach if you read the manual on this Kubota will tell your Cummins Onan will tell you they'd rather you run this generator a lot than to run it just a little bit use this thing run the heck out of it and and just enjoy life  now that we come into the last compartment this is our powered cord reel so you manually pull it out I got to scoot around you here and then when you want to wind it in you just push the button and it winds in your 50m we also have a surge guard inside of this coach we've had renegade put in a 30 amp outlet as well as just a regular 20 amp outlet so you can run power tools this one our theory is if you want to buy a stacker trailer from us we sell ATC all aluminum stacker trailers you want to put a big stacker trailer behind this we can run that cord plug it in and you'll have enough generator run the to be able to run the air conditioning in your stacker trailer with all of that being said it's time to move to the inside of the coach wow that's the first thing that everybody says when they come into this coach it's just absolutely breathtaking in here  we wanted to take a moment and pan around to try to let you take this coach in and look at the colors the ultra leather fabrics the countertops the lighted edges in the countertops the solid maple cabinetry the vessel Bowl sinks in the bathroom the Flex steel furniture the picture windows that we put in this coach it's just breathtaking  [Music] I'm gonna have Zack show you the overhead decor in this coach so you can see the infinity light it's just beautiful up there well now now that we've done a quick pan around in the coach and let you kind of absorb it I'm gonna go a little bit slower talk about some of the features here's the digital controller this is where you can control the door slides you can turn the lights on and on I'll go back to the to the coach slides can be controlled from here here's your water tanks and sewage this is where you can start the generator  here's your lighting controls the interior and exterior it's very intuitive very easy to run this here is your awning control so we can excuse me turn the awning on you can run it out you can set the intensity level at which the wind can blow before the awning comes in just a really nice feature before we get going too far too much further on the interior a lot of people have asked us how loud is the generator how loud is the air conditioning so today here in Idaho it's going to be over a hundred degrees outside it's the heats building so we've went ahead and started the generator the air conditioners are running right now and we're gonna leave them on throughout the coach so you can really get a sense of what it's like to be in one of these with the generator and air conditioning on so here we have the television and you can pull this lever right here you can slide the TV out and pivot it you know wherever you want to have the the best viewing angle also has a built-in sound bar I really think it was a good decision to go away from the speakers in the ceiling to this because when the speakers are in the ceiling and you're watching TV up here the people in the back are getting blasted so with the sound bar it kind of controls the direction of the sound and I think this is a really good upgrade you can also play your Bluetooth music through it and all of that here we've got all of the overhead cabinetry as I mentioned before the neat thing is is that renegade finishes them out the back of the cabinet is well finished out as the front of the cabinet here you can see we've got a reclining rocker this is a great feature on it it's a great place to you can slide it out and kick back you can turn it around if you want to watch TV or just keep it here if you have guests we have a lot of people that travel with their dogs and they actually take the recliner out and put their dog crates right here so it's just a great utilization of space now as we move over here to the rest of the kitchen cabinets you can see all the really nice wood trim balances I'll go ahead and remove these seat covers or sink covers place them here on the seat you've got a very deep residential sink you know we're always torn whether to do a split sink or a single sink based on the feedback from our customers they really like the single sink so that's pretty much what we're going with we have overhead lights right here so there's lots of lighting here we put in extra outlets here in the backsplash and notice the tile when we have a coach built we request the tile go all the way up here on the countertop you'll notice the LED light edges that you can program these different colors and get them to do a whole bunch of things here's the true induction cooktop as I mentioned on a lot of videos we really like it because it gives you a lot of counter space it'll only get hot if you have kids if the plates metal so there's magnets in here that have to activate to get this to work here we have the Samsung microwave it's a convention microwave I said this in just about every video I've ever done we liked it so much we have one at our house we really like that convention or convection cooking here's a little bit you can see a nice detail of the dovetail construction of the cabinet's on this it's all solid maple hardwood soft close drawers this actually has the stacked silverware drawer in it so you can have silverware on the bottom and on the top lots of storage we've got a spot here that you can tilt the house you can keep your scrub brushes and and and stuff here for the sink there's storage under here this is a little storage space that my wife is I think she had a big hand in its making sure that there was a spot to store pots and pans so we really try to whenever we can have renegade design in a large area for that got some more storage underneath you can see the finish work is just awesome and we're gonna go ahead and open up this pantry this this a newer style of pantry it's a slide-out that we're trying it's fully adjustable so you can adjust the shelves up and down and then you can store your canned goods and whatever you want in here you can see the holes here that Aden adjusting we've also put a neat little latch on it so it can stay closed down here is the electrical panel so if you have a circuit breaker issue or anything you've got really quick and easy access to it up above here is all of the digital because this is a whole digital management system what's really neat is so number one is the living room ceiling light you can go to number one we got a green light so everything's are good so we can really aid you in diagnostics and that's something maybe now is a good time to just bring up our advantage package so one of the things that we're doing that we feel is very exclusive is we've invested heavily in to our video department typically we have three full-time videographers and what we're doing is we're making our advantage videos we're making very detailed mini videos on you know how to use this power distribution panel and what to do if you have a problem how to run the generator how to run the auto generator start what to do if your macerator doesn't work and we're developing these videos and when you buy a motor home from us we provide you with our own iPad that has all of these videos embedded in it we also give you access a private access to the back side of our website where our customers can log in and watch these videos so if you're traveling down the road there's so much to remember and you can't remember how to program your generator you can watch that little mini video each year we just add more and more to it and that's something that's only available to our customers a few more things about our exclusivity I've always felt we want to sell luxury coaches and back it up with luxury service our shop is one of the best shops in the nation we only work on our customers motorhomes that's it we want to make sure we stay exclusive to you we also have our V hookups on site we just put in two more brand new ones so when you're traveling by our facility you can swing in use our RV site for a day or two if you want and then you can move on we also wash your motorhome for free when you swing in we want you to feel like this is home a home away from home you can come in we also offer extended roadside service free of charge when you buy a motor home from us we fill up the fuel tanks we fill up the propane tanks we're gonna put you up not at our RV site we go ahead and put you up at the RV site downtown because we would like you to go down there and really just set up for one night and come back to us in the morning if you have any questions all of these things are exclusive only to our customers so we're really trying to make sure we're available to you and we back that up by offering 24-hour seven-day-a-week service so people here rotate having an emergency cell phone with them so if you have any problems you can call us and you're gonna get a voice on the other end of the line to try to walk you through whatever problems so we really take pride in trying to make this experience the best we can for you well we're gonna move over here and talk a little bit about the frigerator as you can see it's a double dent our double door Samsung Refrigerator lots of room in here it's a actual residential refrigerator renegades also put a latch right here so you can lock the door I'm gonna slide open the freezer so you can see that there's a icemaker here a tray here for more frozen food and in the larger tray down there on the bottom now as we move over here to the dinette this is a feature we've been waiting for for quite a while renegade is now offering dual seatbelts in the dinette as its facing forward so if you have kids or guests they can sit here at the dinette be buckled in while you're traveling down the road there's also three seatbelts in the sofa so you can carry up to five people guests in the back and they'll all be seat-belted in here we are at the dinette this is kind of a neat feature that we've been installing now for several years so I'm pretty proud of is we're having renegade put these nice picture windows here it's quite a bit bigger so we've eliminated the overhead cabinets to try to give you a real nice spacious view out the window I think it works very well  here's the day shade so as you pull it down it reduces the Sun glare and then you can pull down your Night Shade and have even more privacy at night you can see there's built-in drink holders here solid surface countertop it's very similar to quarry on another nice thing is you can unfold this lever and you can push this guy down and then you'll have a spot for guests to sleep raise it back up lock it in place another neat feature or these built-in drawers that slide out and have them on both sides I also want to point out that there's a 110 and a USB outlet underneath the the dinette here it's very nice to be able to charge your phone or your laptop I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about the sofa it folds out into an air mattress I have the exact same sofa in my coach has a real nice air pump you just click on and in about three minutes its inflated we use ours continually my friends our kids have all slept on it and they like it they do want to point out the wall sconces here and in the digital controller so this is kind of neat so from right here I can dim the lights maybe I'll get Zack to go back on them so you can see on the overhead light there over the dinette you can push that and then you can control the dimming how bright you want them turn the sofa lights off dinette I can turn all the lights off from here floor accent lights wall sconce can go down right there and then you could power everything up and you'll see as we go through the video or the video there's these controls are all out the coach and you also have a light master right here that'll turn all the lights off and then you can turn them all back on from right here so it's kind of a neat this multiplexing is kind of a neat feature well we're gonna go ahead and move well before we get up here I do want to point out the 110 outlet and USB the reason I keep going back to these things is these are the difference between enjoying your trip or not imagine you buy a Motorhome you don't have an outlet here your kids or your guests are sitting here and they're frustrated because their iPads or their Nintendo 3ds or whatever they can't charge it so by putting these here we're really trying to enhance your experience we also have overhead cabinets all right up in here before I move down into the cockpit I want to point out that this is where we would put your DirecTV here's your blu-ray DVD player your Weingard satellite system and this coach also has an in motion so it has both it has the high-definition large satellite that powers up just like a TV station would and then it also has an in motion satellite dome so you now have both of them on the same coach which is a really nice option we specify graded metal rather than glass to try to help keep the heat out of there that's an iws deal over here is some overhead controls I'll try to stand to the side here's your Magnum inverter this is your auto gen start as I mentioned this is all covered in our iws advantage videos here's your control system that we talked about earlier you know you can run the slides from here you can run exterior lights interior lights rear lights you have auxilary features so your engine preheat or your emergency start it's all located right here this coach is equipped with solar panels on the roof and this is a controller here and here's your heating and cooling controls so it's all nice at eye level you don't have to bend over to see it and then it's the driver side compartment there storage and I carry a satellite telephone so I've been requested in the 110 outlet up here so I can keep my cell light phone charged at all times well now we're gonna move down in here but before I get too low I want to point out some of the features up here you've got your sunglass holder whoops this is a nice storage compartment right here more light or sunglasses more storage here you've got your red light if you can see that and that's so if your passengers reading at night they say red light doesn't bother the driver and then you got your clear light or you have your brighter light right there here's the auto jack leveling system so when it's time to level this motorhome you just touch the power and hit Auto level and the hydraulic jacks come out and level it so just to give you an idea what the noise levels like I'm gonna go ahead and start this coach up you heard a couple buzzes so one of the buzzes is the collision mitigation going through itself check on it so I want to talk about some of the features I really cannot say enough about the seating position in these coaches yep it when you're sitting here looking out the front I got get my armrest down getting my traveling position I feel like I'm sitting in my pickup just higher I really like that I can see taillights coming on way down the road I got a really nice hood coming out here so I can really tell where I am in space the mirror position is just like in my pickup and this thing is just a dream to drive I tell everybody on a 2 or 3 hundred mile trip I don't think you could drive it faster in a pickup we these things cruise so nice this has tilt steering wheel as well as telescope so you can get the steering wheel exactly where you want it has the cruise control on and off accelerate decelerate and cancel has your marker interrupter button right here and what that does is it flashes your marker light so if you pass somebody and they turn their headlights on you can say thank you engine brake on/off right here I guess it's probably best for the engine brake for you to call in and have us talk you through all of those features but it's just a it's a feature that I would I would never order a truck without it never okay I'm gonna tilt the wheel down just a little bit over here on the door compartment you got your power windows up your door lock your power mirrors it's got a real nice grab handle right here and an easy to open door as I mentioned I we've started this truck up so you can really hear what the sound is like on it when you're sitting in it here's your oil gauge your axle temp your front differential temperature your rear differential temperature water heat rpm this Lane searching light is the forward-looking radar it's looking for the white lines on the road and when it's on it's telling you it's not picking them up here's your trip computer and everything in here speedometer oil pressure air dual air gauges as well as the air pressure on the rear airbags this parking brake here is for the trailer so you would never use this unless you're pulling a trailer this air button right here you pull out and that sets the parking brake and that does set the air brakes on both rear axles this is just your lighting control up and down emergency light in the step well where my feet are there's a light you can turn on and off here's your three stage engine brake low medium high  you have your exhaust regeneration your override shut down automatic traction control so you can run with that when you're running on slick roads and it'll automatically lock differentials your menu control back and forth for up here heated mirrors your docking lights that come on outside here's your fan control we got the fan running the air conditioning on and then here's all your power outlet now as we move up this is the air dump valve so we can lower the rear air suspension on this which you may want to do depending on you know where you're parking this locks the differentials together in a sense turns this thing into four-wheel drive by flipping them you can see here we have a left front tire that's 19 psi low so we lowered some of the air to set the alert on here so you guys could see that here's your transmission selector this little connection point right here is the USB so we have our halo 9 system that we're putting in this is a 9 inch flat screen it also has a backup capability I'll go ahead and put it in reverse and now you can see the backup camera there's my pickup sitting back there you can also turn the hitch guide on see the arrow right there you could turn the hitch guide off or alignment you can take there's all kinds of  things that you can do to program this thing you can play it through the blue way ray I'm going to put it back in neutral you can go you have apple carplay so you can plug your phone in it we we put a sub Sirius speakers in here and  a very large subwoofer this is something we're quite proud of and I really like this because the older I get the harder it is for me to see and having a real nice big touchscreen everything on here can be just swipe you know if I want to switch the Bluetooth I just go there you can always go back to your home button here go to auxiliary back to the home button you go through setup you can also run the camera you can you can turn the camera on while you're driving down the road so there's a lot of neat features here here's your collision mitigation this is going to give you a readout when you're coming up on somebody and tell you how close you are and as you get closer and closer to the vehicle alarms are gonna go off and there is a point where this thing will automatically apply park or automatically apply brakes to help prevent the collision you know they have a great video online at Bennett and I think it says two seconds matters and they were talking about how many accidents could be avoided if the driver just had two extra seconds of warning and that's what this is gonna give you right here trailer brake controller if you run air air brakes on it this seat has air valve or air bag underneath it so I'm gonna go ahead and lower it I can raise it if I want I've got fully adjustable armrests so you can set all these different levels on it once you set it and you put it back it always goes back to the same spot so here I'm gonna go ahead and put it at this angle I stow it and then when I put it back it's back at this angle so great adjustability there you also have the seat back adjustment on it as well the passenger seat does swivel around so you can be facing the other way as well as this one this is a little bit harder to pivot this one we typically only swivel around the passenger's seat we also have our iws drink holder and cell phone holder we're not showing it in the video some things we just kind of keep between us and our customers so there you are we've pretty much wrapped up the front now we're going to continue the tour down the motorhome I'm gonna go ahead and shut this thing off and here we go here's the midship private toilet Zack it's I'm just gonna let you go ahead and film in there see it has a lighted vanity around the edge of the counter mirrored medicine cabinet nice storage under the vanity got the macerator toilet in it with storage over the top we had a window installed in this one so let in some natural light now we're gonna go ahead and close out I'm going to turn right here point out the stacked washer and dryer right here these things work just like your home washer and dryer wood now we're gonna go into the the master bedroom so this has the renegade style wardrobe closet in it and I'm opening up all of these because so that you can see this is all pass through and renegades thinking was that you can slide clothes that maybe you don't need for a while here in the center and they'll slide in behind the TV and then the clothes you use on a more frequent basis will be out also notice how they stained clear to the back even if you were to look on the back side of the TV it's all finished lots of storage down here there's your satellite TV as well as your DVD and blu-ray player in this coach there's one two three four 110 outlets in the bedroom so we never wanted you to be far away from them you also have digital controller right here to turn the lights on and off so when you're laying in bed you could just reach up and turn them on and off lots of overhead storage here you can start the generator while you're laying in bed storage compartments nightstand so you can carry your you know your cell phone your pistol whatever you want we were water bottle right here beside the bed now I'm gonna go ahead and let Zack Cohen first into this bathroom because it is just breathtaking it's just something you would never expect to see in most motorhomes and it I think renegade just knocked this out of the park lots and storage in here vessel bowl sinks lighted leading edge on all of the countertops lots of medicine cabinets they keep using the word lots and spectacular but it's the only way I know how to describe this when you get into the shower over here there's a large sunroof over the top of it that's letting in a bunch of natural light they've got a built-in seat in it I know my wife really appreciates having that I'm gonna go ahead and sneak in here after he films the toilet the macerator actually probably be the best to get it across is just to open up the doors and let you see the size of this medicine cabinet there's another medicine cabinet here and then more here so there's lots of storage in here we also have his and hers outlets in the wall so you know if you have a cellphone or electric razor slide-out drawers this one's fixed you got storage underneath as well as storage over here these two drawers slide out I've already talked about the shower but I'm gonna go ahead and step inside so you can see as I mentioned I'm 6 foot with my hat on here there's still lots of room to get in here and shower I just wanted you to see the large linen closets that you have here just tons and tons of storage there's also a coat rack in here or a rod so if you want to hang more of your clothes well I hope you've enjoyed this video as I say in every video we just try to get better and better you know on this one we ran the air conditioning and generator the whole time trying to give you a sense of what it's like talk a little bit about price on this coach so we're asking five hundred and nineteen thousand dollars but due to our agreement with renegade we can't advertise the best price we can give you you'll have to call in for that well as they say in every video I really want to thank you for spending some time with us and and thank you so much for subscribing to our channel if you like this and you're not a subscriber it means a lot if you subscribe to us you know today it's a hundred degrees outside it's a little hard to dig deep to get out and film but when we when we see all the positive comments and we see the viewers and the subscribers it makes it all worthwhile so thanks again for your time and I hope to see you out on the road you [Music]", "vdPxRl8bK_0": "", "L2xSDsfjvaE": "today I'm gonna be showing you how to professionally fill a hole in the wall and paint it and get it completely finished and done and dusted you'll never even know what was there and you'll be able to do the whole lot in a single day without having to wait for plaster to dry and all that sort of thing  hi welcome back to guff of handyman and welcome to this little job we've got here where I've been running cables up through this wall and really common situation where you've got big holes in plaster boards that you need to fill this technique that I use works really well on just bog-standard drywall and on dab walls as well I strongly recommend when you're cutting the holes in the drywall in the first place don't just cut out some random shape use a proper hole saw drill and it just me it's a much much neater professional way of doing it and the big advantage of using the hole drill is that you're left with a piece to put back in when you're done and we're going to use that later on if it's an unusual shape of hole so it's not a circular hole for whatever reason don't attempt to cut out a piece of plaster board to fit the hole instead cut out a bit of plaster board shove it on the wall draw around it cut out that hole and then we're going to fit the plaster board into that Hall but for this I've already got the little plugs leftover from where I drilled this out and these are gonna be perfect for the job the really big advantage of using the original plaster board that came out of the hole is that if there's any skin on the plaster board and you don't know what thickness the skins gonna be well you're then returning that skin to where it was if you use a brand new piece of plaster board in the hall and if you line up the back of that with the back of this depending on how thick the skin is you're then going to also have to skin whatever depth under the plasterboard but the skin is already on here so you don't need to bother doing that you've saved yourself a job before I show you all the stuff that you're gonna need for this job don't forget to hit subscribe the only reason I do boring videos like this is to try and draw new people to the channel I don't normally make good use of filling holes anyway stuff you're gonna need a bit of words just a scrap bit of them like pine or something like that it's gonna be hidden in the wall you're never gonna see it you're gonna need the original core that you drilled out the wall in the first place you're gonna need some proper plaster board screws dry ball screws some one and only time that you'll see me using drywall screws you'll need two obsolete phillips bit to go with it you're gonna need filler and I've got two different ones here to show you depending where you are on the planet I don't know how readily available this is this is a two-part phyllis so it's like a resin a two-part resin the big advantage of going down this route is that it dries completely solid ready for sanding in about 10 minutes we've got the wrong seal high-performance wood filler ignore the fact that it says wood filler it fills anything it's basically the same as car body filler as far as I'm concerned the big advantage of the Ron seal is that it comes in white and when you're using it on a white wall having white filler means that you need less pain afterwards to paint over it but it is quite expensive the other option is to go for something like this this is bonded deck or fill which using buy in great big tubs if you're buying great big tubs of it I would recommend that you decant it off in like a jar and use bits of it at a time using it out this massive tub all the time isn't particularly practical and this video isn't being sponsored by Doritos but like the Doritos chip like dip jars they work really well don't use a jar that has a plastic lid on it these have metal lids if you use a plastic lid you'll probably find the fumes from that will melt the plastic the bonded echo fill is a much it's basically the same stuff but it's much cheaper because he embodied in a giant tub the downside is that it's a kind of darkish gray color so you're gonna need a lot more paint to cover it up afterwards whereas of Ron seal is much closer at the white not it's not perfectly white but it just means you're gonna need less coats of paint and then you're gonna need something to mix this on I find old laminate flooring works really well and you can need to filling knives I've done videos on how to use two-part Phyllis before I'll include a link in the description I'm not going to go into that in crazy amounts of detail you're also going to need like a stanley knife type thing of some description and obviously you need a cup of coffee oh and some sandpaper so the first thing you're going to do is get your stanley knife and we're going to put a chamb furred edge around this it'll just help trustus it makes life much easier later on we're just going to sham for the edge of the plug should only take a couple of minutes  obviously forgot to mention that's a front edge it's not the back edge that you're gonna jump for it's a front edge you'll see why in a minute and then you're gonna do exactly the same thing on the hall shumpert this edge the whole idea of this is that you want to get rid of all the kind of ragged edges and we're also giving something for the filler to sit on afterwards a little rugged a little to get any dust or anything out of that Hall you can just use a dry paintbrush now get you a bit of wood and we're gonna screw that in place now it can be tricky to hold on to that bit of wood so what you can do is a touch like a screw into the front of it temporarily just see it and hold onto it  except don't be a dozy pillock and make it so that you can't actually no get it in the hole do not drop you a bit of wood well want the heads of the screws to be just below the surface by what a millimeter or two mil not too far in but definitely not flush or sticking out no you see once that's done you can take this screw but now we're going to use the two-part resin to glue this onto here [Music] right you haven't got long to work with this so what I'm gonna do is just butter the edges of this piece don't worry if it goes everywhere you know put a nice big kind of blob of this stuff on the back bit there you've got to work quick because this stuff sets really quickly  you've got to get that plug in the wall within a matter of a minute I would say the whole idea with this is that you get the front of that flush with the front of that because I've been working on with a camera and shuttin it Center the villas ended up going off quicker than I'd hoped but I think we'll be fine this will set completely solid in about ten minutes so what you're gonna do now is use your other scraper to clean this and get it all nice and clean do not put old filler back into your tub that's got the new filler because the old filler can make your new filler go off [Music] I've waited about 10 minutes you'll physically you'll feel the filler will get hot as it sets or is the it's a catalytic reaction between the hardener and the filler and you'll feel it gets hot as it as it goes off and then once it's cooled back down again that's it generally ready it and tell because it's like rock solid give it a quick sound just so there's nothing kind of sticking above the level of you where you're gonna be putting the final filler on  brush up down or even better you can use one of them newfangled cooler things a  couple of things I forgot to mention before cuz I thought it was kind of obvious but if you are going to be core drilling or using a hole saw into a wall don't just plunge this into the wall and assume you're not going to hit anything because that is the actions of a person who's calling out an emergency plumbing what I would always suggest you do do all the usual checks again I've done a video all about this I'll include a link in the description below use a detector and all that sort of thing if nothing else pop a blunt masonry bit on do an exploratory hole with the blunt masonry bit have a little feel around make sure there's no pipes and cables behind and then very tentatively going with the core drill you should be okay still not guaranteed because all sorts of stuff gets hidden behind walls and while I'm at it if you live in a world of pink fluffy bunnies and zero fumes and you don't like the smell of like industrial things you're not gonna like two-part filler it's got a very strong smell to it the smell goes away once it's gone off and it's completely gone once it's painted but if strong smells offend you and you think it's gonna kill you then just Park your wall full of straw or something like that instead [Music]  [Music]  [Music] so all I've done I've now used to run sealed the white filler as you can see it's not quite white but more white than the gray filler and I've put that in as quickly as I could into the gaps and then used a big filler knife which I need to clean to kind of level it off we're not looking to get absolutely a hundred percent at this stage but we want to get it like as flat as possible so another ten minutes has passed that's solid ready for sound and you can tell if you can't dig your nail into it it's generally ready the rock will give that a quick Sun so we're not aiming to get a hundred percent depend on where this is I mean you know that's probably better than the wall around it to be honest don't aim to get it perfect on every quarter but normally that would probably be fine for most situations because I'm a bit of a funny I'm gonna do one more mix of filler and just fill in these tiny little bits around there a little bit there and then that'll be it ready for paint but as I say don't aim to get it perfect on every quarter filler you'll you'll find you shouldn't need any more than three goes over one I came to do the the rough villain one for you your main court and then optionally a third bit of filler for you you clean a hairline cracks and by the way I can hear it in the comments now or I'll crack overtime it doesn't what you sometimes do if there's very very slight imperfection sitting rub a bit a cork and do it and that'll make it literally invisible by the time you get paint over it actually now that I've removed this it's sucked some of the dust out of a little gap here and I'm gonna do another really quick bit feel like just four there and a little bit there when you're doing these kind of final bits of changes perfectionism you want your filler knife to be nice and sharp and just no rough bits on the tip be careful cuz I mean it could easily cut yourself on that only need tiny bit of filler for this don't mix more than use because it just goes off tiny bit here on this last little run a filler sometimes you can get it so smooth that barely needs to be sanded tiny bit there that's perfect  we're starting to get it flatter than the wall around it it depends where you're doing this you know if it's in an area that's like at eye level obviously you want to take a bit more care over it  so you now want to give it a quick coat of primer preferably primer that's been stirred  you can paint over this with more or less anything but I would suggest you prime it first so just give it a coat of primer I'm just using a water-based acrylic primer under court here you can roller it on if you want I'm just brushing this because I'm gonna feather it in the existent pinned well leave that to dry depend on what primary have used that can take and now we're also it dry so gonna have a copper go and get on with some other jobs check what it says on your tin for how long is supposed to leave your primer to dry don't lose sleep over it if it feels dry it'll probably be fine on a little area like this don't stress out about it just to preempt some of the truly comments stand mayor says I've used this before I applied it with my child's face as per the instructions it looked terrible don't listen to this so-called professional well Stan honestly I don't know what's going on there my pot of debt or field specifically says on it do not apply using your child's face Kerry Labonte or is it Labonte says can you use soup I wouldn't recommend soup for filling holes and was Chris Simon Brian Dave says you you have no clue go back to where you came from and stop stealing our jobs I your mother dad Chris then goes on to see can you use soup the Primus dry now so I'm just going to use a roll up for the top coat I'm going to give it a couple of coats of the top coat it's just whiteness but the roller will help to blend it in a bit better obviously try newsprint that's not full of bits  the pouch where the filler is will always get a bit darker when the paint wet that's completely normal let it dry and then judge it you'll probably find that once the paint's dried you can't see it if you can do another quart you shouldn't need any more than two top coats normally but it depends how dark the filler is or the color of your walls and stuff like that we'll come back once it's dry there we'll go absolutely perfect if you didn't know otherwise you would never know anything had happened to this wall I hope you've enjoyed this don't forget to subscribe I'll make this whole effort worthwhile as I say I don't have made much better videos than this [Music]", "MLSu0Myxvr0": "Hello everybody and welcome to another studio session with Ben and Rebecca, from his and hers vlogs! Today..... We're going to share the dark side of RV living with you. It's actually a follow-up to last week's video which was all warm and fuzzy where we shared the good and amazing things about the RV life. So if you don't know, Beck and I have spent the better part of the last two years on the road, exploring a good chunk of North America. And we're taking these studio sessions as an opportunity to download all our experiences to you!...Number 1, You are never going to find the perfect RV! It's just a reality. You're always going to have to make sacrifices and compromises in order to get into a rig. But.... The way to overcome this is just to go do it! Except that there will be things that you just don't love about it but you can live with them and get out on the road and have a good time anyway! Number 2...The weather can really suck when you're on the road full time! Mother nature is going to catch up to you at some point. It's a reality! We've encountered random snowstorms, freak wind storms, excessive heat for the time of year, a lot of stuff!... And in relation to what Beck was just talking about, maybe when you're looking for an RV you should take into consideration comfortable places to hang out! Because there's gonna be a lot of days where you're stuck inside that thing watching the crappy weather outside. And at the end of the day you want to be able to look at each other and say, gosh! That wasn't all that bad!..... Number 3...Things are going to break! We really actually don't know anybody who's been on the road for very long that this hasn't happened to. It doesn't matter if you buy something new or used, at some point it will become your reality. And I promise you it's gonna be at the most inopportune moment possible. In the middle of a snowstorm, on the side of the mountain and.... It might be pouring down rain or there may be nobody around to help you! Way to get around this one.... Just accept that it's gonna happen! Be prepared for it to happen, have a great tool box on board and extras of anything that your RV might need. If there's somebody around... Get some help! And at the end of it, know that you survived it and you're back on the road! Number 4...You're gonna pick up some hitchhikers. Not talking about humans, talking about rodents. The interesting thing about mice, is they don't care how new or expensive your RV is there's always gonna be a hole where they can slide their creepy little heads through and freak you out at the worst possible moment! On your end, all you can do is keep a clean house and have some mousetraps on board. Because eventually you're gonna use them! Number 5, Discrimination! I hate to tell you but either your age or the age of your motorhome is gonna be a problem for one of those RV parks out there. So first of, age. Under 55, we've noticed this in particular in Florida and Arizona. Not everywhere but parts of it. And.... What we did learn, was even if it's in over 55 park, they do have to let you stay for a few days. So as long as you're not wanting to spend the whole winter you can negotiate with them. Now then in terms of your motorhome, if it's over 10, then they're going to sometimes want to see pictures before they let you stay there or they won't let you stay at all! Number 6 is the one that really pisses me off and I'm talking about the reservation system in campgrounds! Now I completely understand the reservation system is a good thing. If you're,you know, planning a trip with your family, you want to know you have a place to go. But on the other side of that coin, when it's mismanaged, and places like the state of California put all their state parks on the reservation system, that's when it becomes an epic failure! There's times when you can pull into a campground and get lucky to get half the site. But you can't have it for the following night and you can't even make a reservation up until three nights out. So.... Keep that in mind especially during peak tourist season, that you're gonna have to work around that pain-in-the-butt called the reservation system!....Number 7, the perfect campsite does not exist. Now first off, everybody's definition of perfect is different. For some of you it might mean a really fancy RV resort. But.... For some people they'll look at the price tag and the fact that they have lots of neighbors and that doesn't appeal to them at all! Then you go out into the wilderness for either free or paid sites. And you have amazing views and you're across the street from the beach! But... You might have noisy neighbors or it might not be perfectly level or you find nails and trash on the ground when you get there! Kind of just the reality is: \"Suck it up buttercup!\" Because nothing perfect exists out there! You have to decide, where you're gonna compromise and what you really have to have to make it perfect for you! Number 8, Your definition of dirty clothes is going to change! Not every RV has a washer and a dryer built in. And the ones that do, they seem to take forever to completely dry your clothes! So what that means is everybody has to visit the Laundromat. Which also leads into, you have to leave your campsite! So then, you\\'ll start looking at that shirt like \"Gosh! I only wore that for a couple hours last night.\" \"I haven\\'t turned my underwear front to back yet.\" You're gonna make all kinds of excuses just so you can stay out camping. But remember, Laundry always catches up to you and I'll see you at the Laundromat! Number 9...You are going to sleep and clean yourself in some really strange places! Let's take truckstops for example. They're great for both. They tend to be very welcoming if you come and park for the night. They also happen to have, fantastic clean, hot showers! And when you first start Rving you think: \"I\\'m just gonna stay in the RV.\" But the longer you do it, the more navy showers you take, the more you realize, It's not so bad to pack your bag and walk across the street to that really nice hot campground shower that you can leave on for more than 30 seconds at a time. As far as places to park and sleep, when you close those curtains, it really doesn't matter if you're at a rest stop or a truck stop or really fancy RV park. You're home!.... Last but not Least! Number 10, Quartzite is not all it's cracked up to be! I'm not talking about the RV community, I'm talking about the dynamic that happens when you put that many people in clubs and in camps and in cliques together. It spells out \"D-R-A-M-A!\"Now don\\'t get me wrong, we've had some amazing experiences of course, met some awesome people, lifelong friendships have been built there. But there is that dark side and it just boils down to human nature. Our first year that we went to Quartzite, we got invited to this secret camp, which was designed to exclude a couple of people in the RV community. And we caught wind of this and it was like this just doesn't seem right! So our moral compass point us in the right direction there. Second year, we showed up a few days late and it turned out there are a couple people spreading horrible rumors and gossip about us! It was high school behavior at its worse! Now everybody is probably gonna make the pilgrimage to Quartzite at one point in their RV life but keep in mind it's not all struck up to be and life on the open road in smaller groups is far better!.... Alright guys! Well now you\\'ve heard our: \"10 harsh realities to RV living.\"... You know we always try to look at the bright side but we also always try to tell you guys the truth. And sometimes it's just not peaches and cream every single day out on the road. So by now, we have an entire playlist of these studio sessions.

We're preparing for the next chapter of our lives as we head overseas for some overlanding travel. So you want to make sure you subscribe to that one. Thanks for watching and we'll see you on the road!.....Bye!", "_RPFT3LwqSw": "", "jdWc3XcJ_2A": "hello and welcome back to Robeson design I'm Rebecca Robeson here in San Diego California and I'm taking you to my home today to show you the top 10 creative things I've done in my own home [Music] many of you have seen my home over the years especially during my walkthrough tours at Christmastime and you've seen this home all dolled up but what I've never showed you before is the before pictures what it looked like when we bought it 15 years ago we were looking for home and I knew when we found this one it was perfect why because it had 600 feet of office space in the front of the house and up until that time ropes and design was operating out of my garage Wow a lot of stuff before I even began my 10 list of things let me just say the obvious we removed all the wallpaper the popcorn on the ceilings we changed the textures on the walls which was like a cottage cheese that had been painted in a semi-gloss really nasty looking walls we read textured all of that and we added lighting throughout the house lighting as you know is one of my biggest things that I love we have a design session just on lighting and I do it here in my house and if you want to know more about that go to my website and check out the design sessions so I guess the best place to start in this house is at the entry  [Music]  your entry is your first impression and this entry drove me nuts it was a big rectangle it was dark and it had this low drop ceiling now I asked my contractor can't we just start the vaulted ceiling that goes in this living room and bring it on down he said it would cost a tremendous amount of money and all of my air conditioning heating would have to be rerouted way too expensive I was working on a very tight budget so this is what I did and I think it's a pretty creative idea I brought your eye up instead of feeling like this wall and this opening is dropping so low by adding this transom of molding and crown molding on top of it and painting it this off-white color it's sure to just make sure I feel like it's a higher ceiling you need to think about what's the first thing you see when you walk in now in this new home we bought it was this wall behind me and you can see that the previous owner had a curio cabinet on it while it was nice for them it wasn't as well as I wanted my home to be so what I did was I installed a 10-foot tall mirror I had them arched the top of it and then Oscar came and added eight inch thick casing all the way around it makes it look so handsome and it's actually kind of an illusion you actually think there's a room beyond there let me show you right now I have a table in front of this but if I was to move this table and you were to see this do you see how the floor runs right into the mirror and you literally feel like you could just walk right on into another room I wouldn't recommend it because it can be painful but you could  so look at this clever little idea I was able to add a little bit of natural light to this rather dingy entryway and bring some architectural interest I have loved collecting old vintage windows for years this one I got at a garage sale in my neighborhood so I asked my contractor to open up a hole in this wall and he did and look how great it looks it's hanging from a couple of just cup hooks and some a little screws on top and it is really amazing it's again in that nice dark rich stain it adds a lot and it kind of gives you a first impression peekaboo right on into the living room [Music] after years and years of designing absolutely beautiful staircases for my clients I knew that's something I wanted to do in my home the staircase as it was was very straight and it was very had a pony wall that came up to about here it was just very typical tract home in Southern California I had lease create for me I designed it but he created this beautiful custom iron railing for me I had my contractor come in and instead of having the stairs come straight down and just empty out I had him swoop it around lower that pony wall giving me more space for this beautiful iron work and then a beautiful custom sort of free-flowing design as it came down around so watch this as I walk up and down my stairs instead of coming down and just going straight there I'm able to walk into my living room my entry and the rest of my home [Music] this is really really strange I don't know if you've ever noticed this before but my wood floors downstairs are all this very very light wood well when we did the wood flooring upstairs I actually did it in the dark espresso very unusual I've never seen anyone mix their woods before and it was a little scary but I knew because I had all this dark wood in my furniture I thought maybe it could go and you know what it does it looks amazing my kitchen is not where I want it to be but thank God it's not where it used to be oh my gosh when we first saw this house for the first time I was like that kitchen is seriously scary one of the things that had in it was this bank of cabinets right across here and what it did was it really defined the kitchen as a very separate space and it was not a part of the other room I wanted to have that flow through feel this is an idea that you can use in your home and I have done it many times I then of course dropped in to pendant lights but the other thing we did is take a look at what the the lighting and the ceiling was like in this kitchen it did not do anything for my complexion or my appetite so we took that out and we put in canned lights and then around the perimeter we kept the original shape someday I'd like to redo my kitchen new countertops new cabinets all that kind of stuff but for now just ghost coating those oak cabinets to be this dark espresso with the rest of my house it was a very inexpensive cheap fix and I think it made a nice difference and one last thing that I noticed and this is kind of a clever thing I think you can tell me what you think so the cabinet that used to be here went straight across once that was gone take a look I felt like it looked I was glad that this cabinet was gone but it looked a little heavy on one side and nothing on this side so the way I sort of camouflage that issue as I took a shutter that I bought at Home Depot I stained it espresso and I just literally lean up against there and to me that kind of balanced out the chocolate cabinets on that side and a little something chocolate on this side so it's worked it's been 15 years I think we're due for a kitchen remodel what are you saying honey hmm he said yes  [Music]  do you ever look at a wall in your house and you see door after door after door and it's kind of annoying well that's how I felt in what was the family room for the previous owners  in here there was a door that went underneath the staircase a door to the powder room and a door to the laundry room the way that I fixed it is really inexpensive and it's a great way to do it to kind of make a door go away [Music] so over here I actually took the door off to the laundry room and cased it all the way around over here we use the same casein and put a beautiful solid core door right here in the bathroom so now no door door and that one I needed because it's under my staircase but you know what I did let me show you we actually textured it the same thing as the wall we took the casement off of it and the door handle it just has a little button here now do you know what this is this is a touch latch right on into my very dirty closet but anyway the concept is cool you do see the little line around here but it doesn't give you the impression of yet another door now if you're gonna do this you really want to carry off the illusion you'll notice on the floor I put in my baseboards they go actually across the door so the door that opens has baseboard and you're gonna need to do this you actually have to notch out at an angle from this baseboard to this baseboard because when this opens dad has to be able to open completely and not run into the baseboard just little things you learn as you do this kind of crazy stuff  take a look at the before picture of this wall this was a family room and the television used to sit over here you know why the television didn't sit against the wall because of this thing this Hurst that for some reason some Builder thought would be a great idea to bring it all the way across well you know what he did you just cut off I don't know 1820 inches of the room where nothing could go back against that wall I decided I was gonna make this my dining room and I wanted this to be a great focal point wall so I bought two vintage chests of drawers to use this buffets and what I did was I wanted them to go back against the wall well how can you do that with that's in the way I'll tell you how I cut the back legs off of both of these vintage pieces I mean and they weren't that expensive and it was a pretty smart and clever idea leave me a comment below and let me know if you think that's clever I do here's the other thing this fireplace I mean would I have loved to have done a paneled built-in and all this kind of stuff yes I would I made the best of what I had and that's the key I want you guys to think outside the box and think okay I can't change this but what can I do to work around it that's what I did here this is a simple plant on mantel that I got from Pottery Barn years ago but you don't get that feeling do you you know why having the wood on either side it sort of gives you that impression of this grand fireplace trust me this is no grand fireplace but it looks pretty good didn't it oh and just in case you want to know for those of you who are concerned about the legs on my buffets they're taped underneath to each buffet so if I ever moved and wanted to use these again all I have to do is draw drill pegs peg holes in them and reattach them easy-peasy  you'll often find a linen cabinet in the hallway somewhere well in this home upstairs at the top and you could still see it from downstairs was your typical linen cabinet lower cabinets upper cabinets boring so eventually I designed a beautiful linen cabinet I call it my Martha Stewart cabinet because it reminds me of something she would do it brings in all of my casements my crown molding big base molding and it's in this nice yummy kind of buttery cream color but with the glass doors what it did was it made me accountable to keep my linens clean and I made a big switch to all white in the master bedroom on this far wall which this was a long room I actually had some space so here's what I did I added an entire wardrobe system to this back wall and I completely covered it in mirror now let me show you these these doors right here this all IKEA this is my jewelry storage and I am gonna do a video just on jewelry and how I store my jewelry that's coming but every one of these opens the doors themselves come this way you can get them with mirrors on them but the drawers not so much IKEA does not make them that way so I had a mirror company come and cover the mirrors and then I had them fill in the empty space that the IKEA wardrobe system didn't cover we love it it gave my husband a place to put his clothes because you know that walk-in closet over there big enough for both of us so this answered our issue for where we gonna hang our clothes and it really added a lot to this room  [Music] hey have you guys heard the next design session is on window treatments that's right and you know what the one after that is on spring cleaning so I thought I'd get up here and kind of kill two birds with one stone and you know what not a moment too soon  here's one more clever quick and cheap idea for you in a kitchen if you wish you had an island but you don't have one I actually put this one in it's just a movable little French I don't know I got it from Ballard company for a couple of hundred dollars but it's just the right size it gives me something in the middle of this kitchen gives me a place to put stuff to chop things if I was to ever chop and to light some candles that's kind of nice don't you think  [Music] I hope you've enjoyed kind of taking a look at my house from where it was to where it is today getting the top 10 things that I think are pretty cool and fun and a lot of them are obtainable at any budget what was your favorite and what do you think maybe you could use in your home after all that's what this is all about just remember this has taken me 15 years and I still haven't arrived but I hope the one thing you take away from all of this is it's a process it's a journey and it's fun getting there I wish you guys all the luck in the world and your on decorating your own home remember the design sessions that's where I teach you everything I know the kinds of things I showed you

after buying a $13.00 ring. Woman realises. She was duped.  She looked at the woman and couldn't believe what just had been said. She thought the appraiser had just probably made a mistake. The woman had never been in a situation like that. And suppected that...neither did the appraiser. She had no idea where to turn. But, what she was told next. Made her instant royalty. An unidentified Londener was on her weekly stroll Of the Middle Sect Hospital Flea Market. West of the city...gliding past different stands. Everything looked pretty old and worn out...and with only a couple of bucks in her pocket she wanted her purchase to be worth every penny. As she was eyeing necklace on one of the stands She coulndn't help but notice the huge ring sparkling in the corner of her eye. She turn to the ring and knew that fate had brought her to it. The woman. Who who remains anonymous. As per her request. Wanted to get herself something beautiful and luxurious. Well she knew it looked like something she could never afford. She wanted it...Because it meant something more to her than just some pile of junk. She picked up the ring and looked at it for a moment. As it resonated with her...but something seemed off. Never the less she felt inexplicably drawn to it. The ring set on a mount that was of incredible size. The crystal too. The whole piece looked like jewelry from a fairy tale. ...and the woman knew she had to have it. A piece of jewelry not only she loved with all her heart. But will serve as a talisman to remind herself that one day if she worked hard enough she buy a real diamond. Little did she know every thing was about to change. She completed her purchases and spent her last remaining 10 pounds. $13.00 dollars on the incredible piece. From then on she wore the ring everyday. Everywhere... Years pass her talisman was still by her side. Being in public background she didn't need much else. So she kept this piece close to her. It made her feel like a princess. Even 30 yrs later. But one day a strange trip to the grocery store. Turned her life upside down. On a beautiful afternoon on her way home from work. The londener stopped at a nearby grocery store. She grabbed all the stuff she needed and headed to the check out  line. While waiting he could not help but notice a stranger ogling her hand. She thought this was very peculiar But she brushed off her train of thought and continue waiting for her turn. What she didn't know was that the stranger...a mysterious man Was not willing to let her out of his site. The man wouldn't stop gazing at her ring. And the woman was beginning to feel uncomfortable. Her turn finally came up she quickly paid for her products. And headed out the door.. still noticing the gaze of the man following her every move. She quickly became suspicious and feared for the worst. And that's when she noticecd he was still following her. What did this man want?...and...How could she get rid of him? The woman quickly walked towards her car. Aware that the man was still trailing her. She tried to keep him in her peripheral vision. As she tried to lose him in  the crowd but he seemed unshakable. She wondered what he wanted from her?...or was she just being paranoid. Then the gap between her and him closed and she felt him right behind her. She spun around to confront him and then he said something that completely blindsided her. The mystery man had followed her because something about her costume jewelry caught his eye. And then he asked her something that left her questioning everything. Seeing the panic on her face and with his greedy eyes never leaving her hands. He quickly asked her if she minded giving him a closer look at her ring. Not appreciating being approached so brazenly by a stranger and suppecting a scam. She merely brushed him off and hurried on her way. The woman always had her talisman by her side but one day she was in such a hurry she forgot to put it on. It had become a ritual for her wake up and put the ring on her finger. But tha day she was frazzled. She was going to be late, and as she hurried to get dress and out the door the ring was not on her finger. The ring was so incredibly valuable to her that she got off at the next stop and headed back to her house. I can't believe I left it at home...she thought...and moreso After being so paranoid about the man at the grocery store. As she climbed the stairs 2 by 2. She started in her bedroom. Her initial thought was to look for the ring where she always kept it. Nothing...it wasn't there. She knew she should of been more careful. Something was off about that man and her gut feeling told herself so too. Eyes widening, breath ragged and harsh.She turneed her bedroom upside down. She could not find her precious costume ring. But then something jogged her memory. As she entered her bathroom. There it was. The ring stood massively next to the sink in all it's glory. She put it there to remind herself to put it back on after brushing her teeth. But didn't. She was struggling to pay her bills that was no secret. All she can think about was this strange man who had an uncanny interest in her ring. He seemed to think that her crystal ring might be of some value. Who had it belonged to? She thought... The encounter with the man had been enough to take the ring to Sotheby's London. Maybe they could answer her questions and relieve her anxiety...she wondered longingly... If it had belonged to someone famous. The ring was old the silver was tarnished and there was alot of dirt on it. But what's secret was it holding A couple of anxious days later she will finally know the mind bending trurth... The suspense was killing her and suddenly a sense of dread came over her Sotheby's said they would keep it for a couple of days to run some test on the stone and her heart plummeted Then Sotheby's Jewelry in London confirmed the stones authenticity. It turned out that her ring was a giant 26 karat cushioned shaped white diamond. From the 19th Century. The Londoner couldn't believe it. Surely they made a mistake. How could she be wearing a ring of such value. All this time. The Sotheby's had all the answers. Jessica Windham who has all the auction houses jewelry department explained that a ring of such value was probably owned by someone in the Royal Family In the 19th Century And because the diamond cutting had been slightly dulled and deeper than now and days. It could trick people into thinking it's not a genuine stone. With an old styled cutting an antique cush shape the light doesn't reflect as much as it would from a modern stone cutting. Cutter worked to conserve all the weight rather than making it as brilliant as possible. The antique shape and older style had disguised it's true brilliance for all these years. They also went on to explain why it took them so long to get it authenticated and valued. We confirmed that it was indeed a diamond we tested it with the Gemological Institute of America. And that then dictated the price...said Jessica Windhelm Jessica Windham told the unidentified woman that the ring could go for as much as 350 thousands pounds. That's about $450.00 dollars if it were auctioned. That and the auctioned house continue to explain the cut of the stone. Probably would of meant that it didn't sparkle. Plus it was all dirty, no one would really think it was real. They came in with the ideal it might be real. But they had no ideal of it's value. Windham added. The Londoner knew that when she was standing at the Flea Market the ring sparkled. That what caught her attention. But maybe her talisman only shown for her. Having led a life from paycheck to paycheck. Another persons junk was her treasure and it just changed her life. The ring was sent to auction and got sold for a staggering amount of 656 thousand 750 pounds That's almost $850 thousand dollars. Not only did this great little possessions auction make her life a whole lot easier. But she finally knew that she'd been a princess all along.  But..how do you know if your costumes jewelry is valuable.", "owddK_gIyPA": "[Music]  hi everyone welcome back to my next video we're still here it's rubber Tramp around we're having a great time and I met Terry woo and saw her van and said please please please let me take a video of your van and you kindly agreed thank you so Terry woo how did you end up in the middle of nowhere in this beautiful band well I was in Austin and I made a friend that said have you are you going to RTR and I'm like oh what's our chair and so that's what's my introduction and I decided to join you and look to learn a little bit more about the people I think I've got the lifestyle down pretty well for the way I want to do it anyway my world's photography so that's been my background and my Facebook friends and my social and so now I'm expanding that to this world good so I like minded people who are living in bands yeah on the road yeah and how so how long have you been on the road full-time since May since May of this year yep i car camp since 2004 I didn't do that full time it's more vacation so I knew what I knew that kind of the lifestyle and how to deal with showers and toilets and all that kind of thing what I wanted to do and what space I wanted and so you're an outdoor person you love being outdoors and it occurred to you one day that you could combine them yes I pretty much when I went to New Zealand two years ago and I rented a car and car camp by myself I just said what am i doing I want to be out here all the time right so you're supporting yourself with your photography um I am but it's also money from selling a software development company in late 80s or late 90s so you're kind of living off savings and that's great trying to build a photography business at the same time yes I have been it's been bringing money in but not at the same rate as I spend it most of the night right I think that's most people's experience with photography yep so just nice supplement yeah I teach iPhone photography do workshops and do tours in Washington State of the Palouse area we yeah specifically I phone specifically I thought correct there's an app called Snapseed that is for editing and every phone has that available two minutes free and it's I call it Lightroom in your pocket if you're a photographer you understand what I'm I do you like what you're doing you like living in your bow very much very very much why don't we go ahead and take a look at Terry Toulouse van so Terry we will start back here and man I could just see right off the top of my head that this is some beautiful work did you hire someone to do it nope I asked my dad if he'd help me build a van he's got a great woodworking shop and so he taught me how to use the tools and all the equipment and let me go and I say I got to play for four months and just create and make art really and and it's art it does look like art it looks like a work of art it's gorgeous so of course like a lot of vans you have the bed in the back right so a few things that other people did but I didn't do it in the kitchen fashion is having the fourth footfall outdoors so I am a sports person so I have my backpack and rock climbing gear and so forth in here so it was all determined by my backpack how deep this drawer was which then determines the depth of this drawer and it also pulls out the four feet boom on and so I've got two of them that pull all the way out and then I wanted an outdoor workspace or just a place to eat from or whatever so I made sure that this height was for me when I stand in on flat ground and then I also have storage underneath here so there's plenty of storage yes storage and that's that's one thing I am and then I love crafts and so I just wanted to be able to take whatever I wanted to do on the road so I have just different odds and ends and even a sewing machine can fit in this one so and the determination of the bed height was by these bicycles I've got two in here I've got a road bike and a mountain bike and this is to be able to put the bikes together and so they're all crammed in there the beds actually four feet by six - which is unusual because I didn't put the side panels all the way across along the ribs and just left it opened and took advantage of that extra storage and length of the bed that I got all right so and what kind of van is this we haven't got 2017 Ford Transit high-top medium-length so I do spend more time in the city than I thought and so I'm able to park in downtown's without any issue which has been very nice it's yeah for a lot of people is critical yeah so yeah what's the one side my goodness this is a beautiful van it's a work of art thank you so much you have succeeded yes and your father yes I'm credit to yep he did the face frames and he did the drawer below the refrigerator there with the inlays and so forth how he did that and I took over so I did all the drawers and doors and like I said he did all the face frames his idea to do the pocket doors between the cabin here so I have those two I'll show you that later yes so I guess some of the touches that I did this is actually my nightstand basically it's got storage on the side so then you can also have storage here too so it just again another place to tuck away I'm pretty darn organized but talking about the bike tire so we can maybe start there and you if you look in there you can see that the bike tires go right into that area and of course if you're gonna build all that wood you're gonna have a beautiful cutting board yes the woods that I have in here are Maple Purple Heart and wind gay and that was by my choice my dad does some cutting boards these days and he does it with a lot of exotic woods and these are the ones that I picked from his cutting board concept mm-hmm so what I did to start with a lot of people asked me is when I knew what Van I was gonna buy I got foam core board and I did a quarter inch scale model so I knew how I wanted the van to be that counter tops 34 and a half inches rather than the standard 36 I wanted to build it for me one of my favorite pieces is my pull out pantry this for those of you who have done build yourself you know nothing's square in here so it's actually got a 13 inch track on the top and a 22 inch track on the bottom took me a week to design and build this it's just kind of crazy but I really love it turned out really pretty I think really nice gorgeous and practical yes that's so that's the one thing I'm seeing everywhere here is its beauty with practicality perfectly combined thank you yeah that same concept the practicalities in this drawer where I did double layers and I the stove works off of the one pound propane bottles so I didn't have to vent anything and so the propane bottles at the bottom of this and then I have all my kitchen supplies mm-hmm very very practical another thing that I did that before I left home and went to my dad's I decided all the stuff I wanted to bring I went into the bathroom and I said okay what what do I want to have and I made boxes and so we built actually the cabinet's two fifties boxes so everything was organized and ready to go mm-hmm and you know you're saying everything is curved you can see the curve right here yeah well that is well cut thank you that is really well kinda having done a little bit of that and never made anything that well cut I I can really admire that thank you very much and here again just to give you idea when we say nothing is curved so I do have a microwave in here I'm not using it so I'm gonna probably pull it out I'm just not finding the need for it like I thought I have 270 watts of power on a ceiling for the roof for my solar panels and I am using the Yeti 1250 before they did the lithium batteries so this is another little fun area that I shot my 8 this is actually the last piece I built and I wanted to have a rock garden I collect rocks all the time and I used to bring him home and now I bring him home and I are able to just put them in these jars and have my rock garden travel with me so I don't have any locks on my uppers they're just self closing hinges I do have the lips on my shelves so that helps a lot I've got four plug in power so 110 plugins with some of them have the USB also in the in the bedroom so I'm able to plug in my cell phone at night and be sure that I don't forget to charge it mm-hmm and so there's one at the desk one in the kitchen one in the bedroom and there was one up in this cupboard for the microwave this is my office what I did inside of here is I put mag steel and so they're magnetic so you're able to just take whatever you collect along the way and put it and hide it away rather than having it cluttery really brilliant idea yeah so what I did with the closet is my dad said I wasn't thinking I was gonna get one he's like we can make that work so what we did is let the clothes hang so they are in your foot area but since you're under the covers most of the time you don't even notice them and then we just did the dowels at the top and just bought these are actually Walmart hangers take off the top and then just put in a hook that we've just built so they're nice and tucked up rather than having the longer hanger I did here I did hear somebody talk about there's ones that you can buy that are short but these ones seem to work well and you're one of the few people that I've ever seen tuck your feet underneath cabinets I do okay I'm surprised more people don't it's so much more efficient right right that's what mate allowed me to have a bed that's six too so that was really yeah this is actually my dirty clothes drawer and this is storage right now it does I can put a porta potti there I made sure that I could do the composting one if I wanted to and there goes the pump so speaking of which I have to ask how are you going to bathroom um right now I did do a blog post on that and people asked you have a toilet but they don't get past that point and I said that pretty much in if I'm in the city I'll park next to a place and be sure I pee before I go to sleep and get close enough that I'll use it the facilities in the morning hand if I'm out in the nature I'll scoop and bury so cat holes yeah this is what you're primarily doing yeah I think that's perfectly legal nothing wrong with that and so showering do not have a shower in sight but I do have a shower outside so I can do that truck stops community centers so you know if with the wall there you would think it would be small and feel small but not the wind mirror makes a huge difference I think so too and to me when I put the wall here I only put it up when I'm stationary like this or at night when I'm for privacy so there are insulated wall panels that are actually pocket doors so they do puck behind the driver's seat and I'll just demonstrate that real quick here right now I'm feeling a ton of heat pouring out of the cab too so it actually keeps it cooler or different areas and if I do in the morning need some heat you open that up if you let the Sun in your cabin it's instant warmth and then I did great along the track I just so I didn't stub my toes I do have the way to keep them so they don't rock back and forth when I'm driving nice and compact in there the most important thing you can do to keep your van comfortable heat or cold you separate from the cab okay another thing that I did is I've been collecting lapel pins for years and you know they get thrown in a drawer and I'm like I want to start displaying them so I actually have a cork board behind there and I glue gun them instead so they don't rattle so there's no rattling issues at all one thing I didn't and there's tons of storage rocks and so do you have hot water you have a pump owner we do not I think I mentioned I have 13 gallons of fresh and 13 gallons of greywater so and tanks underneath tanks are sitting right here just it's river i RV tanks just right hand whirring yep and fills of course from the outside yep  site so I have a shower on this side I have shore power and then I have my water intake and so you are plumbed you have your pump and your plumbing to the sink you have have a working sink here yep so you could shower you could wash your hair in the sink it might be cold but it wouldn't be too bad no not at all so there you know the sponge bath definitely do happen yeah always take sponge baths in between guests in their showers yep very much in my refrigerator is 110 it pulls the most power of anything I do have the inverter that I'm able to plug into the eddy so if you want to see that system looks like down here this is a gold 0 Yeti yep and I did have the extra battery in the back and right now I'm bringing in about a hundred and one watt support from the sunshine I do have so this has comes from the roof from the panels themselves this is the 110 that goes to a breaker box and then I have the fuses for the 12-volt my dad's a retired firefighter so we made sure everything was safe and neat and tidy if I do have the buddy heater is that cold mornings when I was in Austin but I do find even just my body heat in here does amazingly keep me warm and unless you're going below 30 yeah and so you insulated the walls yep I use the insulation all the way around put it doubled where I could that's not done work in progress always everyone I've ever talked to said nope not done well I have we covered everything is there anything we missed you love your life you're happy with what you're doing when I first started car camping I kind of kept but well I did keep it to myself as far as social media goes didn't want the stigma of sleeping in my car and possibly being homeless kind of concept because that wasn't the deal at all so until a friend that was a good photographer friend he said you need to talk to tell your story and you'll inspire other women and I have and it's been really touching when I have gotten emails that said slept in my car last weekend and I was inspired by you think well speaking of which is there anything you would like to share with the audience YouTube I do Facebook I have mainly Instagram I started the build so I post it every day so you can see the whole build on Instagram and it is artistic adventurer van and I also did a few YouTube videos I plan on doing more when I decide I want to sit down for a minute rather than visit with people and everything else but I did do the beginning of the build which includes the mock-up that I talked about and the insulation and that's also artistic adventurer van on YouTube so those are the best ways to do that I'm also a blogging on Terry Lou blog.com and it's ter Aiello you blog so Terry Lou I just so appreciate your sharing your home with us in your story that's so inspiring folks I hope you're inspired if you're not I can't imagine why not and if you've learned something and been inspired I hope you'll like us on YouTube subscribe to the channel and we'll talk to you later  [Music]", "T5YlSB-zgvE": "Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say you need a little bit of lemon juice. You usually take your lemon and you cut it in half then you use a little bit of lemon juice and then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got all this lemon leftover so you put it in the fridge or something. And then when you come back it looks like this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all rotten and dry and dehydrated and just rancid, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want to use it anymore and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard and crunchy like this one. There must be a better way to preserve your lemon and still get your juice. Well there is, this is how, you take your lemon and you roll it and then you want to take a sort of pin and just poke in the bottom in the lemon, the exact bottom where the point is here, and then you squeeze and all the lemon juice you want just pours out. Now the great thing is you made a very small little hole in it now so oxygen can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get into it and make it rot so it will stay fresher for longer. Make Butter Spreadable Sometimes you want to spread some butter but when you take it out of the fridge the butter is super hard and really hard to spread. This is super annoying, so what do you do? Usually you just pop it in the microwave but the issue with this is it always seems to over melt the butter and make it into a big soupy mess just like this. That can be very annoying so there must be a better way. Well there is, take a cheese grater and then you just grate your butter stick. Yes that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, grate your butter stick. Now that has two added benefits, one it delivers energy to the butter by the grating motion which makes it a bit softer, and also the higher surface area makes it softer quicker also. Lastly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in this funny interesting spaghetti like consistency which now is super spreadable so you can just spread it on whatever you want and you have nice soft butter. Success! Easy Potato Peeling You just take a knife and a potato and you put them together and just twirl the potato around while you cut into the skin just softly in a circular motion, then you take it and you cook it like you normally would. Now by cooking the skin with the potato you actually infuse the potato with more flavor because most of the flavor of the potato is actually in the skin so you get more potatoy mash. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cooked it, you can just pull the skin off just like this and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much more efficient, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste any potato and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much quicker than peeling it. Peeling Hardboiled Eggs Take a hardboiled egg, place it in a jar, add a little bit of water to cover then you just place your hand over the jar and shake it like mad. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done which is pretty soon, you just take out and the shell is basically fall off the boiled egg and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that easy to remove. Alright, trick number five staying on the same shaking idea this is a garlic bowl and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to place it in a jar and again shake like mad. Okay, once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done that for a little bit then you just pop it out and you just remove some of the husks because they will get in the way. Once you have removed the husks just put all these garlic cloves back inside, alright. Put the lid back on and again shake like crazy, keep shaking, just carry on shaking. And now you just pop it out and all the skins have separated from the cloves. You can just pick them away and put them to one side then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got these beautiful little garlic cloves and if any of the skin is still on you can put them in the jar and shake again or just easily pull it off very easily like that. Make Bread Fresh Again! I hate when you have old bread and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super hard and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it anymore. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I always keep my bread inside a plastic bag so it stays soft, just like this one here and then you can still resuscitate here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got soft bread but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very, very old and to resuscitate it all you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to need is just some water. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put this here so I can pour some water over it, basically just pour the water over it and pour it on the bottom also and then you want to place it into an oven at 180-degrees Celsius, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 356-degrees Fahrenheit. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to leave it in there for about three minutes and after three minutes have passed then you just want to turn it around and then hit it up for another three minutes. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still soft or not done enough just leave it a bit longer. But once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done you just pull it out and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crispy again and crunchy just like it was from the bakers and the inside is nice and soft and tender and steamy, just delicious fresh bread and this is like an old bread, this is like a week old really. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super usable again and just great to use, so give this a try at home and let me know what you think. Crazy Way to Open Wine For this trick let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assume you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find your bottle opener but you do happen to find your blow torch. Well just take it and turn it on then aim it at the little air gap in between the cork and the wine and what will happen is it will heat up the air and make it expand pushing the cork out the top in a nice little explosive bang \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just like this. Success! Alright now you turn your blow torch off and pour out your wine like you usually would and enjoy it. There we go, done! The Black Egg Alright so this next trick is called the Black Egg and for this you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just going to crack and egg into a bowl and then separate out the yolk. The simplest way to do this is just with a spoon, you scoop it out like this and just pop it in the other bowl. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to add some black cuttlefish ink but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the savory fishy taste this has you can always just use black food coloring and just mix it together like this. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mixed it together then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to fry it. Here I am going to put some oil on a pan and here I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pop it in. One thing that happens is when you beat egg whites they become a bit more runny so they will spread out more than you want. If that happens just simply push the sides in like this just to keep in an egg sort of shape. Alright now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to add your egg yolk back in, so just add it on like this and put it into position where you want it to be. Once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done cooking there you go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 simple, done. Just cook it like you would a normal sunny side up fried egg. This is just a very simple way to make something mundane look very, very different and interesting. I hope you enjoy it! Testing Eggs for Freshness Sometimes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some eggs and you just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fresh or not. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of impossible to look at an egg and know if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh even though most grocery stores these days do print the date on them just like so, but sometimes these get rubbed off because of some other reason that we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Now in that kind of case what do you do to figure out if an egg is fresh or not? Well here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a simple trick, just drop your egg in some water and the fresh ones will sink to the bottom just like this and the un-fresh ones will float to the top just like so. Now the great thing about this trick is you can do it with multiple eggs if you happen to have a big enough tub and then you can easily detect which eggs are fresh and which eggs are no good. For example here, these two are no good I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to dispose of them and cook with the rest. Super Poached Eggs Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to show you an amazing new way to make poached eggs even better. Start off by taking an egg and separating it like this, now you want to take some basil and just finely chop it up, so cut it like this and chop it up like that. Now you can use any other herb you like but the combination of what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m showing you is pretty good. Take your basil and add it to your egg whites, just like this and then add a little bit of mozzarella cheese, but you can add any other cheese you like or any other ingredients for that matter. You can put little bits of mushroom or little bacon bits, whatever you like with eggs. Once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mixed up take another bowl, take some cling film dent it into the bowl then spray it with oil so you can un-stick it later. Place half your mixture into the bowl like this. Now place your egg yolk and cover it up with the rest of the mixture just like so. Okay now to close it up, you just bring up the sides and you can tie this into a knot or use a little piece of string and tie a knot around it, or you can use one of these simple cheap little clamps and just clamp it shut. You can get this everywhere, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no point mentioning it. Now to cook it, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to place it in some simmering water for five minutes to get a nice runny egg yolk, but you can cook it a little bit longer if you want to have a more hard egg yolk. Okay so once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done just take it out, and then you just un-clamp it and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to place it here on some bread and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delicious like this but you can also add it in say an Eggs Benedict recipe or some salad, or just anywhere you want to use a poached egg. This is just way better and more tasty. END", "Bntj6OCe2_g": "From the possible site of the legendary Garden of Eden to an island that may be covering an Alien Base -- Today we look at the 9 Most Mysterious Islands On Earth Number 9. \"Island of Socotra\" Off the coast of Somalia in the Indian ocean is an island that seems as though it belongs on another planet. Socotra Island has long been theorized as a location for the biblical Garden of Eden, and just by looking at pictures of it you can see why. The island is home to several species of plants that are can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found anywhere else on Earth. There are the Dr. Seuss looking Adenium socotranum which have big bulbous trunks and tiny gnarly branches that sprout from their tops and bear flowers that are a marvelous shade of pink. There odd appearance makes them kind of look like giant root vegetables. Then there are the Dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blood Trees which look like perfect natural umbrellas. The have trunks that resemble that of an average tree but their thick tightly bunched branches shoot upwards and form a mushroom like crown. Socotra is also home to three geographically unique species of bird: the socotra sunbird, socotra grosbeak and socotra starling. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many other creatures that inhabit the island other than that of bats and insects and the last time it was home to man was around the year 100 A.D. Adding to the mystery, the island has been the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the years. Number 8. \"Palmyra Atoll\" Though technically not an island but an atoll that formed from coral the mysterious nature of Palmyra Atoll cannot be ignored. Also known as Palmyra Island, the breathtakingly beautiful ringlet sits between American Samoa and Hawaii. Though it is full of lush vegetation and appears unblemished by man the island has long be the subject of superstition and folktales. There have been several cases of violent shipwrecks and mysterious disappearances of ships on and around the island. Those who have observed the island and survived to tell their tale have claimed having seen some extremely bizarre sights like that of floating lights, ghosts and sea monsters. It is also reported to be the home of an incredible amount of sharks who may have developed a distinct taste for humans. There is also the story of lost Incan treasure that may still be on the island. These tales and others which cannot be discussed do to their graphic nature have made Palmyra the stuff of legend amongst sailors and Pacific Islanders for centuries. Number 7. \"Vulcan Island\" Vulcan Island in the Philippines isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily an island that is shrouded in mystery but it definitely is a mindblowing locale. On the northern Philippine island of Luzon there sits a lake named Taal and in that lake there is an island called Taal Volcano, inside this island is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest crater lake and inside of this lake there sits yet another island, known as Vulcan Island. Not only is Vulcan Island one of the most fascinating of natural recursion it happens to be located on one of the most active volcanoes in the entire Pacific Ocean. Because of this fact it is incredibly dangerous to visit Vulcan Island as it has been quaking and bubbling since 1991. Number 6. \"Easter Island\" The world renowned Easter Island still attracts tourists, anthropologists and archaeologists to this day who are both perplexed and in awe of the statues left behind by the ancestors of the native Rapa Nui peoples. Though the mysteries behind these statues, called Moai are now mostly solved, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only puzzle that is confounded visitors to the small island off of Chile. Scientists recently answered one of the biggest questions surrounding the Moai which was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow did the Rapa Nui move these massive stone idols?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 They found out that these statues were specifically designed to have pot bellies so that they could be rocked back and forth until they were eventually wiggled to where they wanted them. But the mystery that still remains unsolved doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do with the Moai but rather the people that built them. The Rapa Nui have been found to have a completely separate genetic heritage to that of nearby native South American peoples. In fact their closest genetic relatives actually came from Pacific Islanders that live near Southeast Asia. So what is the mystery? Well despite being located in the Pacific, Easter Island is still thousands of miles away from the Rapa Nui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearest relatives. So how did they get there? And how did they build such advanced structures and invent their own agricultural system at such an early period in history despite being geographically isolated from civilizations with similar advancements? Number 5. \"The Island of The Dolls\"-The Mexico City borough of Xochimilco is steeped in Mexican history. Because it has long been the hub that connects the various canals and lakes of Mexico it has been the cultural melting pot of the country. One particular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfloating garden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the canals of Xochimilco may be eerie to outsiders but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s origins come from a caring place, in line with Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tradition of honoring those who have passed from this life to the next. The legend goes like this, one day a man found the body of a young girl who had met with a tragic fate in the waters of one of the canals. When he later returned to the spot he found her he spotted a doll floating in the water and believed it to have belonged to the girl. In order to pay tribute to the girl he tied the doll to a nearby tree. As the days passed he still felt like the girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at rest so he started to bring more dolls and hang them on the trees. Though no one knows if this story is more than myth, it has become a tradition to hang dolls on the trees of the floating garden which is now known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLa Isla de las Munecas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Island of the Dolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Although this tradition comes from the heart, it is still quite a frightening sight as the dolls are in various states of decay and some have even told tales of them coming to life. Number 4. \"Poveglia Island\"-Just off the coast of Venice, Italy lies Poveglia Island which may have one of the most twisted and horrifying histories of any island on Earth. During the devastating Bubonic Plague outbreak of the 14th century the government of Venice decided to try and quarantine the infected by sending them to Poveglia Island where they would live out the rest of their days. Because of this, even after the plague subsided the site became basically a national lazaretto and used anytime an outbreak of disease occurred. Poveglia would being to serve a new purpose in the 1920s when a mental hospital was built on it and the terrors that the patients were subject to at the hands of their caretakers only added to the haunting history of the island. The island has since fallen into dangerous level of disrepair and the Italian tourism bureau technically has forbidden people from visiting unless they go through an extensive application and interview process. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped ghosthunters and thrill-seekers alike from finding alternative ways to sneak onto the spooky island. Number 3. \"Isla Bermeja\" From the 1500s up until the late 1900s there existed an island off the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, at least according to maps there was. The islet of Bermeja was long used as the geographical boundary for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section of the Gulf but several mapping expeditions in the 20th century that went looking for the island frankly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. There are several theories as to how an island could appear on maps for the better part of four hundred years but then suddenly disappear. Most modern day experts believe that the island never existed at all and may have been the result of a cartographic mistake that went uncorrected. Some say that the island, which was described as being the color of strawberry blonde hair, did exist but sank into the ocean. This theory is backed up by British maps dating back to the 1840s which describe the island being slowly swallowed by the sea. However, there are those who believe that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance and the fact that it had political significance are not mere coincidence. Because the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most oil-rich regions on Earth some have theorized that the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence was only perpetuated by the Mexican government in order to strategically extend their claim. On the flipside, there are also conspiracy theorists who believe the island did exist but was destroyed by the United States government for the same reason. Other conspiracies claim that the island still exists but that the evidence has been wiped from maps due to it being the site of top-secret activities. Number 2. \"Floating Eye Island\" While surveying the Parana Delta of northern Argentina in 2016 with the hopes of finding the perfect setting for his upcoming film, Argentinian filmmaker Sergio Neuspillerm found one of the most peculiar places in the world. Deep in the misty marshlands Sergio came upon a lake that appeared to be shaped like a perfect circle. Not only that, but there was an island in the lake that was exactly the same shape and it filled up the majority of the lake, leaving only a thin ring of water around it. Sergio was fascinated with the island that would come to be called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and quickly returned with a small research party. His team reported some strange findings. They found that the island was actually floating in the water and appeared to rotate around the lake on its own axis. They also say that the water was astonishingly cold and clear and the bottom of the lake was significantly harder than the rest of the ground in the area. Because of these mysterious observations Sergio decided to scrap the initial film project he was working on in favor of shooting a documentary on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Since the word got out on Floating Eye Island several conspiracy theories with it at the center have arisen. The most popular of these is that the island is covering a secret alien base. Number 1. \"Diego Garcia\" In the middle of the Indian Ocean is Diego Garcia Island which has been shrouded in conspiracy. The island, which is part of the Chagos Archipelago, was uninhabited when it was settled by French colonists in 1793 who brought hundreds of slaves to the islands to work their plantations. The island would eventually fall under British control as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. After slavery was abolished, the freed slaves (who had established their own cultural identity) stayed at the island and continued to till the land. But the Chagossians, as they had come to be called, were forced out of their home in 1971, in order to make way for a United States Naval Base. The US and UK had come to an agreement allowing the US Navy to take control of the island, but the base that the Navy wanted to build required the Chagossians to be unwillingly relocated. The arguably unethical methods the United States used to get the islanders to comply, such as slowly cutting off their supplies or euthanizing their pets would only add depth to the conspiracy theories that would subsequently arise about the island.", "uWBz9kl-hTA": "hello this is Kirk Rotella Dobey inactions director of education and this is our 2014 brick making process we start off by running some local soil through a 1/2 inch screen that's what I'm doing right here it's good to break the soil down a little bit smaller for adobe brick making and mortar here's a close-up of the soil again it's local soil from the Santa Fe River Basin and we're purchasing it from a local gravel yard and running it through the screen to get it ready this is an example of one of our mixing stations we're using these feed troughs and they're on a stand so everything's at waist height which makes it very comfortable and we're using these three gallon hard rubber buckets instead of shovels we use shovels to fill them up with our materials but we can get a more accurate mix if we use buckets because everyone's shovel is a different size and here's a shot of the mixing station again we're using garden hose to actually mix the mix inside this station and we have these rain barrels where we store water we're trying to conserve water and so this way we don't waste water this is these other rain barrels that we're using so we're getting ready to do a mix now this is Mike Lopez our executive director we start by adding water to the mixing station we're going to add four of these buckets and there are three gallons we have twelve gallons of water total we're just going to add and we like to add the water first because it makes it easier to mix then if we put the dry material in first and then the water it's harder to mix and we tend to have the dry mix sticking to the bottom of the station so here's our last bucket so we have 12 gallons of water in the station we're using straw we like to add straw to our adobe's this straw has gone through a leaf mulcher one one pass through the leaf mulcher and now we're going to use those same buckets using the same bucket for all of our measurements we're going to add two buckets notice how we're not really compacting we're just going to fill the bucket loosely with the straw to the top and then we'll add that to our mix so so far we have 12 gallons of water and that is three gallons now we have six gallons of chopped straw and it's always good then to get the straw a little bit wet in the mix so we're using the garden hoe here just to get the straw distributed in the mix otherwise it tends to clump up a little bit notice how comfortable it is to work at this height this is one of the reasons why we chose this system because we're working with a lot of volunteers and we want to keep things up off the ground now Mike's adding our screened soil so this is our clay rich soil of course we need clay and this soil has a pretty decent clay content and Mike's going to fill up a bucket we'll show you how we do this we fill it all the way to the top and then we just strike it with our hand like so and then that gets put into the mix and for our for this size mix we're doing seven buckets of the soil the clay rich soil I'm calling it now this is a one of the things we like to point out is it's good to have one person at least one person mixing while the mix is going in otherwise it tends to clump up at the bottom so here we have now Saul seven of our clay rich soil buckets in the mix and Mike and I are just a jet\u00c3\u00a9 ting the mix hydrating the clay making sure the clay the clay is our glue so we want to make sure that it's nicely distributed in the water and then the second ingredient is the sand we're using washed concrete's and it's very coarse or a little rocks all the way from the little rocks down to small grain sizes that's very important for making a strong earth and building materials and here also we're going to add seven buckets of the mix so it's a 50/50 mix 50% of our clay rich soil and 50% of our washed concrete's and a coarse sand of course your soil mix might be different so Mike's adding especially with the sand it's very important that you have at least one person mixing while you're adding this and because the sand tends to clump up at the bottom of the mix and here we are now we have all of our sand added so we have four buckets of water two buckets of straw seven buckets of clay rich soil local soil and now seven buckets of washed concrete sand coarse sand and it gets a little bit difficult to mix but it's it's it is considered a wet mix and I'm just showing you here with the action cam this movement of two people working at a station and getting the mix getting the sand evenly distributed getting everything evenly distributed that's what we want it's quite easy because we are doing a wet mix and we'll talk more about that later and then the last step is just to go in with your hands real quick check the edges make sure there are no clumps it's easy to miss clumps along the edges here's one that Mike found and which is going to break it up with his hand now that's sort of the last step in the mixing process and this mix is now ready to go out into the field into our forms  here are our forms we've made fifty forms there are six bricks each so we have a total of 300 bricks that we can lay down at one time they're made with two by fours and they're screwed together brick size of course in New Mexico is ten by fourteen by three and a half so we lay these brick forms out on the ground like so two together and a lot of times people wet them we don't let them we're using such a wet mix that it's not really necessary this is our screed tool it's just a piece of fence on a welded onto a onto a handle and now we're transferring out the mud mix this is how we're doing it with our volunteers as well we're keeping it all very low-tech we're transferring the mud mix using those same three gallon buckets to the wheelbarrow and we want to go with about a half a wheelbarrow load if we go any more it's too heavy for our volunteers and we risk tipping them over and then the wheelbarrows go out into the field like so the forms are waiting and then we'll simply start on one end one for brick side of the form and we'll dump the mix out into the form normally we have a team of people doing this and then there's a little bit of hand work just to get sometimes we spill a little bit on the sides notice how wet the mix is there are two ways of making Adobe's one way is to do a very stiff mix and then pour the mix into the form and pull the form right away this is the wet method where it would not be possible to pull a form right away we have to let it sit for a few hours or in our case we let it sit overnight and now mike is going to take our screed and simply distribute the mud mix over these four sections of the brick form usually that's about what a wheelbarrow will fill about four sections and then without fussing too much we're just going to strike the top of the mud one or two times and just create more uniform bricks by getting the surface level we'll do that on both sides and again normally we have a team of people working here one or two people working on the form and it maybe goes a little bit quicker and that's pretty much it for this section we're just going to keep repeating this process bringing wheelbarrow laughter we're barrel in and dumping it on top of the forms usually with our volunteers we have you know two or three teams of people working on sets of form so we can lay out 36 bricks at one time and Mike's going ahead and distributing the mud again with the screed you could do this by hand as well or you could use little hand squeegees but we found out that this larger screed works really well and again once we get it distributed we do a simple pass over the top striking the top to give ourselves more uniform bricks  so now we've got our form entirely full this is a little extra step that we like to do especially New Mexico in the summertime it's quite warm and sometimes that Sun or the wind will dry the bricks too quickly and they tend to crack a little bit so we want to keep our clay content relatively high that makes the bricks a little bit more water resistant and so for that reason we add just a little bit of water over the top on very warm days or very windy days and then Mike is actually going in with his hands here and just working the water into the surface a little bit we do not really want to smooth out the surfaces we want rough surfaces that actually makes it easier when we start building adobe walls with these bricks rough surfaces grab the mortar better and Mike is just finishing up here doing some final cleanup work and making sure that things are nice nicely distributed so we have our 12 bricks laid down here and we just repeat this process throughout the day and like I said before we can lay out about 300 bricks now this is these are some bricks that we made the day before so we're just showing you how we pull the forms off the next day you can see that the bricks are still wet on the sides there for the tops are dry so it's quite easy with two people this size form you want to have two people simply grab it on the ends and it pops right off and again these bricks were not these forms were not pre wet and because the mix is so wet is relatively easy to pull the forms off the next step is to carefully stand the bricks up on end so usually we can do this the next day depending on the weather within one day or two days maximum we can stand the bricks up and we want to get them up like this as soon as possible because this will help them to dry out and Mike's using this little hand hoe just to scrape if we do this scraping stage right now you could use a trowel you could use a piece of metal Mike's using this little garden hoe just quickly scrape the bottom and we'll have more uniform bricks and then once we have them dry in the field for about a week we we like to put them on pallets like so we can put thirty ten three rows of ten that's thirty bricks and then we can go the opposite way so we're getting 60 bricks on the pallet and normally we put five more flat on the top notice how we leave a little bit of space between them and then we go ahead and wrap these with shrink wrap and they're ready to be picked up by a little forklift and put on a flatbed truck and delivered to one of our recipients which are normally nonprofit organizations thank you and take care", "0RWJEOScToE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey how you doing Jax Califronia here and you're cooking with Jack welcome back to the show forgive my black hat my yellow one is still a little dirty from my son's little antics with the you know the the big top cupcake scene yeah you know how that turned out anyway I still have some some cupcake cream in my eye so that hat is drying I had to wash it but we are back with another episode it's time to start getting back into some some lessons that's right we've done product reviews we've gone on field trips we've done we've done specialty holiday events right now I want to start teaching you guys some some tips and tricks okay so every so often I'm gonna do an episode that's gonna teach you something whether it's parboiling or whether it's butterflying or whether it's just things that you see on cooking shows that you're like what are they talking about alright here's a little trick right now for those of you who eat steak or any kind of a cut of beef or any meat whatsoever I guess this would work on I've only tried it on steak so far okay it's called the poor man's filet mignon and what that does it's a way of taking a really and I'm gonna be just honest a really tough cheap piece of garbage steak okay and making it tender and amazing falls apart I mean you could probably pull it apart with your fingers instead of a knife and a fork so we're gonna show you this it's really cool my brother called me one day goes Jack Jack here I sending a link check this out online there's this cool method of tenderizing your meat before you cook it and it only takes about between one to two hours depending how thick your meat is it could be as little as 15 minutes so let's uh let's show you how I went to the store and I bought the cheapest piece of garbage they had on sale yeah so cheap all right it was a dollar ninety-nine a pound it's all I could find there was ninety nine cents a pound I would've brought that home but it's called what is a select beef cross rib roast I don't know what that is I don't know bones in it anyway let me show you how to do this we're gonna do a side-by-side comparison I had the butcher take a thick piece and slice it right in the middle so we have two pieces of the same mistake all right so there's no question about this test if one comes out more tender than the other they're from the same steak okay all right so let's take a look all right to clean pans we're gonna open up these steaks but one and eat don't forget to wash your hands you haven't washed your hands now's a good time to go wash your hands all right  okay once again I took one piece of meat and I had the butcher slice it right down the middle okay so there would be the same cut of meat ah beautiful I love beef as you can tell it just looks good so many things you can do with it you can cook it a million different ways this is not a good cut of beef okay I'm just telling that right now okay next thing you're gonna do is you're going to take sea salt or kosher salt and that's a very coarse salt and we're gonna take that we're gonna cover one of them completely with sea salt all right so let's do that right now okay so we're gonna do this now the rule is this find out how thick your steak is ours it's about an inch and a half okay so you're gonna have to leave this on an inch is an hour so an inch and a half would be an hour and a half once again every inch is an hour you leave this salt on if it's half an inch then you do half an hour quarter of an inch quarter of an hour all right don't be afraid to put too much on because we're gonna wash this right off when we're done but this is going to do something to the meat it's really interesting there we go I got the whole thing covered a little bit more down here all right there we go I don't know why this works I'm sure something you do and you can write me in and tell me but what's gonna happen is it's gonna pull the moisture out of this meat and it's also going to do something to the protein molecules it's gonna break them down and what's gonna happen is this simple piece of meat as you can see it's pretty it's pretty tough see how it doesn't there's no openings okay you can pull it apart okay this is gonna open up the meat it does something for the protein molecules I don't know the science to it I just know it works and I'm just gonna show you guys right now so we're gonna let this set for let's break out my measuring tape that is about you know what that's about a an inch and a quarter so we're gonna do an hour and 15 minutes okay I'll be back in an hour and 15 minutes to show you exactly one pock mouth notice there's no moisture or water in there just the salt no moisture or water in this one all right let's check this out in an hour and 15 minutes you're watching the cooking with Jack show we'll be right back right after this message hey how you doing jack sky Lonnie here just want to tell you about my line of sauces they're called the best sauces you'll ever taste that's right it's called the best barbecue sauce you'll ever taste here's the best hot barbecue sauce over taste the best teriyaki sauce you'll ever taste and the best gourmet seasoning you'll ever taste all of them come with a money-back guarantee and if you live in the United States of America I give you free shipping I'm pleased to announce that my friends in the great white north in Canada I have now set up an order page for Canadian orders I don't do free shipping but now Canadians can order the sauces too go check it out go to the best sauces com I'll see you there and now back to the cooking with Jack show it's been an hour and 15 minutes and you can see that all the salt has has really become moist it's pulling it's drawing all the water out of it you can also see if you'd if we turn this let me move this one over a little bit if you turn this you could see like the salt a lot of moisture down in there collecting and you can see where the water is coming out of the steak it's just it's just coming right out of the bottom so it's doing something to this meat so we're going to take both of these and get them prepared for cooking all right first thing you do is rinse the entire day of salt there we go get all the salt off it and look but you notices see all those openings look at all those groove openings it's starting to kind of kind of pull apart a little bit here it's really penetrated the mean get a good rinse now you can see it's it's right kind of very loose feeling I'll show you at the other at the table okay let's look up difference in the meat okay take a look at how this this has been not treated how it kind of just looks straight out of the butcher counter okay and look at this this is a lot more falling apart you can already see the grooves look at the separation you see that separation right there the separation right in there all these grooves that are created it just seems to be falling apart in my hands it's not quite as firm yeah we turn it the right way there we go there you go okay seems to have opened up the meat it's really interesting so there you go now we take these out we're gonna grill these now once this is clean of salt season both of these is however you want I'm gonna season them up then take them out to the grill bring them right back and then we're gonna do a taste test see if this opened up and got more tender than this one okay you just came off the grill I want to show you some similarities and some differences okay now I noticed while cooking these these were cooked on over their own flame each one had a flame underneath it on the barbecue they were cooked identically the same position same amount of time I pulled them off but the weird thing is the untreated one looks like it curled up a little bit right on this end and I don't we can see it but it kind of curled up and it kind of looked like it cooked overcooked or got well done but look at this one right here this one's interesting because this still I like my steak rare this looks rare and this looks well-done they look completely different if they look like they were quickly different completely different times so one more thing I want to do before I want to lift these up and which one has more juice before we cut into it okay okay this one definitely has more juice than this one but we're gonna cut into these bad boys right now let me bring over a plate this is the one season with the salt this is one not seasoned with the salt I'm gonna cut right into him we're gonna see exactly how they cooked oh yeah nice and rare okay that's beautiful let's take a look at this one same spot same thing you'd they're both beautiful let's take a look now and see let's see if one's more tender than the other I'm gonna try and rip this tear this meat open with my fingers it's pretty easy little nervy I like that was a little tougher than I thought but you can do it now let's go over here and look at this same spot that goes right through Wow that was beautiful that was a lot easier now I think if you left the salt on a little bit longer you would even have a better a better tenderizing procedure all right so here's the deal um take a piece of meat here Wow I know what I'm having for dinner there's one piece there don't want the same size here so we try this right now we let the meat set it should be perfect this is the untreated good seasoning Wow lots of pepper forgive me mmm I love black pepper okay it's really got a lot of flavor but it immediately toughen up almost all the juices out of it and it's now becoming harder to show now the treater one mmm this is more like a New York steak I think we've upgraded to a New York steak right here mmm it's breaking up real easy it definitely makes a difference I've done this before but I had to share with you guys mmm delicious I'm gonna get a little a1 I'm gonna sit down with these steaks and we're gonna have a conversation go you guys try it out write me send me pictures tell me I'm not lying please all right I'll see you on the next cooking with Jack take care [Music] [Applause]", "-UOdlgd2JsU": "", "eLsuwNfRU_8": "[Music]  in Salt Lake City the kind of old-world so you take them an idea like The Container house now I took this into them it took them know first of all 60 days before they finally realized I was building them out of containers  most people get scared with looking at construction desks they go in there and the guy says it'll cost you hundreds of thousand dollars to even do something even to think about doing that in the engineering and I looked at and I said God you know no it's not and he started argue with me and I said look I built the thing in my driveway would you like to come see it and I got myself busted because I had done it my driveway they liked the idea and I'm always trying to do something in a creative means for our city I keep looking at how we can take this to the next level and get it to the point where affordability using small little building yourself style okay and this is just a plain welded plate so you have your two by sixes okay this goes down construction project and some of the designs I'm coming up with is taking a conventional box like this and just building nothing but the corner casings and then everything else if you want a window in there we had the window and you want the wall in there you put the wall in there  [Music]  it's just this simple modifications of the floor plan and then however you would decide to make your room is how you you orchestrate it it's just modules and they just get bolted together  this is the Sarah house which is a container home these are two 40-foot hi cube containers they're 8 foot wide 40 foot long and nine foot six tall when we designed the house we designed the house so that it has a very large front covered porch so that way it puts the eyes and people back into the neighborhood well if you notice on the houses of either side in this genre we have one here that was built in the 20s where you can see the kind of the front porch where it was being utilized now we have a house that it's built in the 1950s where the front porch has kind of gone away and with this style of house we're again trying to reintroduce a front porch as a gathering place for neighbors to visit an idea of keeping an eye on this street and just a nice welcome to your home so as you come in to the house you'll come into a front porch and then you'll enter into the the start of where the shipping containers begin both of these containers we've left the ceiling natural here because we kind of like the character of the design of it but then on top of this we have insulation and then we've got above this ceiling where it approximately r45 and insulation then we have a rubber membrane roof on top of it okay the insulation in the walls were using echo bats which is a insulation made with a binder of sugar corn and then we've also used bio foam as a base so when our walls were right around our 26 and insulation we put in Claire story windows above lots of glass so you don't have a lot of need for turning on lights during the day the window casings I'm just using the old traditional two-by-fours so it has kind of an Amish look to it but it's simple and it's we're trying to make it as inexpensive as possible for the next person once you came in from the house it's a single long wall kitchen no fancy islands everything's very simple easy access I think it's it might be perfect for an older person because it's all on one level you know everything here I'm trying to make it so it non-physically obsolescent for anybody we did not put any ceiling fixtures up either we're using light sconces because we're thinking the person that's gonna be here may be a senior and they're not going to have a bill to be able to change light bulbs so everything's kind of low level and then it's a very open floor plan here in the corner we're figuring this where they'll put their chair and couch and table dining room table can be here and then I put this this is actually wood flooring but I put it on the wall is to give it kind of a more of a dramatic effect then here we're starting I'm going with a small point of demand Rinnai hot water heating system this is one of those systems that it's gas fed but if you turn it on you can walk away the furnace system will be up here and we're going with what is called a mini split which is a small little Mitsubishi system it has a point of I system that will actually track you and point the heat source towards you wherever you are so we're doing away with all of the ducting the seam here that you see going down the center where the containers were actually connected and welded together this will get a box beam out so it has a nice finished detail like the rest of the windows this space is something that we designed it's it's a flex space so if you're if you're a grandparent you have a child that you're keeping an eye on for the day you've got a spot for a daybed you also have a spot for a computer so it's away from the main but it's that central area that kind of the catch-all for your office your desk more people are going towards a computer space than they are the home theaters we went with an oversized bathroom thinking that a caregiver might you know be needed in a situation here so this person's not going to have to move out of this house and move into some place because it's more physically accessible for them the shower is oversized that will be able to hold a person in a walker or somebody that has some physical limitations we have enough space to put in dual sinks but we're not going towards going too with a common sink and then again we've ringed it with glass windows so you have a nice feeling of yet privacy but you have that natural natural daylight and then right here on the other side of this is a a sensible bedroom so we took one wall it's completely all glass so we've got a wonderful view of the mountains in the backyard but people aren't spending time in their bedrooms like they are used to you know in a house this big this bedroom is gonna be used for sleeping pretty much that's it so we're thinking this will be a wonderful size will have sconces on either side of the bed we kept the ceiling again natural we'll have an open closet or an armoire system and then off to a private patio here now behind us you'll see this is a this is a Habitat for Humanity home that's being built that is a 3-bedroom 1-bath home its price range is I think it's 195 this is we've targeted this one for 108 to 112 thousand when we started the process you know we had looked at the preliminary numbers but one of the things here that's so expensive is we know our ground cost you know I spent $40,000 for the lot then the infrastructure underneath and getting the sewer water lines probably an additional $25,000 so you can see where I'm at the house the house is still coming in at fifty five to sixty thousand dollars it cost a little bit more because you had a certain learning factor here you can't go to a book of container of plans and say I want to build this so you're taking something that had been used for the the movement of goods and now all the sudden you're trying to repurpose it for housing so you have certain factors that you want to work with them you know do you think that mass production would take that oh yeah if we can reproduce these and just change them slightly so that you get a different character of it it makes it again a simpler design and a simpler means of reproducing  so we have a shed roof okay just a traditional what okay all of the roofs can fit inside the container can be shipped and everything is unpacked and built and then this is one for gathering rain as you talked about these we had designed up so it's like going to get it like an Ikea it everything is contained everything is inside but they just have to assemble it in much the same way the Sears but everything's gonna be pre-cut pre-fit one of the things with mobile or manufactured housing that we see the neat thing about both of them is the fact that they're built inside an environment where the quality can be controlled when Frank Lloyd Wright he had looked at the style of producing something of what Henry Ford had done with the Model A which was to come up with a small contemporary well built very attractive home in an affordable scale for everybody almost of what the Sears homes were prior to that keeping things very simple I think if shipping containers been around at that point in time I think mr. Lloyd Wright would have been using them in some applications  container costs will run anywhere between 1700 and say $4,000 depending upon if you're close to a coastal city in San Francisco you could buy a container 40-footer for approximately nineteen hundred here in Salt Lake City the containers will run approximately forty one hundred dollars the reason why is because it's just the cost of transport but the big issue here with containers like in this situation the City Planning requires and permanent requires that you have the property on-site so they can inspect it it changes it so if I had done anything left Racal prior to installing the house by done at the factory they wouldn't have been able to do it had to be on the foundation for them to inspect it this is actually the foundation this is a three foot by three foot engineered insulated foundation and then the containers were actually welded to the foundation and it's a full perimeter this house did not require that foundation but because the code says that you have to do a full perimeter foundation in Salt Lake City in this it was mandatory even though this house like containers are designed to be carried on the corner castings which we should have been done here walls did was add two additional expenses and then we put with an oversized carport in the summertime we're thinking this will be used as a patio you know this is a great spot for entertaining and then the wintertime again it becomes a you know covered parking we're still thinking that we have the ability be able to plant a very good garden here that's gonna allow the people to be able to raise their own vegetables but you see we have chickens roosters they're all over goats these are this is a polygamous family and it starts here and it goes all the way down the block and they've been here before pretty much most of the city was founded there's usually a horse in the front yard here we just enacted the bill to be able to have chickens goats these guys of course can have them already because they're originally here as a farm this area was all well known as being a farm area at one time but we still have some of these big old Lots here that we're still trying to bring in even our small little mini farms you know something where people has the ability be able to grow their own vegetables these developers come in the first thing gated communities home theaters you know it doesn't do anything for it I want to get that small house mentality where it's you know it's smaller homes people have less possessions but they have important possessions fifty-five percent of people are living single now and they're not looking at you know this type of house this type of house is there and it's perfect", "uxPdPpi5W4o": "These are the shadow balls that are thrown into this water tank in Los Angeles Contrary to what I had heard its main purpose is not to reduce evaporation So what is it really? Find out that I'm visiting the largest collection of these balls anywhere on Earth in the Los Angeles Reservoir 96 million shadow balls. It is true. 96 million is very rare to see 96 million of anything This is your life jacket that you must wear. OK. Throw your leg and climb in any case you can Here you are. thank you Looking at this I had a lot of questions. Like why are blacks? Is it safe in drinking water? how much do they cost? Does it actually reduce evaporation? What is their real goal? Is it difficult to drive in shadow balls? very Difficult. why is that? These are already partially filled with water and the reason why it is filled with water is because in Los Angeles tank we have some really high winds So if we don't put water in these things, there will be balls that bounce off the five highways people will leave, and they will be everywhere. These keep the balls in the tank, and if they start rolling, they are swaying because the water makes them uneven But this makes it difficult for them to get away from the road, especially when they form structures like crystal Behind the boat, the balls quickly meet up with our soles Some are pulled close to the engine along with the boat Gorgeous Is what you think about the first time they suggested doing this or when it first appeared Yes there was a little. Do you think they were nuts? No, not nuts It's just like. It seems silly It feels like we are in the largest ball pit in the world Yeah right, that's what it looks like you can't say by standing here that we're really flying I think it's likely 40 40 feet here, and 40 feet deep below us You cannot even see any water I thought it was a joke. right? If you do not know. It will be like no, you are not like a green screen or something good, yes it is fake Like when I turn on the faucet at home, does the water come from here? Yes really. Sometimes, or always. most of the time Most of the time the water comes from here, and the nuts are completely So why is the LA tank covered in shadow balls? The problem all started with bromide Bromide is a naturally occurring substance associated with salt water Typically, places like the California Channel descend from the Delta You get some salt water intake and we have some bromide in the water Bromide is harmless and almost impossible to remove And when you disinfect water with ozone, this bromide becomes bromate And bromate is carcinogenic Around the year 2000, they wrote regulations regulating bromate The regulations essentially state if you have an ozone treatment plant Then you have to watch the bromate to be careful not to shape too much So the only place we measured bromine was in our filtration plant The results were always within 10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators So they were confused when they got a call from one of their clients the Los Angeles Beverage Company They said we have some really high levels of bromate showing. Are you aware of this? We said well that we are not showing anything But between the filter station and the client was the tank So they did some tests Almost upon reaching this open tank, bromate levels jumped This bromide has been transformed with chlorine, which is supposed to be safe in bright sunlight, which forms more bromate than ozone. Thus we made this unfortunate scientific discovery that was not actually part of any organizational chart And here we are in the tank We have a water source containing harmful bromide We have chlorine, we must have clean water, we have sunlight because it is open The only option we have is to remove sunlight So we looked at all kinds of things We looked at the floating fabrics across the water We usually put a floating cap on the water but this is a multi-year project And we said we can't manufacture some kind of trampoline with poly like PVC pipes They will just become birds, and you will face a major water quality problem Thus we knew that we have high density polyethylene pipes which are used in the water industry We know they float and we thought at some point, could we float a pile of tubes across the surface Well it's hard to do and very expensive because it contains a lot of material So maybe we could take some tubes and run them through a cutting machine, and we could create a wreck field on the roof Like the back corner of the lake somewhere But anyway all this warm water is soft with plastic floating on top which looks like a petri dish And here is Dr. Brian White doing some research and finding the shadow ball However, they were not called shadow balls at that time This product exists and they are called bird balls They used it in ponds that contain mine remains where they did not want to enter waterfowl and poisoning Also around the airports with docks and they wanted to keep waterfowl so they would not get off and get into jet engines", "sauEsj8YW9M": "hi I'm Ben and this is the house I built out of shipping containers now I've been interested in shipping container architecture for quite some time but I had a really hard time finding good information about how to get building permits or how much would it cost well we did the research we documented everything that we did and now we're so excited to share with you what we learned so check it out this is episode 2 where we'll show you how we move the containers cut them open and started the structural reinforcement after letting the concrete cure for three days we began stripping the molds and getting ready for the day I was most excited about which is crane day this is the single biggest piece of equipment that we rented for this project and it's basically like a giant transformer to pick up the containers they use these fabric straps which are super strong and each one of them has a hook which can hook into the boxes at the corner of the containers we started by moving one the extra 20-foot containers that I bought to store tools and materials on site this is a specialty type of container that opens up not just on the short sides but on the broad side as well next we started moving the other 20-foot container which is going to be the guest bedroom and bathroom this container is lightweight enough that the crane could actually drive while the box was suspended in the air  we had to line up the container so that it wouldn't break one of the drain pipes that was sticking through the concrete  next up was a 40-foot container which is too heavy to drive with so what they did is he just would pick it up swing the arm around to get it closer and then reposition the crane and do the whole thing again we put some blue painters tape on the corners of the concrete foundation just to give us a mark to aim for the second 40-foot container had too far this distance to travel and it's sort of like watching an inchworm sort of move its way across the desert  it took a few attempts and three guys pushing on the corners to get it in the right location now if I was designing this again I would now know that it's possible to get it not exactly where you want it but within about half an inch crane day was a lot of fun but now it's time to turn these steel boxes into a house we started pulling up the floors on the containers now these floors are made out of plywood that is about one in the eighth of an inch thick the steel structure underneath and underside of this plywood is coated with a thick black tar-like substance which is there for waterproofing and they keep the steel from rusting the majority of the plumbing for this house is going to go in this layer right amongst all the steel beams and of course things never line up properly so we're gonna have to cut out a few of them now the pipe that Robert the plumber is working around is going to be the main drain that goes out from the container to the septic tank [Music] originally we had left us a lot longer but once we saw that it wasn't going to align perfectly with the structure inside the container we had to cut it down so it wouldn't break when we drop the container into place this meant that Robert would have to use a jackhammer to expose a little bit of the pipe by removing some of the concrete so we'd have enough room to fit an elbow on it now when I first learned we'd have to do this I was worried it would take a really long time but it actually only took about 45 minutes we then cut holes into other beams so that we could run the smaller drain pipes which will receive the water from the bathroom sink the shower the toilet and the kitchen sink the cut edges of the steel are quite sharp so the plumbers put some twenty minute hot mud and spray foam in between the pipes and the steel beams just to keep the pipes from sliding around and potentially getting damaged now wherever you have drains you also need to have venting pipes and these go all the way up through the walls and out the roof now the black ABS pipe is fine for wastewater going out of the building but for all the clean water coming in we want to use copper this was more time-consuming because the copper has to be sweated with a torch whereas the ABS plastic pipe can just be glued together now in the floor areas that don't have pipes going through them we started filling those places in with rigid insulation we packed in two layers of 2-inch thick rigid insulation and then use spray foam to seal up all the gaps even though this insulation has excellent r-value it's not going to be super effective in this location because the conductivity of the metal is going to create a thermal bridge around it but still we added it in to keep that space full keep critters out of it and to just give us a little bit of extra thermal protection this foam insulation cuts pretty easily with a box cutter so we just cut pieces that would also fit around all the pipes after sealing it all with spray foam and testing to make sure the pipes are watertight we then put the floorboards back on this insulation is just so we can cover up the floors and get to work on the frame we'll show the full insulation details including how we did continuous insulation over this plywood in next week's episode while the rest of the crew was working on the insulation and the floors I began making the structural frames for the doors and windows after double-checking the dimensions of the windows I began making the 45-degree cuts so that I can make a mitered frame the shipping container gets its strength from the continuous corrugated panels so whenever you cut one of these panels you have to reinforce it for these first few windows I decided to use two inch tube steel it works great and is plenty strong but as you see for some of the later frames I switched to angle sections no I did all the welding for the doors and windows using this little Forney welder it's an inexpensive machine that's easy to use great for beginners and powerful enough to build a house with and now for the moment of truth I was ready to cut into the container for the first time now it was pretty nervous about this because you know I paid a reasonable amount of money for these things and we'd spent all this time to get them in the right position so I really didn't want to screw this up I drew out the square that I'm gonna cut out that will allow the frame to fit in using a silver sharpie a level and a piece of cardboard so I could draw straight lines around the corrugation we didn't have electricity from the grid available on the construction site so I set up one of my little goals zero Power Packs with a solar panel and that was enough to keep my batteries for my battery-powered angle grinder nice and charged now I've seen people cut containers open using a plasma cutter but I'm really accurate with the angle grinder it's a much easier tool to use and less expensive I just went slow made sure that was following along the lines I went through quite a few discs but it only took about an hour and a half to cut out this entire window the paint on these containers is really thick so I wire brushed it away to expose the bare steel in preparation for welding I needed a way to hold the frame in place while I welded the frame to the corrugated metal so I built these sliding supports out of two by fours that would allow me to clamp the two by fours to the corrugation and hold the frame nice and flush to the corrugation this is important because when you cut into these big panels of corrugated metal they can bow and flex quite a bit with this technique it's pretty important that the hole you cut into corrugated metal is just the right size because you don't want to be having to bridge across with the welder to connect the pieces you don't have to do continuous seams all the way around I just tried to get about two to three inch welds about every six to eight inches I screwed up an over cut on this piece but I just filled it in with my welder  you  the second one went a lot smoother I took more time in making sure that my initial drawing on the container was perfect and I went a lot slower with the cutting as well making sure to stay right on the line it was about a hundred and twenty degrees inside these steel boxes and cutting open the window was a great experience not only get to see the view but you get this rush of cooler just a hundred and five degree air coming in  you  it's definitely worth it to go really slow and get your initial cut out as accurate as possible the welding for the second one was a lot easier because I wasn't bridging as big of a gap between the frame and the corrugated steel on the first window I ended up making seams that were a little bit too long on the second one I kind of got it right and was sticking to seams that were just about 2 to 3 inches long if he try to weld seams that are too long and continuous the heat buildup from all the welding can start to deform and Bend the corrugated metal  for the two big 10 foot long by folding doors I wanted a frame that was a little bit stronger so I went with 3 inch by 2 inch tube steel  I glued some blocks of wood to the underside of a steel square and then I used that to clamp my tube steel pieces at nice right angles I learned that grinding things once they're installed is a little bit more difficult especially if you have to get up on a ladder so I made sure to grind out all my wells as I welded them  now the frames for the doors don't need a bottom piece but I didn't want to move this without one because it might Bend so I just welded in a temporary support I also didn't cut the vertical pieces to length until I had welded the whole thing together this way I can make sure that both sides were even working close to the ground is great because you can keep everything nice and flat but it did make it so that we'd have to flip the frames over in order to cut all the way through from the other side with the angle grinder  first frame is done time to make a second one exactly the same for these big doors we started cutting out the openings from the inside since it was easier to get up on a ladder with the nice flat floor black sharpie lines showed up real strong against the light beige interiors so it was easier to cut from the inside because I could see the line really crisply even through all the sweat and fog on the safety glasses no matter what side you're in though it's easier to cut the part of the corrugation that's closest to you so I did do some of it outside as well it's also easier to cut real close and flush to the support beam from the outside because from the inside it's hard to get the angle grinder at the right angle because the floor gets in the way now one thing to be careful for is that when you're cutting the container the walls are under some pressure and all of a sudden every once in a while they will jump or move and this can pinch the angle grinder or snap off a blade these big pieces of metal are bendy heavy and have jagged edges so it's a little bit tricky to handle them without cutting yourself up  some containers have welded on steel loops that are used to strap down cargo I just cut these out as well the corrugated metal was welded to this base beam along the container I switched to a heavier angle grinder and just ground this all down I stripped away the paint in preparation for welding and we lifted this 10 foot by 7 foot frame into place remembering the lesson from the windows about bridging the gaps we cut a little bit more on the conservative side and it wasn't quite big enough so we just ground the way until the frame fit in perfectly we started by tacking the frame to the base beam at the bottom corner and then slowly worked our way up making sure everything was still level the three inch wide tube steel was a lot easier to weld to the corrugation than the two inch steel because there was just a lot more surface area to connect the welds to and the radius of the tube steel wasn't sloping away from the corrugation as soon as I got the frame packed in and secured to the container I cut away the temporary support in retrospect I should have welded this about six inches higher than I did just to give myself a little bit more room to cut it off  so while I was welding in the first frame the guys started cutting the opening for the second one now you might think that shipping containers are quite strong and don't need any additional structural support but that's not actually the case if you're doing a fully permitted code approved building our structural engineer had to design an interior support system out of to buy lumber and plywood that would meet all the structural requirements from the permitting office this required substantial headers over these large by folding doors we were figuring this out as we went along and we knew that the doors and windows would be the trickiest parts so we were made sure to frame round those and get that all set relative to the drawings before filling in all the wall spaces around them once you have the key structural elements in place using a nail gun to add in two by fours isn't too hard  on most of the projects that I have been involved with the header is directly over the door itself but in this case the header has to be tied in to the square steel tube that runs along the upper length of the container and so therefore we had to push the header up and then frame out underneath it the purpose of the header is to provide support over large doors or windows you don't want deflection down on to these frames which neither cause them to break or it could make them very difficult to open the frame we was going pretty quickly but nothing was really tied into the container yet except for the 2x4 that runs along the bottom of the wall that was attached to the plywood that is part of the container floor  the stretches of walls that don't have doors in windows or plumbing features went a lot faster because we could panel eyes and build the walls and sections outside we could then drag these into the container and then shoot nails down through this bottom 2x4 or sill plate and into the plywood deck below now I've had a lot of people ask why any sort of additional structure is needed I mean aren't these steel boxes shouldn't they be strong enough by themselves the problem isn't that these boxes aren't strong enough it's where they get their strength and it's from these continuous corrugated panels that strength is compromised when we cut into them even though we are reinforcing where we cut but the more important problem is that this steel is exposed to the outside and it's only about 1/8 of an inch thick if you're relying on exterior steel that's relatively thin for the structural support of the building if someone doesn't maintain the paint and it starts to rust out the whole building could collapse you don't really want buildings that can have structural failures just due to owner neglect the most annoying part of the framing was attaching the walls to the steel containers we nailed these galvanized steel brackets to a 2x4 and then nail this on top of the walls to create a double top plate and then drive self-tapping screws through the holes in the brackets and into the square steel tube that runs along the top of the container now putting this many self-tapping screws into steel is not fun and this took a minute our walls are taller than 8 feet and we're gonna have to add plywood sheathing so we added an additional pieces of 2x4 in between the studs so we'd have a surface for nailing on the plywood  the ceiling will be supported by two by fours on joist hangers we didn't nail into two by fours yet because we still have to add insulation and sprinkler systems and other things but we just cut them and set them in place for now so to recap we have a two by four at the bottom vertical two by fours with stiffeners some additional pieces for attaching the plywood and eventually drywall hangers to support the two by force that will support the ceiling a double top plate with brackets attached to the container  another tricky structural requirement was that we had to tie down some of the shear walls to the foundation we have to have a steel rod coming up from the concrete now we can get in there one of two ways we can either cast it in place and use a coupling nut or we can drill a hole and epoxy it in there but in either case it has to come up through the container through a top plate where this galvanized steel bracket can be bolted to it and then that bracket can be attached to a four by six or four by four post so Tony wrestled with that but we didn't want to lock the post in place until we knew how the window installation would go after cleaning all the welds with wire brush and then sprayed a few coats of rusty metal primer over the welds the exposed steel that I brushed away on the container and the frames themselves we ran a heavy B decock around the inside of the frame and then press the window into place the nailing flange on the window is going right up against the inside of the frame and then we drove self tapping screws through the flange and into the steel frame now this wouldn't be an ideal building detail in anything but a dry climate like this because you really have to rely on the silicone caulk from the exterior between the window unit and the steel frame to be your rain protection with the window in place Tony then felt comfortable adding in the post  so here's how the whole aiming for this end wall looks we have a steel rod going into the foundation that attaches to a bracket that connects to a post which is tied into the rest of the 2x4 framing I recommend drilling holes in using anchoring epoxy to fix two steel rods into the concrete it's way easier than trying to cast them in perfectly now you may have noticed that the part of the floor that the steel rod went through was steel and that's because this is part of the container where forklifts can come in to lift up the container from the end you may notice that our building details are different throughout the project and that's because we were learning as we went the frames I made out a tube steel for the first set of doors and windows work just fine but I noticed that it was very difficult to hold them perfectly in place and it was a really unforgiving detail where you had to cut the window hole perfect so for the next set of doors he used angle steel to make the frames this way I would have a flange that could catch on the hole in the container which would make it easier for clamping getting it straight and it would give us a little bit of a overlapping connection where we could caulk it from both sides I used an angle grinder to notch out the ends of these pieces of angle steel so it did fit together and have a nice flat flange  these frames are going to reinforce the openings for the swinging entry doors [Applause] welded the corners added a temporary support piece and then flip the frame over and welded from the other side the 20-foot container which is going to house the guest bedroom has two swinging doors that are parallel to each other that's going to create opportunities for cross ventilation my buddy Eric was visiting so we had ourselves a dueling angle grinder situation Eric is a really talented metal worker and be sure to check out his work I'll put a link to his Instagram in the description box below I feel like this is a much better way to frame the doors and windows not only does the flange catch nicely on the corrugation it actually gives you a really clean aesthetic from the outside as well you also get two different areas to weld the frame to the corrugated metal on the outside you weld right along the opening but on the inside you're welding the edge of the flange to the surface of the corrugated metal  it's also nice because it gives us to seems to call one on the inside and one on the outside I'll show finish drawings of the different window framing details next week as I show how I finished trimming out all the windows and doors and also in the next episode of the modern home project will show how we did the insulation install the doors and windows and start having a little bit of fun along the way  be sure to check out the first episode and don't forget to subscribe and turn on notifications  you  oh yeah and our new website

of several days I'm going to tell you where we are and what's going on so one evening last week it was almost dark not quite we'd put our son to bed it was a school night and my beautiful bride dearly a.k.a giggly growing myself we're actually going to bed very early it was dusk and someone knocked on our door which is odd because that just never happens we live way out in the middle of nowhere we have gates we have security cameras we keep to ourselves so I got a little nervous at first so I reached over to the nightstand opened the drawer and felt around in there grabbed my what we'll call protection okay I grabbed my crayon so I took my crayon and I made my way to the door I opened the door and there stood this little old man hunched over probably 80 years old and he said are you the one they call crazy Lake and I said well sir I reckon I am he goes we got to talk so I stepped out on the porch he sat down without even being invited to do so and we try to make this short which as you know I'm not very good at he goes on to tell me that he lives in an old cabin on top of the mountain this mountain that is several miles away from our place if you take the road but if you walk up the hill as I've been doing this week and you're going to understand why here in a minute it's about three-quarters of a mile now he lives by himself his wife's been dead more than 20 years he's always in the forest cutting firewood he's got his Gardens he grows most of his own food and he said that he has experienced some strange things and it just occurred to him about a week ago that they're very similar to the things we've been experiencing on our homestead and ironically like I said he's only three quarters of a mile away above us so how he came to know about us um what we had going on was that he said is he these are his words he says he had a family of do-gooders from some church who likes to come out about twice a week and bringing provisions he says he doesn't really understand why because he's got money in his basement piled up to the floor and it's so old it's got mold growing on it you guys know the type but he says he likes some he enjoys talking with him gives him somebody to talk to a couple times a week and he tells their teenage children these stories about some of the experiences he has on his property and they cling to every word and he kind of gets a kick out of it and so he doesn't tell him you know he doesn't need need their provisions he takes him happy to see him every two weeks so he said last week when this family came up to bring him stuff he didn't really need because he can afford to buy it himself one of the kids had their gadget as he called it but it was a cell phone and they said look look this is like the stuff you're talking about and they were showing him the videos now of course he recognized our place because his family's been here on the land for six generations that's how he got all that old moldy money I don't think anybody in his family's had to work since too long after the settlement of Jamestown but he said he didn't tell them too much when he watched those videos but he knew in his head that we were having the exact same experiences down here that he's having on top of his mountain so he said look crazy Lake he says I got trees down to everywhere as you can see here and I'll give you another view he says I got red oak I got he's got some Hickory he's got I got the best firewood burning logs all over my place she said and I'm kind of afraid to go up there and cut him because every time I do I feel like these things he called him wood buggers he says I feel like these buggers are just all over me just staring through me and said he's getting older is gonna be hard work anyway he says look if you come up and you bring your little cardboard cutouts and you bring your camera and and he says if you're willing to work on my place for about a week cut up some of this wood he says you take half leave me half see if you can get anything on camera to confirm my suspicions I'd really appreciate it and you have as much wood as you want as long as you only take half so I said all right that's a deal sounds like a win-win to me and so here we go over the over the course of the next several days and I've been over here cutting for several days already as you can see and yes I've had the hair on the back of my neck stand up a few times so we're gonna see what we can get on camera so pay very close attention get ready to put timestamps what you think you see or hear and what you think it is what time in the video you think it is and let's see if we can confirm for this kind old hermit man with all that moldy money in his basement his suspicions hey guys this is day two of filming working up here at the old Hermits homestead up here on top of the mountain about three-quarters of a mile above my place yesterday I recorded the opening scene the introduction but I didn't have any scenes where I was holding up the blue rectangle or the red circle because frankly there were a couple of times where somebody ever here wants some attention well I felt like the hair on the back of my neck was standing up but but as I looked around to see if he she it or they was peering at us from a tree top or from behind some boulders the older gentleman that owns the place would show up just to chat for a bit so I think it was just I I could sense somebody was watching me it was him so we're gonna see if we can get some more footage today timestamp what you think you might see or hear we see any Pickers coming out behind trees or whatnot okay guys so here's what's going on I've got this camera set up the Overlook while I'm gonna be working I'm gonna be down in that ravine getting the wood that I cut up yesterday throwing it up out of the ravine dragging it on the sled to the clearing so that we can pick it up with the tractor I want you to keep your eyes open back here there's a big giant outcropping back oh hey hey the gentleman owns a place just showed up yeah I'm actually getting trying to get some of this on video do you want to say hi no he says he's shy but then you know those people that watch the video that kind of told you about meek and he says he doesn't want to what what's that sure I'm not gonna turn down the second set of hands oh okay well he says he's gonna help me but he doesn't want to be recorded on any he he called it a contraption if oh and well I have this thing I call it well yeah you saw it in one video yeah okay well he doesn't want to be recorded you know so I'm gonna turn this off I'm gonna take advantage of the second set of hands and then sir he must have gone in for water or gloves or something cuz now he's gone  okay well I'll record until he gets back I'm gonna go over here and throw stuff up out at the gully so you just keep your eyes open see if you see anything if you do timestamp it  [Applause]  watch up here guys something really weirds going on here this is day three of this experiment this little project I've got going on here helping this old man that it was about three-quarters of a mile through the woods up here behind me split wood so I was just getting ready to go up to his place I was gonna drive it's a couple miles on the road but just three-quarters of a mile straight up the hill and I came out and I saw him stand at the edge of my woods so I figure well rewind and listen right there  I figured he wants to walk up so we'll walk up I came over here he stepped into the woods just as I mean I wasn't ten yards away from the woods myself I stepped into the woods and now he's gone  okay I'll record more once I get up there and I get up with him and we start cutting wood you know and I'm gonna we're gonna watch the background see if we hear anything but I gotta find this old guy first and I'm kind of thinking I'm saying or hearing something right up here I don't even have my rectangles and circles with me but I'm detecting  well I guess I'll be driving up  mm hey I'm that guys  I was getting ready to head back to the house get my chainsaw and drive up to his place but something's got me cut something's got me cut off and surrounded something just threw something at me there's something straight back there watch I'm gonna flip the phone and zoom  there's something large and brownish-gray back there guys  back here  my gosh it's looking right at us back here that's not the Hermit what is right there  hey guys this is the morning of day 4 up here at the hermit's homestead helping him as you can see cut up a lot of this this wood we cut up an entire well I cut up an entire huge red oak just yesterday there's a few odd things going on that I want to kind of get on recording here number one I have not seen the Hermit since yesterday morning when I saw him at the edge of my woods followed him into the woods and then he just vanished I came back up here that day which is yesterday in work as you could see most of the day and he never showed up so I came up early this morning it's like 6 o'clock right now in the morning and he's not here so I don't know if he went into town I don't know what's going on I'm starting to get a little bit concerned number 2 this is another weird thing as you know if you follow the channel we have a bunch of hands egg-layers we had two hands we called them our cantankerous hands or as they say here in Virginia trifling they would never stay in the pen they fly out whenever they wanted and we just kind of gave up in which we knew their days were numbered because we have a lot of foxes and hawks is where we live and there's one red fox in particular who was just doesn't seem to be afraid of anything he or she would come down and hang out by the chicken pan and roll around on its back and scratch its back and all this so about two weeks ago on Mother's Day this is late May I think yeah this is May so just a week or two ago was Mother's Day we went into town that took my beautiful bride dearly aka giggly girl and our son we got together went into town went to dinner for Mother's Day and we came back in these two hens were dead we just found piles of feathers we you know just put them did the math it had to been the Fox right so this morning about 5:30 in the morning I'm walking around through my front field where we have you know 400 trees or whatever we planted and right in the middle of this man-made force we've created is this Fox and it's dead now I thought about putting it on video but I just don't think that kind of things appropriate I don't think it would violate any YouTube policies or anything like that but there's just you know just because you have the right to do something doesn't make it the right thing to do so I'm not going to show you the carcass of this beautiful creature and we didn't begrudge it for killing our hands it did what it's designed to do by nature and it has to eat but I have to ask what is it that killed this Fox and why and then now thirdly you see behind me this empty Dorito bag I brought this up here with me yesterday on the mountain when I came up to work in my lunch bucket and I I guess I took him out to eat him I had two sandwiches ham and cheese and mayonnaise and these chips I ate two sandwiches but I didn't eat the chips because I was full I guess I thought I put it back in my lunch bucket or something but obviously I left them well I came up here this morning and I see the empty wrapper two things I want to point out about this and I know what you saw we hear cars you can't be on top of a mountain just over here to my right your left as you're viewing this is a steep drop-off and there's a road way down there and it makes it sound like it's closer than it is but anyway this bag was not ripped open it was open from the top and inside  is this a way of saying thank you  day for I'm hoping the hermit's going to show up but I got to get to work check back in with you later hey guys this is day five in the final day of this project and it has ended a little bit more strange than I could ever have imagined I'm heading back down off the mountain back to my place so I got up to the old Hermits place this morning and I see this big old black pickup truck and a guy and a girl about my age you know late 40s standing there I get up there and the guy says to me hey you the one to cut up all this wood for us I said yeah he said why sure do you appreciate it I said well you're welcome I said I been up here helping the old guy all week and  he said you have and he looked over to the one who turns out as his wife and they kind of chuckled he says he you seen him - did you house well sure I seen him so I haven't seen you in the last few days I said but he came down to the house a couple weeks ago and introduced himself and I left out the whole PVS stuff I didn't want I mean I don't know how much these folks knew but I didn't want get my six well I tell you this story so anyway I said yeah I haven't seen in the last few days told him the last time I saw him was up here a couple days ago down here disappeared into my woods and they laughed and they said alright so what kind of deal is that you made with the old guy and I said well I told him I'd help him cut up this wood he had laying around I'd take half he'd keep half God laughed and he said well he goes you go on and take your half we appreciate you doing the work you've done you can have that that's fair enough I said so are you two the couple from church that come up and keep an eye out on this guy bringing provisions every few weeks guy laughed again he says boy he says let me tell you something that's funny called me boy it's an old southern country thing because we're about the same age he goes we're not we don't go to church he says maybe on Christmas and Easter he says that old man used to live up here it was my great uncle he said we're we're about the last living relatives he had here in this part of the country and we just came up keep an eye on him when he was still living just like we come up every couple weeks keep an eye on the place make sure nobody's hampering around with it now I said still living what are you talking about he smiled he said he's been dead for two years now and I was like you're kidding me right and he laughed he said don't worry you're not the only one that seemed and yeah only ones talked to him the last couple of years he said there's always been strange things going on up here on this land it's been a for centuries we've never been able to explain any of it but we're not surprised to see that it's still going on so he and I work together we moved some of those big rounds we'd cut together and brought him out took him out into his field so I go back and split him and he's up there still splitting today I might go back up for my wood and I might just never go back to that place again so guys it appears as if the old Hermits homestead was haunted but when I found out just from whom or by whom my blood ran cold see you next time for more there at the PBS s the potential Bigfoot Sasquatch show care home staying off the grid", "Doyqp5Ue6XY": "okay so I just started the rinsing process and we have already found another piece of surface gold I never get sick of seeing this another piece of surface gold just staring at me right in the face  there is no Wi-Fi out here but I promise you you will find a better connection good morning or good afternoon everybody welcome to the channel if you are new to it my name is Pauly your host here today we are exploring my brand new claim now I notice there's a lot of bedrock on this claim so I think the best thing to do for our first day is to really just do some crevice thing now my first day I just main first day bringing you guys along I was here just the other day working on this crevice here but I could not remove this but now I actually have a tool that will actually move this big piece of bedrock so first thing we're gonna do is just finish this crevice that I got started the other day and then when we're done this and we're satisfied with it we're gonna move on and see what else we can find  okay so I got this little chunk out now for the rest all right just removed all the overburden bedrock in the center of this crevice now it's just a matter of scooping it all out see what kind of gold we get and that will determine whether we stick to this line or we move on so right as I turn off the camera I noticed our first piece of exposed candy that's a good sign that there's gold around now I obviously know that there's gold here I mean this is why I'm coming back to the spot but it's just best to clean out a spot when you start working it so here we are let's continue I just coming up that piece I saw or not  first little pan microdots that you probably can't see on to the next  all right second pan and we're looking much better we have one little chunky piece that you could probably see and a whole bunch of little micros however there are too little wiry looking pieces in there which I do like so let's stay on this trend and hopefully continue to find more candy we are slowly making progress I still have a little bit more to move right here and once that's done I'll get this all wet hopefully find more exposed cracks that I can actually break open and get to the real bottom of the bedrock and then hopefully we'll be able to use my little sucker tool over there and suck out everything yes yes look at all that breaking bedrock gold will hide in Breaking Bad Rock looking good so I just did another pan and of course I wasn't filming it but check this out Oh Oh what do we have here yes look at that we have a nice piece of gold I would consider that a picker and a bunch of little bits of gold and we're not even at the very bottom yet so next thing to do is obviously just finish cleaning out all this dirtiness and then now we're gonna fill it full of water suck it out and then we'll see what we get  so there is a lot more material than I thought there would be so what I'm going to do is pan this down till there's only a little bit of material left and then I'm going to go back get more dirt and then add to that pan and just so keep repeating that process until we have one pan left and then hopefully we will do one reveal of maybe a lot of gold who knows  next pan oh geez  ok so it's been about 15 minutes and as you can see there's still more material to pan out and I've done about five pans and I couldn't resist it I did a little peek and check that out two pieces of visible gold so we know we're doing the right thing now it's just a matter of continuing this process I think I have one maybe two more pans left then I'll soak it rinse it suck it out and then we'll do hopefully an even better reveal  okay so I just started the rinsing process and we've already found another piece of surface gold I never get sick of seeing this another piece of surface gold just staring at me right in the face again it you when you see this you just never get sick of it that is really cool okay let's pick it up with some tweezers because it's a lot more fun to do it this way my other camera set up okay oh nice hopefully my other camera is focusing on this hoop that is a nice little flat piece of gold and a stick with it sweet so before I forget I'm gonna put that piece of gold and the snuffle and I'm just going to quickly rinse a little more just to see if we're not missing anything else  I love doing that I don't see anything all right we'll get to scraping and then second now before I continue this crevice I just wanted to quickly take this opportunity to announce something some of you out there have been asking me if there's a way to further support pioneer Pauley and there wasn't for the longest time I just don't like to accept anything to be honest but now there is I set up a temporary line of Pioneer poly merchandise which includes the logo that I usually wear it but I didn't didn't wear it today and then some other random stuff that you may find funny so now you can further support the channel and plus you can get something out of it for you or even a friend okay because I'm impatient I'm just going to pan this out right now which is about seven or eight pans of concentrated material and then we'll use a sucker tool to finish it all  Plus dick  all right almost really  hey I can see ya okay can I turn you around okay okay okay let's see yeah it's hard to do this with one hand we do have gold showing up I'm so bad at this yay okay I got to do a better job one sec all right just getting rid of a little bit more material to make this one hand pan man guy do a better job oh my gosh there we go so all over the place but there you have it some candy that's not tea bag seven or eight pans cool now let's suck out the rest here's a better shot for you guys I thought I'd try a little bit harder we have a little piece of wire in there to show that sweet okay time to sucker out  so I cleaned out this crevice the best I could with my sucker tube now I can't really get the very very very very very bottom of this crevice because the sucker tube just doesn't allow it doesn't go deep enough so I used my it's not for bottle to kind of suck up the areas that I missed filled up the bucket a little bit better and now it's time to cross her fingers and see what we get  there's not a lot of material in there but hopefully will be a lot of gold  and your nuggets trapped in this crossfire no no one  all right we're getting close  a little closer no gold yet hope some tiny bits okay alright that is awesome okay I'm gonna grab the grab the camera so this is kind of awkward because I'm kind of hold a pan over my mic so doesn't get wet but there is clearly gold there that is really cool I love seeing these little bits that you can kind of pick up well I can pick that one up that's cool so I'm noticing all the fine gold is disappearing the deeper I go which is a good sign because that means you're going to the bigger gold I was trying to be educational but the deeper you go the more closer you are to the bedrock the better gold you will find so with that kind of color it's gonna be really hard just to leave this so for more reassurance I dumped out my snuffer bottle and yeah with that kind of color I'm not just gonna walk away from this I'm now obligated to dig as deep as I can because who knows you you could find a nugget just crammed in the very bottom I am noticing a little bit more cracks in here too so I'm just gonna stick to this and hopefully find more all right so here we go again I broke up more bedrock that's all the material that I was able to remove sucked up a bit more and yeah we're gonna go pan this but my buddy Jimbo over there just found his first picker so I just congratulated him on social media wonderful alright let's pan this out I'm gonna be very quick with this I hate that I'm gonna be very quick with this because it's starting to rain again and I just want to put my camera away  why bedrock lot of sharp bloodthirsty bedrock well there's a little bit of gold but a couple specs in there okay I'll do a better clean up for you guys okay so not as good as I thought it would be but that's where the flower gold was okay so we're calling it a day today we've been here for about eight hours now and it's starting to rain pretty hard so let's hurry up go home check out the gold and do a little dance  so that wasn't a bad day at all I was honestly hoping to find a big nugget in there but you can't get them every time but maybe coming up when we scuba dive that waterfall from my last video we will find the mother lode anyways this is a loot that we found today yes no complaints here I left the city got in touch with nature and returned with some jewelry now here's a photo of Jimbo's take for the day he is quite happy and I'm happy he left me with an unfinished crevasse to work next time so let's just weigh the gold and talk about how much time I wasted I'd like to start off by weighing that one biggest piece that I have in there point one eight grams all right that's not too bad now for the rest of this stuff  come on five ounces point 72 grams so less than 50 bucks anyways that is it for this video if you enjoyed it please let me know by leaving a like just like comment or even subscribing social media is open to it for those of

until the next one ah we'll see you later", "NI71-qySsrE": "in our society we're encouraged to aspire to ownership of a large home but what happens when you own that large home with a tennis court and swimming pool and realized that it's not making you happy today we've traveled to the Hawke's Bay to meet a wonderful and inspiring young family who traded in society's dream for one of their own [Music]  hello good to meet you mate yeah a nice visit hi elder oh yeah nice to meet you welcome this container looks great so tell me a little bit about how you actually came to be living and a couple of shipping containers we bought this big fight bedroom house and we were living in and working constantly to and maintain it and we just thought this isn't right yeah we've bought our first house and it was a two-bedroom well one and a half bedroom like little deceased estate in all condon we've renovated that and then we found out we're having another baby and so we decided we needed more space and so we bought a three-bedroom house and we were innovated there and sold it and we moved to Hawke's Bay and the next step was sort of like obviously a bigger house cuz we were going to have another baby and so we ended up with a five bedrooms three bathrooms like formal lounge it was a tennis court in the pool and we sort of thought that the epitome of what you're supposed to do I guess and then after living and working that house for about a year and we realized how much work goes into mowing all those lawns and uh it was just it was took up all of our time effort it was busy and was it was hard work but it was just more the fact that we had like three little children that just wanted to spend time with us and we didn't have time because we had to get these jobs done like that's when I was on YouTube and I saw your channel and like got inspired I guess and yeah it hit it lucky I was like set him down one night we watched a few and he was like let's go and so with a bit of grey paper roughly weeding right designed the home put the house on the market and yeah we were going ho then people thought were nuts but we're really happy it was a bit more than we've ever made yeah well I love to know that I'm partly responsible for this variation because it's really incredible now this is actually two 40-foot shipping containers that have been slightly offset from one another correct yep so they're too high cube 40-footers this one in particular we've cut the roof right out and pitched it up we've obviously used steel framing and then inset with our container cutouts to fill in the blanks and that is made a good high pitched roof and that issue works well because we have our solar panels on the top there cuz off-grid system you know it's wicks a tree and you've mentioned that these containers are off the grid can we talk about that sure can we use a weed basically we have a six kilowatt solar system we've got 18 panels on the roof and then we've got our 8 260 m power batteries here for our storage battery storage as you can see they're low maintenance they're nice and duty we have to go in there this is quite nice so that is actually a huge solar system we've got power tube in yeah that's great we've more power than we need really and if we were connecting back into the grid fit that would be cool but with the way that we chose to live was just to have enough to live and then the company that put the system and for us we were the first and so they were determined to prove that it could be done and it could be done really easily and it has it's been great for us what about water collection here we hit a water boy connection right here so we've plumbed into it so we're basically yeah basically offered so we did the shipping containers come from are they new containers or did they have a life before so these are wind and watertight sticking here in containers so we've purchased these obviously they've got a bit of a history behind them and we've just repurposed them there's a lot of panel reading yes we're pretty lucky that they came in pretty good condition we've had before when doing water tight and they were only just waters height whereas these ones have been really they were really quite good quality when we caught them and the dents we feel just add to character totally I absolutely agree yeah well the containers look amazing from the outside and then really came to get a tiller and see what you've done on the inside Kylene oh so this is the duty into the house and for a tiny house or small house we thought that this was a bit of a luxury but it has intervened it's so practical the linen cupboard and everything fits and enter here and just a bit of extra pantry storage and then washing machine and a little deep freeze which means that like all the dirt comes in comes in here everything just gets washed and popped away without like mucking up the rest of the house and the buddha in the power and everything comes through here so a real practical space for us such a good idea including a space like this because you're right otherwise if you're going straight into the house you don't get that break from the weather you've got nowhere to put sort of muddy and wet yeah yeah and three kids this is really a mudroom but yeah weights well for us Tony does so this is our front door come on oh this is lovely you can definitely feel the additional space that you get from actually having those two containers stacked side-by-side oh sure keen it makes a huge difference a it means that you can have a proper lounge and a full sized kitchen in one space which when you hit them just the width of a single container didn't really feel like good for either so tell me about the design of the container and how you've laid everything out okay so you just walked right into our galley kitchen so as you can see this is our kitchen which is got ample storage you'll notice when you walk throughout the house we've used a lot of copper which we we seem to love in where she feel makes it feel warm so we love it absolutely BETT sink is so beautiful is that an old hot water cylinder yeah yeah was originally it was a hot water cylinder and then we scored it as a big old plant pot I'll just count it down fleet it and put a plug in it and he's our kitchen sink and a tremendous amount of bench space to work on here oh yeah totally having a big kitchen was really important to us cuz I love to cook but we've got a young family in May I'm sharing meals and you know it was kind of one of the biggest design things for us when we were laying out how big the kitchen was gonna be it was it's a luxury I guess but we had to have it and then the way that the whole kitchen sort of slides up against this wall you've created a large open space for your living room yeah it's worked really well as you can see we got a nice good size a comfortable lounge we didn't face the TV we can turn around and face the fire and winter you know a good couch makes Sur makes a difference to good good flow good radius on the corner tells a feeling listen yes good score so how easy was it actually to join the two containers together and how does that work for all of your electrical wiring and plumbing and all of that sort of stuff yeah piece of cake really am because I'm an engineer so it's my kind of trade so it's just a case of having a whole bridging it with some good structural steel in this is this is bolted with it with a bit of a gasket silicon sealant through the flange faces and then we've got a seal over the top and it's made it completely watertight and it's piece of cake really a lot of people are quite worried about thermal bridging when you're dealing with steel structures how does it work for sort of moisture and insulation and everything in this space we do spray from insulation for inside the walls yeah yeah because steel doesn't breathe you have to have a you have to sort out their thermal break so you can't have a cavity in the air where condensation can condensate so you have to use this non porous insulation so it's the only proper way to do it and then you've got the kids room through their AC yeah kids room three kids one room very impressive yeah initially we score all these doors from an old Albert hotel which is an old hotel here in town obviously struck them and split them in half because we couldn't have one big intrusive door and we didn't like the looks of Kennedy slaughters there was too new for us so we wanted use the recycled thing so hints these nice little doors so how did you lay the space out to work for three kids well we've got one girl when two boys so it turned out that the mezzanine in the middle with a door at the top with a curtain that closes gives her enough privacy and she's really happy and content up there and then we made the boys beds just slightly narrower than a normal single bed so that they had a bit of room to sort of tuck their toys underneath and their shoes and want that kind of stuff which means it's least cost our own it's it really does work the kids love it we're a bit worried about having three kids and won't be June but it turns out that they like hanging out together so yeah it works a treat actually yes it works and then what do we have over here so this is a bathroom what can I never look very nice here you can really see the height of the ceiling coming into its own can you Oh totally it actually really works it makes a small space seem big yeah so we've got the air we've got the Japanese soaked up there so we can able all three kids in the bath at the same time if we really wanted to which we quite often do I love how you've continued the theme of all of the copper fittings everywhere because it just brings a lot of warmth and kind of rustic character into space definitely well that particular sink is what actually started us on the out copper you found a nice I don't trade me you know we thought that this would be a good kitchen sink it tuned up and what oh it's a quite small I was a twenty five bucks but it was like the beginning of a very expensive um fitting for the house because I think everything had to be copper because I love so much I wanted to use it and then you've got a composting toilet here as well yes composting loo so not quite a bucket with sawdust one has got a ventilation system and it was what we could find on the market through nearly four years ago now it's been so great it's really a lot easier to use than we thought it was going to be a lot less smelly than we thought it was gonna be and yeah we wouldn't go back should we explore the other side of the house yeah we've got a drying rack above the fireplace and for sake of winter good to dry you your clothes inside and I have only law just freeing up the floor space it makes such a big difference in the house is so warm when you're the fire going that in two hours washings drying job done excellent yeah and then over here is our dining room this was supposed to be the master bedroom but sharing meal at the end of the day us all together was huge for us right yeah and that's why we've been up with a smaller room for us and a bigger dining and both which has like loads of storage it's just leaping bags and blankets and games and a bookshelf and yeah and then we get the staircase which makes for a great wardrobe so will your clothes are stored in here yeah well all the hanging sort of clothes we've got to see the drawers upstairs but yes and tell me about the design of your sleeping loft well there wasn't a lot of design in it because I said we have to have like to put to make it workable and then we went from there but also the clearance from the top from the outside to transport it around had to be like we will only be able to go so high yes so that resists our touch yeah basically there the overall height has set for legal height on a low loader transporter and that's what's it L touching the roof yeah it feels like up the years at like a it feels like a safe closed in space which works well for sleeping and then down here and there's plenty of light and air coming through and yeah it was a good compromise and then you've got this lovely kind of open area to your outdoor space as well yeah we felt it was quite important when you're living a bit smaller to him indoor/outdoor flight because you live quite differently say big bifold doors they're opening by Forbes on the other side and it just creates lovely space so how long have you been living in this home now nearly three years yeah he's right in like three years yeah I was quickly ahead hey is this gone really it's gone really fast as they actually the longest think we'd love to Nene house since we've been married yeah yeah we've been married over T Newseum it's very easy to lemon definitely it's a very easy live low-maintenance simple love it you've moved into this home from a much larger home yeah what was your downsizing process like it wasn't too hard I went to work and also did it we had five we had five bedrooms to downsize into sort of technically one and a half so we trade Mead and gave away and just got rid of so so much stuff and on a whole downsizing was very freeing living in this house has completely changed our lives right oh so here we did it as a test to see how much space we would need and we understood that we it would have to change and evolve as our children got older but what we've realized is that we don't need that massive McMansion anymore like we're really happy to live with less and we and yeah our quality of life is just so much better because of it definitely so what about the cost of building this home this costs us about 150,000 that's all materials and parts that obviously there doesn't include a lot of our labor and things like that so yeah it was nine months of hard slog building it because everything was done like we just we hadn't been inside another container house until we were pretty much finished and I hadn't actually been inside a container and all the ones that these ones arrived at MIT's yard and I opened up the door and I was so hot in here and it's absolutely tiny what have we done but still like made it work yeah totally well there's no doubt about it you have managed to turn these two 40-foot containers into an incredible home for your family thank you so much for sharing over thank you keys for coming thank you for coming yeah looking at a shipping container it really is quite utilitarian it's a cold hard metal box and quite far removed from something that you'd consider homey this couple though have taken a couple of those boxes and truly turned them into something beautiful using salvaged materials and Timbers all to create a wonderful family home [Music] you  [Music]", "iTNJLEV8CG8": "hello everybody welcome back to the shop thanks for choosing to spend a little time with me in the shop today if you haven't already done so please go down below and click Subscribe also don't forget to click the bell right next to the word subscribe that way I can send you a message every time I put up a new video now today's video is going to be on filters what I've decided to do is to cut open a bunch of filters and show you what's inside  one of those things as a mechanic that just drives me crazy is the marketing wank that comes around any automotive product our product is better it makes your car last longer your engine go for a million miles where's the proof the proof is in the puddin this is going to be our puddin for today  [Music]  [Music] so one of the things I wanted to do before we actually cut these filters open is I wanted to show you some of the parts of the filter and explain actually how the filter works so first off the filter screws on and there is a gasket if you do this yourself you know this gasket needs to be lubricated before you put it on otherwise you have a pretty tough time getting it back off secondly there's some threads in here these threads are specific to the vehicle now how does this actually work well this can holds the oil pressure for the vehicle so oil goes through the filter in a pretty specific direction oil goes through all of the holes on the outside as it goes through all the holes on the outside it pushes past this little rubber valve right here this valves called an anti drain back valve so when the oil is pushing in it pushes this out of the way okay comes into the filter itself flows around the outside of the filter in its force through the filter media into the center channel where it comes back out through the center of the filter  [Music]  so first of all they can the wick scan is by far the heaviest gauge can it actually has a legitimate spring that holds the filter in there the filter is a very high quality so it feels like a very heavy material folks this is where it gets pretty unbelievable for me remember the one that was - the pretty orange color that looked like it was such a great filter let me show you what you get inside the baseplate is a fairly high quality the gaskets standard the anti drain back valve look at that can you see the cardboard that's stuck on that that's unbelievable to me but look here look at the quality this filter is already rusted on the inside these are brand new filters I just ordered these a week ago you can see that it's already rusting on the inside of the filter now where's that rust gonna go it's gonna go inside your engine before I cut this apart I just got to tell you this has got to be beyond about the most cheeseball thing I've seen so far look at the filter coming apart already absolute garbage by far by far the napa gold filter is the highest quality which not surprisingly is second only to the wicks filter when you look at the filters as a whole the napa gold filter and the wicks filter far surpasses anybody else the Purolator filter is what I would call standard quality the can is nothing remarkable the filter on the inside is actually pretty good it's fairly well made it doesn't break apart easy the spring is a typical bent metal type spring the base plate is a heavy base and the anti drain back vowels is a is an acceptable quality next is the Fram this folks is why I made this video see this Fram filter can you see that Fram filter you see that Fram filter this filter is cardboard there's no metal in it and notice when I took it apart the cardboard is already coming apart in it it's already rusted inside the filter inside there is the drain back valve doesn't even do anything but push inside the cardboard the base is of good quality I'll give them that standard type spring but holy cow the filter is already starting to separate from the cardboard just by a little twisting action so can you imagine what happens to it when oil pressure starts pushing through it garbage the Bosch filter the filter itself is what I would call an acceptable quality it's rugged its rigid typical crapola spring the basis of high quality it's a very thick heavy material and the anti drain back valve is of a good quality too  let's cut them apart see what we got [Music]  real quick synopsis let's do a side-by-side comparison on the filters and and how they all line up the Napa gold filter is a very high quality you can see it has a joiner reinforcing bar here that joins the pleats reinforces everything you notice that it's very solid the inner workings of the filter itself it's put in here with some kind of elastomeric compound to to glue the filter in place next one up is the Purolator pretty good quality it's not as rigid as the Napa gold filter is but it's what I would call an acceptable quality not too keen on the springing thing that's in here baseplate on this particular filter is very heavy-duty drain back valve as a Parker part number on it partner is a maker of a lot of seals and hydraulic hoses and rubber next up is the Fram filter what can I say I mean when you pull a filter open just like the filter for the small-block Chevrolet we pulled apart was rusted inside this one's rusted inside as well folks that's complete garbage that's unacceptable to even to even think about buying something that has that low of quality control when I even tried to cut the filter apart look what happened the cardboard is just it's I can't I just I'm almost speechless next up is the wicks filter which was absolutely identical to the Napa gold we kind of already theorized that again high-quality same setup here you can see I wrenched on this one a little bit kind of pulled it apart but very high quality it's got a joiner borrower it joins the two pleats together so there's no leakage where the pleats meet up it's a good sturdy piece of material both of these have the proper spring and I'm a real spring the base plate is very heavy and it's got to be 10 gauge material that this is made out of both anti drain back valves are very heavy-duty then we'll move to the Bosch filter so the Bosch filter I can say pretty much with 100% conviction is the same filter as the pure later with a different brand name on it again same as pure later it's a good quality filter not nearly as heavy duty as the wicks or the napa gold they by far are the most high quality but let's just not look at quality look at let's look at the fill our media itself but you can't compare this filter media that's this long to this filter media here where my fingers are is where the filter media for the pure later ends and this there's that much more filter media where the filter media for the wicks napa gold filter goes that more filter media means the more surface area that can trap particulates in your engine so without a doubt I can tell you that I will never buy one of these filters ever if I was on a deserted island and the only auto parts store that was open had one of these filters there might be the only time I would consider using this filter because otherwise not a filter for my choice never will be one in my shop especially not when two filters in a row both have rust inside the filter and not just a little surface rust actually flaking rust that you can actually wipe off onto your fingers when you can see that in your fingers like that that's going into your oil into your engine I hope this has brought a little insight to what is actually inside these filters and the marketing wank behind what they try to get you to think as a high quality filter thanks for spending some time with me here in the shop don't forget to subscribe to the do write fabrication YouTube channel and we'll see you real soon thanks for watching I hope

trillion of these cans are manufactured\u2014that\u2019s about 15,000 per second \u2014 so many that we overlook the can\u2019s superb engineering. Let\u2019s start with why the can is shaped like it is. Why a cylinder? An engineer might like to make a spherical can: it has the smallest surface area for a given volume and so it uses the least amount of material. And it also has no corners and so no weak points because the pressure in the can uniformly stresses the walls. But a sphere is not practical to manufacture. And, of course, it\u2019ll roll off the table. Also, when packed as closely as possible only 74% of the total volume is taken up by the product. The other 26% is void space, which goes unused when transporting the cans or in a store display. An engineer could solve this problem by making a cuboid-shaped can. It sits on a table, but it\u2019s uncomfortable to hold and awkward to drink from. And while easier to manufacture than a sphere, these edges are weak points and require very thick walls. But the cuboid surpasses the sphere in packing efficiently: it has almost no wasted space, although at the sacrifice of using more surface area to contain the same volume as the sphere. So, to create a can engineers use a cylinder, which has elements of both shapes. From the top, it\u2019s like a sphere, and from the side, it\u2019s like a cuboid .A cylinder has a maximum packing factor of about 91% -- not as good as the cuboid, but better than the sphere. Most important of all: the cylinder can be rapidly manufactured. The can begins as this disk \u2014called a \u201cblank\u201d\u2014 punched from an aluminum sheet about three-tenths of a mm thick. The first step starts with a \u201cdrawing die,\u201d on which sits the blank and then a \u201cblank holder\u201d that rests on top. We\u2019ll look at a slice of the die so we can see what\u2019s happening. A cylindrical punch presses down on the die, forming the blank into a cup. This process is called \u201cdrawing.\u201d This cup is about 88 mm in diameter\u2014larger than the final can \u2014 so it\u2019s re-drawn. That process starts with this wide cup, and uses another cylindrical punch, and a \u201credrawing die.\u201d The punch presses the cup through the redrawing die and transforms it into a cup with a narrower diameter, which is a bit taller. This redrawn cup is now the final diameter of the can\u201465 mm\u2014but it\u2019s not yet tall enough. A punch pushes this redrawn cup through an ironing ring. The cup stays the same diameter, as it becomes taller and the walls thinner. If we watch this process again up close, you see the initial thick wall, and then the thinner wall after it\u2019s ironed. Ironing occurs in three stages, each progressively making the walls thinner and the can taller. After the cup is ironed, the dome on the bottom is formed. This requires a convex doming tool and a punch with a matching concave indentation. As the punch presses the cup downward onto the doming tool: the cup bottom then deforms into a dome. That dome reduces the amount of metal needed to manufacture the can. The dome bottom  uses less material than if the bottom were flat. A dome is an arch, revolved around its center. The curvature of the arch distributes some of the vertical load into horizontal forces, allowing a dome to withstand greater pressure than a flat beam. On the dome you might notice two large numbers. These debossed numbers are engraved on the doming tool. The first number signifies the production line in the factory, and the second number signifies the bodymaker number -- the bodymaker is the machine that performs the redrawing, ironing and doming processes. These numbers help troubleshoot production problems in the factory. In that factory the manufacturing of a can takes place at a tremendous rate: these last three steps\u2014 re-drawing, ironing and doming\u2014all happen in one continuous stroke and in only a seventh of a second. The punch moves at a maximum velocity of 11 meters per second and experiences a maximum acceleration of 45 Gs. This process runs continuously for 6 months or around 100 million cycles before the machine needs servicing. Now, if you look closely at the top of the can body, you see that the edges are wavy and uneven. These irregularities occur during the forming. To get a nice even edge, about 6 mm is trimmed off of the top. With an even top the can can now be sealed. But before that sealing occurs a colorful design is printed on the outside\u2014the term of art in the industry is \u201cdecoration.\u201d The inside also gets a treatment: a spray-coated epoxy lacquer separates the can\u2019s contents from its aluminum walls. This prevents the drink from acquiring a metallic taste, and also keeps acids in the beverage from dissolving the aluminium. The next step forms the can\u2019s neck \u2014 the part of the can body that tapers inward. This \u201cnecking\u201d requires eleven-stages. The forming starts with a straight-walled can. The top is brought slightly inward. And then this is repeated further up the can wall until the final diameter is reached. The change in neck size at each stage is so subtle that you can barely tell a difference between one stage and the next. Each one of these stages works by inserting an inner die into the can body, then pushing an outer die\u2014called the necking sleeve\u2014around the outside. The necking sleeve retracts, the inner die retracts, and the can moves to the next stage. The necking is drawn out over many different stages to prevent wrinkling, or pleating, of the thin aluminum. Since the 1960\u2019s, the diameter of the can end has become smaller by 6 mm \u2014 from 60 mm to 54 mm today. This seems a tiny amount, but the aluminum can industry produces over 100 billion cans a year, so that 6 mm reduction saves at least 90 million kilograms of aluminum annually. That amount would form a solid cube of aluminum 32 meters on a side\u2014compare that to a 787 dreamliner with a 60 meter wingspan. Now, after the neck has been formed the top is flanged; that is, it flares out slightly and allows the end to be secured to the body, which brings us to the next brilliant design feature: the double seam. On older steel cans manufactures welded or soldered on the ends. This often contaminated the can\u2019s contents. In contrast, today\u2019s cans use a hygienic \u201cdouble seam,\u201d which can also be made faster. This can is cut in half so you can see the cross-section of the double seam. To create this seam, a machine uses two basic operations. The first curls the end of the can cover around the flange of the can body. The second operation presses the folds of metal together to form an air-tight seal. While the operations themselves are simple, they require high precision. Parts misaligned by a small fraction of a millimeter cause the seam to fail. In addition to the clamping of the end and can body, a sealing compound ensures that no gas escapes through the double seam. The compound is applied as a liquid, then hardens to a form a gasket. The end, attached immediately after the cans is filled, traps gases inside the can to create pressures of about 30 psi or 2 times atmospheric pressure. In soda, carbon dioxide produces the pressure; in non-carbonated drinks, like juices, nitrogen is added. So why is a beverage can pressurized? Because the internal pressure creates a strong can despite its thin walls. Squeeze a closed, pressurized can\u2014it barely gives. Then squeeze an empty can\u2014it flexes easily. The cans walls are thin\u2014only 75 microns thick\u2014and they are flimsy, but the internal pressure of a sealed can pushes outwards equally, and so keeps the wall in tension. This tension is key: the thin wall acts like a chain \u2014 in compression it has no strength, but in tension it\u2019s very strong. The internal pressure strengthens the cans so that they can be safely stacked \u2014a pressurized can easily supports the weight of an average human adult. It also adds enough strength so that the can doesn\u2019t need the corrugations like in this unpressurized steel food can. While initially pressurized to about 2 atmospheres, a can may experience up to 4 atmospheres of internal pressure in its lifetime due to elevated temperatures; and so the can is designed to withstand up to 6 atmospheres or 90 psi before the dome or the end will buckle. Why is there a tab on the end of the can? It seems a silly question\u2014how else would you open it? But originally cans didn\u2019t have tabs. Very early steel cans were called flat tops, for pretty obvious reasons. You use a special opener to puncture a hole to drink from, and a hole to vent. In the 1960\u2019s, the pull-tab was invented so that no opener was needed. The tab worked like this: you lift up this ring to vent the can, and pull the tab to create the opening. Easy enough, but now you\u2019ve got this loose tab. The cans ask you to \u201cPlease don\u2019t litter\u201d but sadly, these pull tabs got tossed on the ground, where the sharp edges of the tabs cut the barefeet of beachgoers\u2014or they harmed wildlife. So, the beverage can industry responded by inventing the modern stay-on tab. This little tab involved clever engineering. The tab starts as a second class lever; this is like a wheelbarrow because tip of the tap is the fulcrum and the rivet the load \u2014 the effort is being applied on the end. But here\u2019s the genius part: the moment the can vents the tab switches to a first class lever which is like a seesaw: where the load is now at the tip and the fulcrum is the rivet. You can see clearly how the tab, when working as a wheelbarrow, lifts the rivet. In fact, part of the reason this clever design works is because the pressure inside the can helps to force the rivet up, which in turn depresses the outer edge of the top until it vents the can and then the tab changes to a seesaw lever. Looking from the inside of the can, you can see how the tab first opens near the rivet. If you tried to simply force the scored metal section into the can using the tab as a first class lever with the rivet as the fulcrum throughout you'd be fighting the pressure inside the can: the tab would be enormous, and expensive. If you\u2019d like to learn more about the entire lifecycle of the aluminum can, watch this animated video by Rexam that describes can manufacturing and recycling. A typical aluminum can today contains about 70% recycled material. Also, Discovery\u2019s How It\u2019s Made has some great footage of the manufacturing machinery. Here are two different stepwise animations of the entire can forming process. And lastly, these are two detailed animations of the cup drawing and redrawing processes. The aluminum beverage can is so ubiquitous that it\u2019s easy to take for granted. But the next time you take a sip from one, consider the decades of ingenious design required to create this modern engineering marvel. I\u2019m Bill Hammack, the engineer guy.

The Drina River House You\u2019ve always wanted a house surrounded by a moat, right? Everyone has!! But how about taking it a step further and building your home in the middle of a river? Well, that\u2019s what a group of boys decided to do in 1968 when they were looking for the ideal spot to sunbathe. The rock they chose wasn\u2019t so comfortable so over time they added floorboards, then walls, and then a roof- with all materials transported to the site by boat. The house has, unsurprisingly, been victim to flooding of the Drina river, which nearly destroyed it several times. Every time it was built again from the ground up. Despite its remote location on the eastern edge of the Tara national park in Serbia, it\u2019s still fairly close to the local town of Bajina Basta, so there\u2019s not too far to go to get supplies. Even so, this solitary house seems as if it were just surrounded by nothing but nature for miles around. 9. Casa Do Penedo The Casa Do Penedo, which means the house of stone, is in the Fafe mountains of northern Portugal. The 16.5-foot-tall house, built at 2,600 feet above sea level, is often referred to as the \u2018Flintstones House\u2019, and it\u2019s clear to see why. The house has actually been constructed between 4 large granite boulders, and took two years to complete after work began in 1972. While it doesn\u2019t have any electricity, to keep with the Flintstones theme, it does have a large fireplace, and even a swimming pool that\u2019s carved into one of the bigger rocks. For those concerned about safety, not that I think you were worried, but you\u2019ll be glad to hear that the doors and windows are all completely bulletproof- something that would have keep the owners feeling secure when they spent their holidays there. Not sure why they thought that was necessary!! You\u2019ll have to go there to find out! Now, the house has been turned into a museum, and is open to any visitors willing to make the morning\u2019s walk up the side of a mountain to see it. 8. The Crystal Mill The Crystal Mill is one of the most famous, and isolated, homes in Colorado. It was built on a rocky outcrop in the Crystal river, and is surrounded by the most amazing views! It\u2019s about 6 miles away from Marble, and is close to the former town of Crystal. It\u2019s so remote, that it\u2019s only accessible during summer and fall months by a 1 lane track, and only accessible by foot across treacherous terrain at other times of the year. It\u2019s best to only really go there if the weather is good. The mill was originally constructed in 1893, and the flowing water would be used to power its air compressor which, in turn, powered drills in the nearby mines. It was known as the Sheep Mountain Power House, and was crucial for the miners to be able to drill the holes into the rock. Then they would fill them with dynamite and blow everything up to release the ore. The mill\u2019s functional role ended in 1917, and has since been used as a home and a popular visitors attraction. Which do you prefer, the Flintsones or the Mine?? 7. Katskhi Pillar How far would you go for your beliefs? Religious devotion can lead people to make big sacrifices for their faith, but one monk has taken the idea of isolation to a whole new level. Maxime Qavtaradze has spent the past 20 years living in a cottage on the Katskhi Pillar- a 131-foot-tall rock that stands above his monastery in Georgia. He lives his life in almost complete solitude high above his Georgian monastery. It\u2019s such an isolated place that the only means of accessing the home is by a 131 foot ladder, something that takes 20 minutes in each direction. Maxime does it twice a week to pray with his followers. Maxime became a monk after doing time in prison and he wanted to make a change. There is now a small religious community down below and his followers also winch supplies and other things to him whenever he needs them. He very rarely allows visitors to climb the pillar- those that do are required to spend a number of days praying at the base before being deemed pure enough to make the ascent. Originally it took him years to complete construction of his cottage, and to start with he was forced to sleep in an old fridge until he had hoisted a bed frame up there. It might seem like an extreme place to live, but the practise of living on top of the Katskhi pillar has its roots in the 15th century when Christian monks would live in such places to avoid worldly temptation. That way, it was easier to feel closer to God and feel his presence. 6. Wordie House If you like the cold, and staying indoors for most of the year, then maybe this is the place for you. Wordie House is one of the most remote buildings on the planet- located on Winter Island in Antarctica. It was a former outpost, known as Base F, that was set up by the British during the second world war to protect their interests from Argentina! After that, it became a base for scientific operations in the following years. Its role was primarily as a meteorological research station, but in 1954, it was replaced by another outpost on a nearby island, leaving Base F as a relic of a far gone age. Today it\u2019s known as Wordie House, in honour of James Wordie, the chief scientist on Shackleton\u2019s trans Antarctic mission between 1914 and 1917. It\u2019s maintained by the British Antarctic Heritage Trust, and remains virtually identical to how it was when it was in use. It has a kitchen and a bunk room to hold up to 5 people, with a wooden stove for warmth. The bookcases along the walls are full of books and board games, a telling sign that there wasn\u2019t much to do here over the winter months when it would snow for days on end. You can actually go visit and stay at the house today, and it offers a unique opportunity to see how people used to live. The kitchen still has cans of coffee and potatoes, the old radio equipment is still the pride of place, and the instructions for the rudimentary fire prevention methods are still pinned up on the wall by the entrance. If you need an escape from the world, this is it!!! 5. Long Studio The Long Studio, on Fogo Island in Newfoundland, Canada, was built to give artists a secluded space to work. The modern structure has been built on a series of stilts to raise it above the ground- which makes it feel as if it\u2019s hovering over the landscape. It\u2019s made from traditional materials from the region, such as the rough-sawn pine used on the exterior, and whitewashed spruce inside, and is split into 3 parts- the entrance porch, a courtyard, and a studio or living space. It was inspired by the local fishermen\u2019s houses. It\u2019s a completely self sustaining building, with power provided from solar panels, and its own waste treatment facilities. Designed by Norwegian architects, Saunders Architecture, the Long Studio is actually a proof of concept design that they are planning to replicate in other sites across Canada as well. It\u2019s a special way to breathe new life onto the island. It kind of reminds me of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway? Do you think so? 4. The Solvay Hut Located on the north eastern ridge of the Matterhorn mountain in Switzerland, the Solvay Hut is the highest mountain hut owned by the Swiss Alpine Club, at 13,133 feet above sea level. The club has a number of huts in the mountains which provide shelter and food to anyone who needs it, but the Solvay hut is by far the most remote, and is intended for use in emergencies only. It was originally built in 1915, when the materials were carried most of the distance by animals, and then a temporary cable car was constructed solely to help with moving the larger pieces on the final stretch. It was fully rebuilt in 1966, but was only fitted with an emergency telephone as late as 1976. This hut really is on top of the world, and is only 1,500 feet from the summit of the Matterhorn. Its precarious position on a ledge offers spectacular views across the mountain range, and is a favourite spot for climbers to take a well earned break before completing their trip. 3. Ellidaey Island If you really want an isolated home, and an entire island to go with it- then how about Ellidaey island in Iceland? It\u2019s a part of the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago to the south of the country, and there\u2019s quite a mystery to the place. It\u2019s believed that people have lived there for more than 300 years, mainly because of the abundant puffin population that they hunted and sold to the mainland, as well as raising cattle on the pastures. In such an isolated place, though, it became impractical to keep living like this, so by the 1930\u2019s, the island had been completely abandoned. They went on to find, however, that there was nowhere quite like this to find puffins, so a lodge was built on the island so they would have somewhere to stay when they returned on a trip. Since then, there have been intermittent residents in the one structure that remains there. You are surrounded by natural wildlife and complete solitude! There\u2019s also a rumour that the government of Iceland has actually given the island to the singer Bjork as thanks for increasing Iceland\u2019s notoriety around the world. While these rumours remain unsubstantiated, there\u2019s still a chance that if you were to spend time here, you\u2019d be wondering to yourself why \u201cit\u2019s oh, so quiet\u2026\u201d 2. San Colombano Hermitage First built in 1319, the San Colombano hermitage was named after the Irish Saint Colomban who, according to legend, took up residence in the cave after vanquishing the dragon that originally lived there. A small church was then built at the entrance to one of the small caves to provide accommodation for pilgrims and monks. As you can see, it\u2019s quite high up on the rock face, and is accessible by 102 steps that have been cut into the rock and lead to a path across the gorge of the river Leno beneath. The Hermitage was in constant use until 1782, and then was looked after by the local people who lived in the valley. More recently, in 1996, the local authorities conducted extensive restoration work to bring back the original beauty of the place- including frescoes that depict Saint Colomban battling the dragon, an image of paradise, and the main altar which features a 15th century Madonna surrounded by saints. 1. Just Room Enough Island Just room enough island is, as the name would suggest, a small piece of land that is just room enough for a house, and barely anything else! It\u2019s one of the almost 2,000 islands of the Thousand Islands chain on the New York side of the St Lawrence River, and is the location of one of the most famous isolated homes in the region. The island was bought by the Sizeland family in the 1950\u2019s who were looking for a private holiday retreat. They built their house with the walls as far to the edge of the land as possible, and placed a benchon the front next to the tree, and that\u2019s all the space they had. The house has its own generator and because it\u2019s not connected to the mainland, it is still used today as a retreat. I don\u2019t know about you but being THAT close to the water makes me nervous!! While the original intent was for the family to have peace and isolation, the peculiar home soon attracted the attention of sightseers and tourists who wanted to see it for themselves, and made the river a lot busier than it had been before. It feels more like a houseboat than a house on an island, (so much for the peaceful moat idea) and many have questioned whether it even counts as an island in the first place. It could just be considered a house on a rock!! Different areas have different classifications for what constitutes an island, and here an island is defined as a piece of land that is larger than 1 square foot, is permanently above water level, and sustains at least one tree. By those metrics, Just Room Enough Island is definitely an island, but if the owners decide to build a floating garage extension, it\u2019ll surely be up for debate! Thanks for watching!!", "lnewtgCovFs": "[Music] in the summer of 2016 my parents sold the family cabin to finance a move to Victoria BC something they had been dreaming of since retiring an anticipation of losing our recreational retreat the purchased a piece of hay woods and wetlands to the southeast of the lake the previous year my dream was to build a suitable winter dwelling nestled in the trees where the forest meets the field before the ice and snow gripped our land to keep us warm through the long cold season it's ahead it was late July now and my vacation days would be heating up through August with plans to drive my own family west camping along the way to join my folks in warming their new home on the coast throughout her vacation west I was busy researching designing and estimating costs for our tiny abode money for the lack thereof would be a major factor in making compromises and design choices there were other considerations as well the cabin had to be under a hundred square feet in order to avoid not only costly building and development permits but also to ensure our property taxes would not change from agricultural to residential or recreational a substantial shift in money for sure it needed to sleep my family of four and be heated using the free resources of our woods weekdays being filled with work and home life meant the cabin if it were to happen at all would have to be built on weekends and mostly on my own [Music] days before we headed west a friend and I snuck away to the property and having paid a local contractor some beer to level a small pad of land down to the heavy clay base we constructed an insulated a foundation and floor for the tiny cabin in under half a day thus providing us to start to our tiny abode there was no turning back now [Music] it was September now and having salvaged scavenged and scrounge truckloads of building materials I was anxious to start framing and on the second weekend of the month I was lucky to get a second set of hands to start the process my cousin Mike and I made our way north with gas for the generator borrowed saws and kilos of nails  we framed and cheated the cabin walls installed the loft joists and floorboards and by the end of one day's work even the ridgepole and rafters were locked and blocked in place on day two we installed the door jamb door ruff fit two main windows for the cabin before wrapping our work in a bale tarp as the storm Jurina from the west [Music] it was two weeks before I was able to get back up to the property and this time I only had one day to get the roof on and finished the windows fortunately Mike was willing to jump in again and my good friend Dave came up for the day as well [Music] after capping the rafters and gable face with fascia Mike took to the roof and began installing the strapping we'd need to install the steel sheeting Dave took on the three small windows in the front of the cabin and then turned his attention to beginning the trim on the exterior [Music] although metal sheeting goes up pretty quick and covers a large area the trim pieces that make the roof watertight can take a good long while and by the end of the day we were feeling the fatigue but the roof was on now and I was grateful for the efforts of friends and family [Music] a week passed and once again I had a single day of time to come up to the property and get something accomplished my goal was to close the cabin up tight on the exterior which meant closing in soffits sealing and insulating windows and door jamb complete the trim between the exterior sheathing and making sure that the elements were no longer going to be an issue on the prairies you never know when the weather is going to turn and as it turned out I was lucky to get things all sealed up when I did  [Music] five days can make a big difference in Saskatchewan the next weekend I struggled to get the truck onto the property through 50 centimetres of fresh snow a week into October and I was very happy to have a warm and dry work space inside our tiny cabin shell with mr. heater blasting I laid in the insulation vapor barrier wired lights for an eventual 12-volt solar system and boarded things up where I could I was very pleased with the progress by the end of day two at this point I had seven not full days of work into the cabin and it was really taking shape [Music] another two weeks passed before any work happened at the cabin again but I was extra enthusiastic about the work this weekend as I was finally installing the wood stove a custom-built a wall-mounted heat shield from the roofing top sheet and had fabricated a wood stove stand to mount the front of that everything measured up and installed flawlessly  [Music] assumed had a fire roaring inside the cabin was keeping warm under its own power I was ecstatic  the flawless install on Saturday meant that I had time to complete the last of the wall boards an interior trim into the evening which started to make the cabin feel like a real home Sunday I only had a few hours before I needed to be back in the city but took the early morning hours to focus on framing interior walls for the pantry and water closet the 29th of October marked a milestone my boys accompanied me up to the land this weekend and gave their resounding approval for their new clubhouse complete with her very own sleeping loft the boys fashioned a crude ladder out of scrap wood and hundreds of nails and I nailed up a temporary banister in the law they insisted we sleep in the cabin that night and I honestly couldn't think of a reason why not we pulled the cushions from the camper trailer lit the stove and christened the tiny cabin with a good night's sleep  I got a few hours on Sunday with the boys exploring the woods to add some finishing touches and put some polish on some rough edges I snapped some pictures designed to entice my wife to join us on the next outing and we headed back home [Music] despite a successful pilot run it was a few weeks before we got back to the cabin in the meantime I had crafted a few finishing touches to be installed upon our next excursion which my wife was happy to join us for upon arrival we were able to install the bench pullout bed downstairs a proper fitting ladder and railing for the loft a sliding barn door for the water closet  and the start of a kitchen counter and cupboards [Music] with these final touches the cabin was officially functional for a long winter ahead we had achieved a budget cabin build which measured 96 square feet slept my family of four and the wood stove not only provided warmth but as luck would have it served as a fine s'more machine as well the cabin is now in its third year protecting us against the elements and provides us with everything we need to enjoy the property and escape from the pressures and nonsense of city life  to be honest we rarely think of the old family cabin anymore and when we do we all agree we wouldn't trade our acres of wild or tiny conveniences for anything  you [Music]  you", "T7mYB6x68DY": "what is happening everybody my name is Michael and I'm gonna show you the quickest and easiest way to make a concrete countertop let's make something cool  [Music] no doubt by now you've watched at least 100 concrete countertop how-to videos and not one of them is the same but they all seem to have at least really frustrating things in common a lot of work they also you're a player three to seven they pure time for the tops and they make the project look like one big huge pain in the ass I'm gonna make you two promises after you're done watching this video I promise you that this is going to be the quickest and easiest method of making a concrete countertop that you have ever seen and I promise that you'll never have to watch another concrete countertop video ever again so this is where it all begins this is just a simple mold made out of a simple box but this is where we can make the concrete do whatever we want it to do and you can make this any shape and size that you want you can make this a square shape a rectangle L shape or a half a heart shape I'm not saying that I've done that before but this is America and I can do it a lot but I'll make a separate video on all the different mold making techniques but for now we're gonna stick with this two foot by four foot rectangle and you're gonna see how this is gonna make a statement all on its own and I'll show you some cool stuff along the way in making concrete countertops there seems to be about three basic methods the first method cast-in-place cast-in-place is probably the most traditional way of making a concrete countertop and involves making a form directly over the cabinets pouring in place and then traveling the top smooth the great part about this is that you're pouring right where you're going to be installing it so the installation is already done on the other hand you're gonna have a big fat mess on your hands and you have to rely heavily on your troweling skills the second method is GF RC glass fiber reinforced concrete it's light it's strong it looks great but this requires special order materials and tools and it's just not practical for the everyday DIY er the third method is inverted caste this is a way that you and I are going to do this this is probably the easiest and fastest way to make a concrete countertop it's quick and easy there's minimal mess and there's no troweling skills involved because the mould does all the work for us and yes you'll have to install a big heavy slab of concrete but you have about over 500 friends on Facebook I'm sure that two or three of them are gonna help you install this bad boy so what makes my method it's so much quicker and so much easier than all the other methods out there it's mainly to do with the material I used so let's go pick up our concrete for our top you know what that means depo run let's make like a transformer and roll out  this is the start of the show right here we're gonna use rapid set mortar mix rapid set is expensive they can do so you can't get it anywhere else this guy will go for my half inch thick to six inches thick it is rock solid in one hour one hour later it's 25 psi 20 days later it's 6500 psi so I'm not even going to bother putting any metal reinforcement rabbits uh cement is a CSA basinet so it is three times stronger than any portland-based cement for our project we're hanging two bags oh and before I forget also while you're here you got two baggies of flow control don't forget you're gonna want one bag of flow control per bag of mortar mix if you get all right don't worry I'll explain later [Music]  to construct our mold we're gonna be using a material called melamine mal amine is a particle board with a smooth plastic finish our countertop is an inch and a half thick so I'm going to rip the sides at two and a quarter to accommodate the thickness of the 3/4 inch male amina since the construction of this mold is very simple I'm not going to spend too much time going over the assembly but I do want to share some tips all right so you guys can use whatever kind of screws you want or whatever method you want to get this box together but what I highly recommend are these facts multi-purpose construction screws specifically the waiver heads these guys have got a nice flat head bottom arm so that way you're not gonna have to do any kind of pre drilling and you're not gonna split the wood as you screw these guys together it's gonna make like way simpler you're gonna get this box together way quicker  [Music]  we have a box assembled the only thing left to do now is to seal the corners with a cock we're going to use 100% silicone to seal the corners of the mold after running a bead of caulk we're gonna spray a foam window cleaner on top to prevent the silicone from sticking to any surfaces we don't want it to when we run our finger down the bead to make it smooth this will make cleanup a breeze that's it guys we're gonna let the silicone set up for about 24 hours and then we're gonna pour this bad boy I don't know about you but I'm fucking excited about this make sure the mold is flat and level before you pour all right so we're gonna prep our mold and we're gonna do that by spraying it down with wd-40 so you're gonna make a great release agent so that way our concrete countertops going to pull away from my form with no fuss or muss [Music]  you just want to get a really good coating on this but we don't want any staining puddles and that's pretty much it we're ready to pour at this point but I want to take it one step further I'm going to add a design by simply cutting a stencil out of a sheet of paper I'm then gonna sprinkle dry sanded tile grout over the stencil using a foam cup [Music] I'm going to continue to sprinkle the tile grout on the mold to mimic veins for a natural stone look [Music] it's a good idea to stage your workstation next to your mold it'll save you time and a lot of energy make sure to use cold clean potable water all right this is where I want to stop and make sure that everything I need I've got my concrete got my bucket scraper I've got my flow control got a trowel on standby got my drill on hand clean water and make sure that you have a bucket with water for cleaning your tools in once we get this past this point and we start pouring our concrete it's go time guys we're gonna start by adding five quarts of water to our mixing bucket [Music] then go ahead and dump an entire bag of mortar max into the mixing bucket I strongly suggest mixing one bag at a time especially if you're doing this alone then switch your drill to a low-speed and mix  [Music] I cannot stress to you the importance of doing the Captain Morgan stance we're going to start off with a peanut butter consistency but for our projects we want a more pourable consistency to accomplish this we're gonna add one packet of rapidset flow control flow control is a plasticizer that will give us an instant pancake batter consistency without losing any string or set time  [Music]  mystics dollars I've ever spent pocket scraper  all right at this point we want to take a nice straight board and just run it across the top business the technical term for this is a screen but it's just a board  all right at this point we're just gonna let it sit once this guy starts to kick and we're gonna know because it's gonna start to get light spots then we're gonna want to keep it wet keep it saturated we're gonna start water turning for one hour and after that we can go ahead and flip this bad boy over and we're done we need to work the bubbles up so that we don't have any voids in our concrete we're going to accomplish this by tapping the sides with a hammer or vibrating the sides with a sander and you only have to do this for a few minutes [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  what do you guys think took us about like what 30 minutes to make the mold about five minutes to mix and pour one hour later we were able to flip this guy over and now it's ready for service you guys remember how I didn't put any kind of reinforcement check this out I [Music]  could tell you how much weights on here right now but that is none of your business now sure we've got some pitting going on here from the grout but we want that we're going for a natural stone look in the cool part about a project like this any mistake you make just adds to the character Bob Ross said it best there are no mistakes just a few little accidents thanks Bob Ross [Music] so at this point there you have it it's all done right now we could seal it with a clear coat this is where we would put some sort of topical stain if we wanted to you could also aligned it smooth if you want to but you're gonna find that using this method you're really not going to need to because we have this nice silky smooth finish on the top we have nice rounded corners and you're not sharp you know what I want to take it just one more step further we're gonna give this guy a live edge simply using a mason hammer [Music]  all I'm doing is going about an eighth of an inch or so away from the edge I'm taking the pointy edge of the hammer and I'm just giving it a light tap and then a little harder if needs be and then just do that all the way around flip the countertop over and do the other side go slow at first go easy but for God's sakes please use your safety glasses and your patience [Music]  instant live it for a nice cool industrial look spice it up a little bit [Music] so we could easily install this on a cabinet in a kitchen or a bathroom but I want to do something just a little bit different with this guy my cousin has got this wonky coffee table and I want to make him a really cool coffee table let's replace that shit what are we gonna make this coffee table out of I'm glad you asked what you guys don't have a big mountain of pallets just hanging out behind your shed let's do something with that [Music]  all right we are gonna glue this top on with rabid sets flexible construction adhesive this stuff sticks to just about anything  you  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] guys thank you so much for watching my video truth be told this is my very first video

button and I would love to take you on some more adventures with me and see where this thing goes let's make some cool stuff and I'll see you in the next video [Music]  you", "qhd91cv-b90": "so if you're one of these people that actually enjoy cold weather because you do winter activities and sports and stuff like that then chances are when you're out in it you're already prepared but what if you're one of these people that's trying to avoid winter and you're out trying to actually get somewhere warm and the storm happens well this is what happened to me in my case I already was somewhere warm after spending the winter in the American Southwest and Mexico like all snowbirds I waited for a window in the weather to migrate back north just as the Sun went down a cool wind started to blow a little rain was in the forecast but nothing that really concerned me so in the morning I set out under partly cloudy skies it was actually good driving weather but as soon as I left Wyoming a little rain started to fall it was just a sprinkle at first but eventually it started to pour roughly halfway through my journey the rain let up but the clouds were looking rather ominous heading west an hour later I hit snow this kind of as bad as it gets kind of my worst nightmare coming back to Canada is there to have to be a bloody blizzard snowstorm and super cold why didn't I stay down there the farther I drove the worse it got with frequent patches of black ice so it was time to make a decision do I keep going and hope some weather was better ahead or find shelter and a safe place to ride out the storm as night was approaching the answer was a no-brainer I'm stuck in a snowstorm in Shelby Montana fortunately I made it to a truck stop but it looks like I'm spending the night here whether I want to or not I'm gonna try to get the trailer up. So the questions gonna be can I actually get the roof up. My concern was the freezing rain and ice had glued it shut. yes not exactly the perfect scenario but I got it up that's gonna have to do until the snow stops well not exactly the ending I'd hoped for stranded in a snowstorm and it's just weird I mean this morning it was warm it was like at night it was like 55 degrees during the day it was like 65 75 you know Wyoming and a few hours later I'm in this ah boy glad I like winter just not right now but out the window another drama was taking place a transport truck was spinning on the ice and couldn't get his chains on so I got my traction aids out see if I could lend a hand after a couple of adjustments I got him out and he was on his way again now I just had to find my traction aids in the snow I actually got to use these I hope to pay great get hope that's so cool now I know at least they work so if I have to use them sometime I can on my little trailer and truck oh it's cold damn well I wasn't really planning on using the foam this trip but I'm glad I brought it not only will that keep a little bit more of the heat in but it'll keep some of the moisture out as well the melting snow and the ice that's on the roof every little bit helps well it looks like I'm not the only one stranded there's a few trucks hauling could be horses I'm not quite sure but they're stuck too so the parking lot is full right now it's just about dark it is cold in here it's just above freezing inside it's below freezing outside and it'll be below freezing inside as well if I don't hook up the furnace and I probably won't because I'm gonna use the electric blanket it's what I bought it for it saves heating up the whole trailer when all I have to do is heat up me so here we go I'm stranded snowstorm but I think I'm gonna be nice and warm tonight what I've got is my electric blanket I've got my heavy-duty warm sleeping bag and I'm actually going to wear my sweater tonight because it will be way below freezing I do have a full tank of propane or almost a full tank but I don't plan on using it because then I'm gonna have issues with condensation and I really don't want to be bothered with that so right now I'm just I've got the electric blanket plugged in it's keeping me warm sleeping bags keeping me warm and what I will do though first thing in the morning when it's at its coldest is I'll turn on the furnace just to warm my pants up that way I have warm clothes to get into in the morning and off I go that's it but it's really really important to always have a back-up plan for emergencies like if if I don't have a battery I have propane if I don't have propane or battery I got warm sleeping bag I've got you know like a winter coat you know hat stuff like that so I'm always prepared for the cold prepared for rain prepared for wind I don't know not earthquakes earthquakes I'm I'm hooched I'm I could survive an earthquake but everything else I think I've got reasonable preparation for at least I hope by morning it was very cold and a few more inches of snow had fallen overnight despite this I did keep warm using the electric blanket so I didn't need to turn on the furnace however in the morning I did turned it on in hopes it would help melt the ice on the roof when trying to warm up the car and the trailer at the same time and hopefully I can get out but there's a big truck in my way so story and over yet I don't get it off the top of the roof that's what's going to be going inside make sure you wipe down the sides - so any moisture on them won't leak into the trailer once you close it down the question is are the roads good enough to drive I see some trucks on them and can I get out of this parking lot there's about maybe eight inches of snow okay here it goes trailers out oh boy it's icy if I get stuck man, it's very icy this is just the on-ramp oh my god I don't like it seriously who is I kidding that I could beat Old Man Winter this year no way he got me back this time the border was only 40 miles away but the roads weren't safe so you've got to know when when safety has to trump your goals this morning it's started off okay I'm only about 20 miles to the border now but it's starting to snow again so but I've got a little bit of a convoy of cars and trucks at enemy so I'm hoping I can at least make it to the border life on the road it's not always what you want it to be it just is what it is ironically on the Canadian side the roads were free of ice and snow and I just had to deal with a little fog the trailer however was a mess and it took several passes at the car wash to remove the crusted ice and snow but I made it back safely and that's what counts always go where the road takes you unless the roads not safe so then always go where there's somewhere safe", "UyTrkAqnkFI": "[Music]  [Music]  so this is my father's 1969 280 SL he purchased the car is the second owner actually purchased the car while my mother was in the hospital just after she gave birth to me and he drove this car every day for 10 years back and forth into the Bronx right now the car has over a hundred thousand miles but it has been sitting since 1982 for he originally purchased a 62 Impala convertible I had always wanted a convertible purchase the car took it to his office near the Bronx was stolen in a day eventually purchased another car wasn't very happy with bought this car in January of 1972 and drove it every single day back and forth to the Bronx for ten years it has been sitting like this since probably mid 1982 so it's been 37 years the first step was to clear out the old bushes and weed so we'd have clean access to pull the car out when the garage was eventually emptied based on a very quick inspection I noticed there was a ton of mouse droppings everywhere so I wanted to wear full safety gear which I think is appropriate after the years of dust and whatever else I'm sure to find as we emptied the garage out which was built in 1942 as we were clearing up the space I felt like I was going back into a time capsule from the 1960s there was bottles of rubbing alcohol on the Shelf from 67 alkyd based paint commonly referred to as oil-based enamel paint from the 70s a bottle of diazinon used as a pesticide until it was cancelled from residential use in 2004 and iran s'en butane aerosol can torch sitting next to a gallon of torch fuel so it was a miracle that the Mercedes is still in one piece now since the tires dry rodded years ago we jacked up the rear in placed wheel dollies also known as wheel skates under each tire now in hindsight I should have brought my hydraulic go jacks these are perfect for tight spaces flat tires or really low cars like on the f1 detail the front was even tighter and we couldn't get the jack there because of all the extra in the garage and the car was parked too close to the front wall so the jack wouldn't fit there either so we lifted each side one at a time at first glance though while looking for the lift points the undercarriage is in decent condition all things considering with the flat tires off the ground and on the dollies and after a quick sweeping to make sure that that momentum wasn't killed by a tiny little pebble we pulled and pushed the wheels over the garage floor hump and into the sunlight for the first time in 37 years which was pretty cool  next I opened the door and let in the first fresh air in a very long time and I will say that the interior smelled absolutely awful a mixture of mold sort of musty ish kind of smell and decaying animals it was really gross clearly much of the interior will need to be replaced but for now the goal is to clean it up enough to surprise his father when he gets home later this evening and to prepare the car for the Mercedes text in the following week as you can see the door handle was really moldy the steering wheel and the dash buttons were completely roached out but to see David's expression of the memories as a kid in the backseat and him telling us stories off-camera made this a very special detail for me  when we opened the hood I was expecting a bit more corrosion but it actually looked pretty good although I did find the source of the horrific odor more on this later opening the trunk for the first time in many years I found the original highway flares in the box Mercedes literature and maps and manuals with gorgeous engine diagrams and pop outs for repair as well as other directions or guides in German from 1969  now with all the treasure hunting done it's time to remove the mold to do this we're using lather in the aerator a scrub pad and the interior brush that was cut down to an inch for detailing like this it can be helpful to have two different length brushes to do this take my normal size interior brush and simply cut it down with scissors making it stiffer and more aggressive when appropriate when working on moldy cars always throw away your towels when you're done there's no sense in washing or reusing them so it's best to use cheap tarry towels for round two we used a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water and increased its cleaning ability by using a steam machine all without introducing a stronger ratio of acidity  [Music]  [Music]  while Dan was working on the moldy leather I was vacuuming out the heavy dust dry flaky plastic pieces that had disintegrated years ago spider webs mouse poop and egg corns and of course I remove the mats and carpet where possible to make shampooing easier from there we scrubbed a vacuum steamed and then shampooed everything to kill or at least reduce the smell at this point in the detail we had each blown through three pairs of blue gloves so I went to the store and bought venom steal rip resistant gloves before we win any further with the job [Music]  with the mats in the Sun we moved to the steering wheel notice the color of the steam drips off the bottom of the steering wheel are very gross we also used a long or normal bristle linked brush here after cleaning up the dash a bit Dan switched back to the short hairbrush for the gearbox covered along with lather and the steam machine with the direct spray tip while Dan was working on the front I focused on the rear leather and seat belts now my goal was to kill and remove the mold but obviously I don't recommend using seat belts in this condition and age clearly all this is being replaced upon restoration but I don't want mechanic that gets sick in the process much the same idea as the Eagle Talon restoration the car was stuck in the woods for many years and was getting shipped out of the country but we needed to clean it enough so that I would not get rejected by customs but not so much that it didn't make financial sense for the owner because it would soon be ripped apart in the restoration project as well so it's the same kind of idea here with the interior in better shape we left the ozone machine in for a bit and focused on the exterior step one is kind of my favorite remove all the nests and hope nothing is still living in them as you can see we had a few tenants but their time had passed next up we used compressed air before potentially spraying water now we do this because cleaning this much debris with water only makes it a soaking wet blob of leaves and grass once the layers upon layers of poop and dust were blown off the paint we soak the car in frothy hose --less lubricant to make sure all the seals were functioning properly before power washing it this also gave the dry and brittle paint a bit of dwell time to lift as much of the baked in grime before we hit it with water while the paint was soaking we installed a swivel head nozzle to the power washer to clean the subframe from the spiders and all the dust over the many years of pulling out cars from woods and Barnes mechanics always thank us for power-washing the subframe so they don't have to reach their hands into a nest and get bitten by a spider when the car is on the lift which I would have never thought of so I always make sure to give it a good blast after our frothy test and knowing that the seals are tight we thoroughly power wash the years of dirt off the paint next step was the wheels trim and engine bonnet before quickly agitating with a wet microfiber towel and soap and a degreaser then power washed it once again  okay now at this point in the process we've cleaned the inside we've taken most of the mold off and we moved removed a lot of the mouse droppings and of course the nests and whatnot now a lot of you're gonna be asking hey what about the top here now the owner specifically asked if we could keep that top on for a couple of reasons but one being they're gonna flat bet it and take it to a restoration shop and it's gonna be an open flatbed so they don't want to take it off with fear that we're not gonna be able put it back on so that kind of makes sense so no problem we can work around that the second thing is I know a lot of you are gonna be asking hey how come you take the seats out he specifically said hey can you do me a favor leave the seats in why because his dad is gonna come home he doesn't know that we're doing this and his son David of course is doing that for his dad and he wants him to sit in the car and kind of feel the way that he felt back then etc there's more important thing sometimes than just detailing he wants his dad to kind of remember this this whole experience so at this point we've I'm using air quotes here we've washed it we really didn't wash it wash it we kind of just agitated it to get a lot of the mold and stuff off specifically so that when we polish I'm not using the microfiber pad to soak up a lot of the junk I wanted to use a microfiber pad to sort of abrade the surface and lift off all the old dead skin but not necessarily the mold and in the dirt I hope that makes sense so it's not like a traditional wash we were just kind of pounding away here just to loosen up anything in case when the Machine comes by it jiggles it out and now I have a dirty pad and now I'm scratching the paint you know etc etc so sometimes yeah I used a little judgment with respect to washing so this wasn't this was by no means the greatest wash but in terms of this car it was exactly what it needed so we're gonna dry it off take a little bit of a breath because it's super hot we're wearing these you know crazy things cuz it is really on it I can't describe the smell it's very very moldy and it doesn't like it you know like oh my god he smells so bad it just hits you in the back of the throat it makes you cough so that's that's the ones I get a little bit nervous about so we're wearing protective gear and they're gonna polish this thing out and then go back inside and of course hit it again you know we still got a lot more work doing the inside but it's it's as clean as it's ever been to restore the dry oxidized paint I first tried the Meigs microfiber pad with 210 instead of 105 or 110 as you know managing residue is going to be the main concern here and naturally it was after you buffed the paint if you can't remove the polish or wipe it clean revealing the paint underneath you as the detailer must stop and reassess what you're doing the amount of dead paint being removed is overwhelming the pad and the liquid or in other words there's more dead paint than there is polish the dead paint encapsulate the polish and it sticks to the paint so it's time to change a variable and a technique so instead I used a red foam pad 210 polish and the modown technique and it worked as expected for a step-by-step guide and specifics on how and why to perform the modown technique click the video link above on a new Ford GT to see graphics that help explain the technical aspects if you're interested now the name of the game with old oxidized paint is to develop a feel when your pad is so full of dead paint that it's time to blow it out and start all over again  the Motown process is similar in theory to a massive snowstorm that dropped two feet of snow on your driveway you don't shovel the full two feet at once you boil your back out you take off thin layers at a time so you don't overwhelm the snowblower and have it bogged down this concept is equivalent to the polish sticking or in this case bogging down to the paint to avoid the common issue take smaller fewer and shallower bites to avoid bogging down and sticking to the paint for extra pop on single stage paint we polished with a yellow loop as pad and 2/10 notice I put my suit back on here because it was getting late in the day and the mosquitoes were eating me alive [Music]  afterwards we quickly worked on the trim using a power drill polishing wheel and flits metal polish I also worked a few tight spots of the trim by hand with 2/10 and a microfiber towel well guys the car is basically done now the big thing is David's father is actually showing up coming home from work from New York City and we want to do the reveal now we have a few things left to do I have to finish up a bunch of the chrome but you can see the areas over here have really been done well we're gonna do some chrome here just finish that up I'll do the other side play with the windows of course vacuum do a few more things but more importantly David's father's 83 years old he hasn't seen the car meaning hasn't pulled out in 37 years kind of a big deal we've worked really hard dan and I most of the day here it's kind of the moment of truth so I'm gonna pull the camera back there Davis file is gonna be coming from that direction and I think all of our hard work is going to be worth the effort once we see his face so I'm pretty excited so I'm gonna go hide in the corner and then wait for him to come out  David you want to go to your dad  [Music]  there you go  good like to hear that  [Music]  after seeing the car cleaned up he agreed with the Sun it's time to fully restore the family car and pass it down to his grandchildren  as long as I can  I was born in 81  [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] and as luck would have it naturally after all that work it started to thunder so we needed to pull it back inside quickly before it gets pulled back out again next week on its way to the restoration shop  [Music] Oh guys we did it mission accomplished David is actually taking the car in and getting it restored so hopefully I have some footage of that the next couple of months or years now again my mission with this video and with this job because it wasn't real job is to restore the car and kind of just motivate his dad to be like oh my gosh I remember what this looked like let's go in and kind of restore it and pass it down to the family so very cool a quick note of thanks to David a lot of times I don't get to fill me so every time I post a video I usually have five or six or seven videos that I can't post meaning you know for one reason or another the family doesn't want that on there and I can respect that in this case David did so thank you because we got to shoot a really cool video and it was a fun experience and sort of be there when his dad experienced that was certainly you know emotional off-camera and that kind of thing so thank you for allowing us to share this so if you guys liked this kind of video please subscribe and make sure you check out the Eagle Talon video where I pulled it out of the woods absolutely discussing the same kind of idea so if you dig this video I'm sure you'll like that one as always guys thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]  [Music]", "n-K8l43sZgA": "in big cities like Vancouver the need for affordable housing is obvious it's not always so evident in smaller rural communities though today we've traveled to Grand Forks and British Columbia to meet an inspiring man who is making big waves in a small city with a tiny house [Music]  hello Peter thank you very sleazy to meet you manager to meet you and how wonderful to see your gorgeous tiny house I was actually surprised at just how small it is when I saw it this is a very tiny tiny house isn't it it's a bit extreme what size is it actually it's 125 square feet inside I've always enjoyed building and small spaces and the creativity of trying to fit things into a smaller space and a couple of winters ago I was volunteering at a cold-weather shelter in Grand Forks and I was asked at that time if I would help design some spaces for the homeless and as I started thinking about that project and how to make a very inexpensive but really welcoming space for somebody who was homeless and was transitioning through that I realized that it just didn't seem right to design something that I hadn't really experienced living in and I had never experienced living in this kind of space and basically just decided that it'd be fun to build one and see what it was like to live in it and then how to make it work as you know a pod for a homeless person to transition through and the majority of the materials are found and that's one of the values I put into the building is that it be recycled repurposed and yeah that's basically how I got here that's the design process you have a background in advertising don't you yeah this is a long way from that well it's a long way from that world  what was that transition actually like for you because obviously the advertising world it's very based on material acquisition and encouraging people to desire more things and what you're really doing with this project is the exact opposite of that isn't it its opposite of that so in advertising and I've done a lot of construction and house design stuff like that in both of those I've tried to educate as well and so mine hasn't all been about acquisition and stuff I've always built small houses and I've chose what I want to advertise so it's maybe not that far away so I say that you eventually called the project my pad can you tell me a little bit about what that is I did a demonstration or a talk for the City Council trying to explain the tiny house movement and I didn't want them to immediately see my place as this tiny little sardine can and so I wanted to come at it from a different angle and so I talked about Apple having miniaturized a house and created this small house and we had the first one here in Grand Forks and it let them just forget reality for a minute and then I could talk about the small house movement and they could hear me and then I told them about fake news  yeah and it was good it made it understandable for them yeah so you know there's that advertising background going to work for you but if it actually opened the doors and you've actually made some really impressive headway with the council here in Grand Forks heaven here yeah we've got a really progressive council the planner and the building inspector and engineers are all together on small housing and sustainability in this so yeah it's a it's an exciting time right now for me well I'm very excited to have a look inside the place and see what you've done well then come on in welcome wow what an adorable space I'm really intrigued to learn about the design of this home this is a very small tiny house for full-time living how did you design the space to really work for you I started out trying to make a space that would work for anybody and halfway through decided no this is for me and I started coming up with my own parts to it it's always not seemed wise to me to have a door at the end because then you're using up a lot of floor space that isn't useful whereas this coming in from the side all of the floor space has another purpose and also I wanted very light weight and so I did the post and beam which is structurally really strong but also really light so the walls are really lightly framed what's through this door here that's the bathroom this is your bathroom out of here and that kind of made sense because it was as far away as possible from the bedroom the kitchen right and all of my plumbing and electrical and propane and everything is out that end so it's the most efficient use of the plumbing and wiring and etc perfect well can we have a look inside you bet this is really Nate the tub actually looks like it's a great size it's very deep it is deep enough that I can sit in it and have the water come up to my chest and be able to soak and I don't know if you've noticed it's a recycled freezer really yeah it's a little freezer I went up to the local landfill where they have a bunch of old freezers backed up and I sat in a bunch of different freezers until I found one that was right size for me and then you've got the composting toilet there as well yep and I've got a separate unit in there and then you're heating your water using gas propane propane yeah I love the idea of not having a tank of hot water remaining hot for a day or two well I don't use it you know it seems so wasteful so I love I love this and then over here we're moving into your kitchen and office area and everything else this is my solar fridge this is all set up for solar I'm not using the panel's right now I've got them stored because I'm in this tree blind place that I have the Sun showing but everything here is set up to be off-grid great both water and electricity and everything so this is a unit a fella in Mount best in Australia made this prototype for me 410 to adapt a chest freezer into a fridge right it's really efficient and of course when I open it the cold air doesn't fall out it's not quite as convenient as a stand-up fridge sure but I don't mind I get it's just it just trickles the power yeah that is such a clever idea because of course if you are on solar power the fridge is one of the hungriest appliances that's right house exactly anything to do with heating or cooling takes a lot of powers so actually having a super efficient unit like that it's a very clever idea yeah and in the kitchen over here you've got a good amount of space to work with for cooking yeah I find it quite adequate for me there's enough counter space plus I have the counter space over here that I can use and I don't think I've ever used two burners at the same time so it's more than enough there and seems to do me just fine you've actually allocated quite a large amount of the space of this home to your office haven't you yeah as it's turned out this is more of my living room than my original thought of a living room that if I have somebody over we usually sit here at the desk and we'll eat here that's the kitchen table as well and so it's kind of my great room you've really hit the jackpot when it comes to your parking space as well I mean the views that you get into we're looking right out onto that gorgeous River right now yeah this is a fabulous parking spot yeah it's beautiful waking up and I just sit up and have my coffee in bed and look out at that river and you know watch the deer walk the deer walk through there and they munch the ground and beavers go by with their sticks I mean it's just incredible and then you'll lounge spaces down the end can we have a look at that you betcha  now this is such a clever idea are we actually on your bed right now we're on the bed yeah so I designed this idea with the cushions where I've had five people sitting up here pretty comfortably nice distance for conversation I've enjoyed that once I found out that I don't actually entertain in my house much I go to the library I'll go to the coffee shop go to the pool etcetera you know that and that's what if somebody says you want to get together we'll go have dinner or something and so I don't set this up anymore unless somebody comes over and then does it take a long time to actually pack this all down to get into it it's moving for cushions out into the utility room it takes the amount of time it takes to walk out there and then have you also built storage and under the space yep I've got a slide-out bin underneath and all my bagging and winter clothes and boots and all that stuff are under there what's it like living in this home I love living here and the freedom of this place I don't have to think about maintenance when I'm gonna have to replace the roof cleaning I started go and it's done it I have so much time now and the cost of running this place is just about zero I've got a really low parking fee here i hook into her power at the big house and my bank accounts growing just from my pension you know my government pension it's actually growing that's you know it is crazy it never occurred to me that I wouldn't own my own own a house or a few I've often owned a few houses while I've been building and I've sold all of my property and houses and everything this is everything I've got right here and I don't think I can explain the liberation of not having a house on me if I don't like the location I'm at I can move to another one if I want to go travelling for a year I can go traveling for a year there isn't a cost of letting it just sit and I think the favorite thing of living in this tiny house for me is just the freedom and can I ask what the budget for this project I'd never occurred to me to have a budget I did keep all my bills but I haven't yet looked at them but my ballpark would probably be about 10 grand Wow yeah having been a builder and I had all the tools I needed and I could do my own electrical and plumbing and that really helped one of the really impressive projects that you're working on right now is actually a collaboration with the city of Grand Forks where you have managed to get a tiny house community greenlit which is super exciting can you tell me about that so the city right now is very progressive and it's a place I've been waiting for for many years and so while the iron's hot I've got in there with the planners who want to do this so because we have such a high number of solar hours in Grand Forks it's a really great place to do off-grid and sustainable structures and all that and having higher density in housing who really cuts the cost down and makes it much more affordable and sustainable so all of that comes together by doing a tiny house community and small house cluster house communities so that's where we're heading so you could actually be the first legal tiny house community in Canada we might be yeah it's very exciting yeah payda this is such a beautiful home that you've built for yourself I'm so impressed with how you brought all this together into such a small space to create such a wonderful and welcoming home and I'm also incredibly impressed with the work that you're doing to actually further the tiny house movement here in Canada thank you so much for sharing everything with me Peter is such an inspiring an interesting individual I find it fascinating that he spent his entire life developing a whole range of different kinds of housing options and this is the place where he has chosen to live himself when it comes to Peters story to listen that I'll take away from this is that sometimes bliss really can be moved [Music]  you [Music]", "4ynwWift_ts": "of all of the spaces we visit perhaps none capture the imagination more than a treehouse today we've traveled to Seattle Washington to meet Nelson treehouse and supply and see one of their incredible new projects [Music]  hey Garrett hey awesome to meet you mate glad you can make it welcome me too dude what can I even say about the treehouse this is so impressive pretty cool huh Nelson treehouse and supply was founded by Pete Nelson you might also know him from the TV show treehouse masters on Animal Planet Pete has been building treehouses for 40 plus years he's built over 250 treehouses and in 2010 he started Nelson treehouse and supply and basically we traveled the world building luxury liveable voice function fully furnished treehouses so tell me a little bit about the construction of this thing because this doesn't look like the sort of thing that you just throw together on your back yeah there is some pretty heavy hardware that's holding this thing up isn't there yeah so the whole treehouse is fully engineered we have our treehouse attachment bolt that basically holds the whole thing together it is 18 pounds of heat treated steel bolt right into the tree steel yoke holding two steel beams it sounds there could be an earthquake and a windstorm in this thing is not going anywhere this is definitely really well attached but the question that I have to ask is how does this actually affect the tree I mean they look quite invasive in there don't they we get that question so often and the way a tree grows is all the nutrients flows through the cambium layer which is the thin layer between the bark and the actual inside of the tree so when you install this tab basically you're making a three-inch circle and the cambium layer so really that just triggers reaction wood and makes the tree grow around the tab and makes the connection even stronger over time one of the other really unique things about this sit-up is it's actually not just attached to one tree it's actually fixed to two so how do you get around that challenge the tree house is engineered with a static tree and a dynamic tree so basically everything is bolted onto this tree and the whole platform treehouse will move with this tree that tree on the other hand is dynamic you can see up there our connection is using dynamic uplift arrestor ease that allows the tree to move in the wind and slide around and keeps the bolts intact and keeps the treehouse from getting any damage so it's kind of like you figure out which you want to be static and you figure out which tree you want to move and you engineer the tree house to kind of be dynamic and move with the forces of nature so how do these tree houses actually cope with the growth of the tree you're only going to see growth outward so you don't need to worry so much as trees growing different rates or you know this tree is going to grow five feet in this tree is going to go three because they're kind of grown from their tips and not so much at the base so the tabs really stay where you put them and that's where they're going to live and it's good to see as well that you've also utilized the space underneath the tree house yeah so this is a Kodama zone and I mean what better way to hang a swinging chair than from the bottom of the tree house that's actually one of the really cool things about tree houses as well because all of the land underneath is actually still understood isn't it right yeah so you're basically taking the foundation of the house and you know lifting it in this case 14 17 feet off the ground so there's still kind of like a ground ecosystem that can exist under the tree house well enough of being on the ground let's get in the tree yeah what setup I'll show you around okay so we have a curved stair set outfitted with natural cedar branch railing kind of a code to the treehouse life style this tree house is like 80% built from cedar you know yeah cedar stair tread cedar decking cedar siding cedar railings I mean we have a lot of cedar here in Washington and it's great because cedar is actually weather resistant so it can stand for years out in rainstorms and it's never going to rot which especially when you're this high up is really employed right yeah you don't want to fall through the floorboards definitely not right and what a great space you've got up here having especially this balcony area it really allows the house to take advantage of its location doesn't it right well I mean a big thing about having a tree house is being able to be next to the tree and so it's pretty important that every tree house has a deck and like I said we get a lot of rain so the sleeping loft actually acts as a canopy for the table here and we have a curved hog wire paneled railing here so it adds kind of a nice natural detail and one of the other things I notice obviously the treehouse itself is quite squared but you do have a lot of features that are curved in this as well kind of hiking back to the tree right right around yeah I mean it's definitely somewhat more of a modern treehouse we have a lot of 90 corners and lines and you know I think it's complemented pretty cool with the curse they're set in the curved deck and it kind of just creates that contrast between like new and modern and back to nature can we have a look inside yeah that's what we came for let's go check it out welcome to the treehouse this is really cool standing in here it feels very much like I'm actually in a normal house it's incredibly stable and it's not until I actually look out the windows that I realized yes I'm actually standing in the treehouse right now yeah I think that's a big thing about tiny living and treehouse living is that you know you want to feel at home you don't want to feel like you're living in a plastic box and so you know all the wood and the smell and the structure just really makes you feel at home so when you're actually building a treehouse to what extent does the tree dictate what you're able to do with the structure that you're building on it you're definitely confined to X amount of space because you have to build off the trees so in the design phase you know you're looking at where does this branch go where does that branch go and so you kind of build the structure to fit within the trees and so that actually drives a lot of the design processes this tree house really does look like it has been built so it could be lived in full time yeah I mean that's definitely an option we wanted to keep open just because no one losing it now doesn't mean someone can move in later and I think the place is designed with that in mind you know is that like you got your kitchen and your reading nook in your loft and it's like it has all the things at least for an extended stay at minimum so we've got the kitchen over here then yep the kitchen space for a little mini fridge you have a toaster oven and a microwave it's actually kind of impressive what they managed to sit in this little space and I say you've got to pull out table here as well yeah yeah this is just will pull out table made from some of the reclaimed materials at the end of the project and good to be resourceful yeah easy to transform the space from you know entertainment living room area so more of like a dining room table if you want to cook dinner or something and is that it close up behind you this yeah yeah this is a closet it's actually kind of built into the structure there's some beam's that cantilever out the side of the street house and this whole kind of nook was built around having a closet here so some extra storage space and just like these bins down here under the the reading nook you know those pull out and give extra storage and what's out this tool whew I'm glad you asked we have an outdoor shower kind of cool oh no way yep what better way to get in touch with nature than literally reaching out and grabbing a tree branch while you're taking a shower I'll say showering and the canopy what could you ask cool it's hard to beat man it's really hard to be kind of a complemented with this corrugated siding it creates privacy and still really allows you to feel like you're outside and then up here still to go we've got the sleeping area yeah yeah so you know there's a whole queen bed up here right above the entryway that you walk in and you access it via this kind of cool rustic ladder why don't we head up and take a look let's do it oh this is so nice up here there's a lot of people who don't really like the idea of a sleeping loft because of accessibility issues but I think if accessibility is not a problem then it's definitely a more efficient use of the space I mean this whole area is deceivingly large you know you come up the ladder and you almost feel like you're in a separate room there's this aesthetic about it that like you've almost entered into like a zone you know that's totally different from the space below and with a treehouse like this of course you have to have skylight yeah skylights I mean you can lay in bed and literally look right up at the canopy of the tree there's even like enough room to stand up and from up here there's a great view of the rest of the house as well right I mean it feels spacious you know for such a small space this is a really functional home but being a treehouse of this nature there's also a ton of engineering that's gone into it what kind of cost would you be looking at to build something like this with a custom steel substructure fully engineered material cost labor cost you're probably looking at about $150,000 so it's not super cheap but when you think about everything that's going into it it's not super expensive either is it right I mean it's essentially a fully functioning home but 17 feet off the ground so a big part of that is the labor and the steel substructure and the engineering and all the thought that goes in to making it safe so when you talk about that there is obviously this real engineering factor to building treehouses is there a big DIY element do people actually go out and build these themselves or do you guys not recommend that yeah we've actually recently with the whole tiny house movement seen a whole lot of desire from people to do DIY builds and we actually sell the hardware to people online all the time and we have multiple videos that instruct people how to install our hardware so I'd say that is definitely becoming more and more trending as the scene kind of expands we really do want to give the power to the people and give them the opportunity if they can't afford 150 thousand dollar house they can go and DIY it so what would you say your absolute favorite thing about treehouses is I'd say immediately what comes to mind is to escape from reality you know you open up the front door and you walk in and you're kind of just like totally taken aback from all your world troubles and you're just like taken back down to Ground Zero and basically just become a kid again so that stress-free feeling that is I think so important ever since I was a kid I have been obsessed with tree houses and getting to walk into this space until this home is an absolute dream come true for me thank you so much for sharing it with me going - pleasure to meet you ma'am thanks man I think this home proves that treehouses are not just for kids yeah it's adventurous yet maybe a little bit crazy but when you think about all the engineering that's gone into it this is an incredibly safe and sturdy home perfectly well-suited to full-time living and if it were up to me I'd be moving in tomorrow [Music] you", "-9JF7Zifc-M": "the number one question that we get over and over again is what do you wish you had known before you made the shift to your off-grid living and some people are asking that because they are maybe thinking about living off-grid themselves and they want to be well prepared some people are asking that just cuz they want to know because it's an interesting thing to find out what is different what feels different and what are the things that we didn't know so we're going to show you the ten things that we wish we had known before we went off the grid here we go solar power is easier than you think it took me a long time to get comfortable with the idea of all of these different solar components and it was all so confusing but there's a lot of good literature out there that kind of simplifies it and you're not going to get it horribly wrong there might be in efficiencies in your system but it's going to work not no matter what you do but you can do a lot of different combinations of things and still get solar power still have a set battery bank that will charge your devices and do the bare minimum of what you need because after you've lived without power at all for a while your needs are really pretty low so any amount of solar power is worth doing plants can't grow where there's no soil so we've got a great piece of land but we got a great piece of land where the soil with not rich and prepared for farming we wasted some time or first year trying to grow plants in the soil without realizing that our first job was to create soil so we have a number of ways of doing that just bringing in any kind of organic matter um from various kinds of manure to UM grass clippings or leaves we now use a chicken tractor and to use our chicken manure and to really create soil even right in the middle of our garden plot where we just had clay dry soil before we do a lot of sheet mulching and um we're building our earth so that when we plant the plant from them they'll actually grow water runs downhill maybe you knew that already so we have a spring that's up the hill from where we set up our yurt and it took us a long time to figure out a really easy way to get pressurized water well that water source is above where we want to use water so why not just hook it up the moral of that story is gravity-fed water systems are a lot easier than you think and it's just worth hooking it up and experimenting and seeing what it's able to do in our case it's able to actually run a small water heater and run our sink and pretty much everything else that we need to do all that matters because carrying water is the worst the literal worst carrying water is so bad in fact that we aren't going to demonstrate it for you we carry our water in 5-gallon buckets all winter long this will be our third winter of doing that and if all goes according to our very very detailed and careful plan this is our last winter of it and that's good because it's just it's back-breaking labor we carry our water down this down for the spring all winter long in containers like this one can you see that it's a five-gallon container and we do have a sled we do have ways to bring it down the hill that make it easier but it's still it's pretty demoralizing to carry water so I I would say we we knew that it was going to be hard but we didn't actually realize how hard it is going to be anyway that you can get around that by creating plumbing systems and even doing the hard work of digging your plumbing underground so that won't freeze it's completely worth it batteries run out LED lights are a really efficient way to go the bulb that we put in our new light fixture is a 60 watt equivalent but it only draws nine and a half watts which just barely sips off of our little battery bank so that beats the crap out of the battery powered camp lantern that we used for so long also we now have rechargeable headlamps these are expensive but they will never go bad so instead of buying a whole bunch of triple-a batteries all the time and throwing them out we just plug these in and recharge them bears like trash okay so we already knew that before we moved out here technically but I think we didn't realize what a priority that was when we had a bear come and visit us we had created conditions that were ideal for a bear to move in and he was with us for a couple of days it was not a safe situation for me or for my kids so if you're thinking well I know that bears like trash but I think it's more important for me to do XY and Z than it is to secure my trash in an area where a bear might pass through I suggest that you reconsider those priorities we have secured our trash and since then it's very possible that the bear ambles through now and then but there's no reason for him to stay or her to stay there's no reason for them to hang out and move in and we sure are safer and happier because of it firewood is a ton of work so every year we have to fill this woodshed it takes about five cords of wood or so to get us through the winter and that's a lot of work getting it all over here and split and cut into the right shape and size and making sure it's all dry and actually useful as firewood so far we've been able to get by on limbs from trees that we cut down for lumber and off cuts of lumber and not really cutting down a whole ton of trees just for firewood but it's still a lot of work to get it over here the the long-term plan is to do a rocket mass heater for the house and we would have liked to do one for the year as well it is a huge savings on the amount of firewood that you go through so anything that you can do to increase the efficiency of burning wood for heat and for cooking do it because creating that fuel is just it's a lot more work than you want to be doing yurts are better at cold weather than they are at hot weather we were psychologically prepared for the winter to be difficult in our half home half tent yurts but we underestimated the kind of brilliant design of a yurt if it's insulated it holds heat very very well and we also underestimated the extent to which hot air would be trapped in the summertime so that became a solution that needed to be found in the summer months we installed a fan and this also has to do with our particular design of the yurt that we I don't have a large opening at the top and we were concentrating on keeping heat in but we solved that problem with the solar-powered fan in the top of the yurt and now our summers are as comfortable as our winters temporary is longer than you think so our plan before we had ever done any part of living off the grid was to be in the yurt for a year well it's going to be at least three years before we have our house habitable so I I guess the takeaway from that is you just don't know until you're doing it so if you are setting up a temporary situation you might as well make it comfortable enough to be in for a while because you just don't know how long it's going to take to get everything done and also you just have to the the ambitious planner part of you has to be kind to the part of you that actually has to live through it you can do things you didn't know you could do so I guess the moral is that you can teach an old dog new tricks I'm the old dog we were doing okay we're doing fine we've learned a lot and we're still learning but an attitude of learning and an attitude of being okay with accepting that the lessons that we need to learn are sometimes kind of elementary is allowing us to make the changes that we have always dreamed of making and it's all right there in front of you and you just got to pay attention and react and not be afraid and look nobody's died so far I hope you're getting our little joke here which is that a lot of the things that we needed to know we actually really did know maybe we didn't know we knew them or we didn't have the courage to act on them but a lot of the things that you need to know to create alternative lifestyle you've already got so if you're making a chef like this we wish you luck have a great time you", "QA5fh29rhLs": "hi I'm Ben and this is the house I built out of shipping containers now I've been interested in shipping container architecture for quite some time but I had a really hard time finding good information about how to get building permits or how much would it cost well we did the research we documented everything that we did and now we're so excited to share with you what we learned so check it out this is episode 1 where we'll talk about buying containers getting building permits and pouring a concrete foundation in the spring of 2018 I bought 10 acres of land in Joshua Tree California it's a square piece of land about 650 by 650 feet and it has this nice little mountain right in the middle while I was waiting for the surveyor to finish up the site drawings I went ahead and ordered two shipping containers no I had heard like a lot of people have that you can get shipping containers for really cheap but in California you have to use a one trip conditioned container if you're turning it into a permitted house this is just so that you can provide documentation for what's been inside the container just to ensure that there hasn't been any radioactive or toxic stuff in there I also didn't order typical containers I ordered hi cubes which were a foot taller than a standard shipping container this is gonna give me more room for insulation running wiring and of course because we're in California sprinkler systems for fire suppression originally I was only planning on using one 40-foot container to build one tiny house but then I thought it'd be really nice to have a guest bedroom and bathroom for visitors and then when I checked in with my local building department they informed me that there was a 700 square foot minimum for houses which meant I would have to add a third container so I figured a home office and workshop would be great now even before I got the permit I was allowed to move up to 50 cubic yards of soil so I went ahead and started flattening out the piece where I wanted to place the house I rented a bulldozer and hired an operator to flatten out this whole area and it only took him two days we then started digging for the monolithic slabs which are going to support the containers  originally we tried to do this with hand tools but there was so much rock in the soil was really slow going so we let the machine do the work and do we just use hand tools to clean it up afterwards not only are there big chunks of rock mixed into the soil there's hole veins of stone that go through it we use to buy lumber to define the perimeter of the slab and we drove stakes into the ground to hold these boards in place wood stakes kept breaking so we switched to these steel stakes that already had holes in them for screws and they worked really well  [Music] we had a whole bunch of 20-foot long pieces of rebar delivered to the site and we began to reinforcement for the concrete the structural engineer had specified the size of the rebar and the layout so all we had to do was follow those drawings and wire it all together I focused on cutting all the short vertical pieces while the rest of the crew wired them all together this isn't the most difficult work but it does help to have a plan the whole thing starts to get pretty heavy because you're basically creating one big steel cage of rebar all wired together [Music] we spread out the 10-millimeter moisture barrier and then shoveled clean sand on the top of that I had always wondered how builders keep the rebar from just falling to the bottom of the formwork and they use these things called Dobies they're just little concrete blocks with wires embedded in them and they act as spacers this was a lot of work in hundred degree weather and it really made me appreciate all the stuff that goes on inside a monolithic piece of concrete originally we planned on embedding all of the drain pipes for the plumbing into the concrete slab but after laying out all the pieces and wrestling around trying to get them in the right position relative to the rebar we just felt we weren't gonna be accurate enough to line it up with exactly where the container would need to be so we just switched it out for a simpler option and just made the final drain go through the slab this just means we'll have to do the plumbing within the floor of the container itself now this is as far as we can go before having the building permits we certainly can't pour any concrete until we get the final sign-off California is a pretty regulation intensive state and here's the process we had to go through the process starts with getting the site surveyed in addition to measuring and marking out the topographical features which is really useful for showing how the site will drain the surveyor also researches the history of the site and defines all the boundaries and setbacks next up came the preliminary architectural design where we laid out all the spaces and features this design then goes to the structural engineer who creates a set of structural details and performs calculations to prove that this building will meet all the code requirements the building department gave us the option of either having the architect or engineer stamp the drawings we then compiled these designs into the construction documents and added in a whole series of reports and studies and forms that are all required by San Bernardino County is a complicated and expensive process because with each step you often have to go back to the previous one and have those drawings or documents updated all right done with permits time to have some fun and it's concrete day we have three separate slabs and the smallest one is inaccessible for a truck to pull all the way up to so we're gonna have to pump the concrete the crew got there a few hours ahead of the trucks just to make sure everything was good with the forms and to spray them down with water the first truck pulled up to the pump and started releasing concrete into the hopper  it then gets pumped through the hose and delivered into the forms  there was only the few guys standing around with shovels fill in the gaps with the form with dirt and rocks as the concrete levels rose this wasn't exciting but a little bit stressful today because you have to order all the trucks in advance and they kept coming about 15 minutes apart so we had to make sure we were emptying one so that we'd be ready for the next one the gray plastic pipes that are sticking up out of the forms are PVC conduit that will allow us to run electrical lines between the containers now the majority of these slabs are going to be covered by the containers but we still had them smoothed out a bit pretty other slabs the trucks could just back all the way up and the concrete could just come right down the chute  [Music] altogether we used about six trucks and 45 yards of concrete  in addition to smoothing out the top surface the guys also created some lines through the surface of the concrete these are to create control joints which will allow for more expansion and contraction of the concrete without creating unwanted cracks we also use some plywood boxes to create some openings in the slab and this is just giving us a little bit more room to line up where the drain for the toilet goes the last thing we did was to use an edging tool to do a little bit of a round over at the edges of each slab so the most common question I've gotten so far is why did I choose to do a slab on grade Foundation and I get it it seems like an awful lot of concrete for a container which is self-supporting well slap one grade isn't the first choice that I had I originally wanted to do sort of a pier Foundation and I was very concerned with how I would level it since I don't have a lot of experience sort of setting these things and so I was interested in doing some concrete piers with a steel beam that I could then level on site that I would weld the container to so that I sketched it out and sent it to the structural engineers well they were initially worried about lateral support considering seismic activity were in California we have to worry about earthquakes and with seismic activity you have to worry about the lateral load of the foundation not just about how it takes weight straight down so we then worked on a second version of this design where we connected the footings underneath the concrete columns so that it creates sort of a ring and that add would add enough strength and stability but when I talked to the building department they said that this would be classified as a crawlspace or at least at the area underneath the container would and if that was the case it would have to be at least 18 inches between the bottom of the container and the finished dirt and the container floor itself is pretty thick and so I didn't want to have my finished floor to be almost two to two-and-a-half feet off of the ground because then if I do any decks or staircases out I have to have all these rail which blocked the views so at this point considering both the challenges for what it was originally a really simple foundation adding in seismic support and then and knowing that I'd have to raise the finished floor way off the ground I scrapped this idea and started thinking about monolithic concrete foundations now first I said well can I just do a perimeter beam that goes all the way around it doesn't really need to have a concrete top right like the containers only sitting on those edges so the engineers worked it out but that concrete ridge beam because again it doesn't have the lateral support from the actual top of the slab what had to be pretty thick so it ended up not being that much more concrete than just doing an entire slab and when you actually look at how much concrete is per yard it was like a cost difference of like a hundred dollars per slab now that doesn't mean the slab is the best idea I'm sure there's a lot of other foundation types that would have worked on but with what we were working on here with this particular building department and maybe just the limitations of our structural engineering firm this is what seem to make the most sense across the most basis ease even though it didn't really seem perfect for any one thing now my architecture firms in Boston on the East Coast and a lot of our work is out there so we're used to doing basements or foundations that go well below the frost line but out here in Southern California that's less of a concern so at least we had that going for us which made the foundation a lot easier and relatively affordably priced I know there's a lot of Engineers architects and builders out there in the audience so let me know in the comments section below what you think would work or would have worked better for this type of foundation also any little tricks or tips that you might have for the rest of the audience about foundation design form work what to consider when doing big concrete pours like that would also be appreciated so I hope that clears it up why we ended up going with a slab on grade foundation I know when you see houses like this a lot so many decisions seem arbitrary and I'm looking at architecture all the time being like why did they do that but before you sort of assume that somebody's dumb although probably plenty of other reasons to do so ask them why because there's always these other considerations that we may not see just by looking at the photograph on the next

spirit and your body and that is exactly what this next tiny house does in a very unique way [Music]  hi Jamie hi so are you lovely to meet you to meet you this house is absolutely beautiful thank you and these gardens are stunning first of all can I just ask a little bit about where we are right now and how you actually came to be here on this property yeah we are at this circle Yoga Shaolin and it's a training facility for yoga teachers so we do 200 our 500 hour all the way up through yoga therapy trainings here and it's also a community so I was involved with them through yoga circles and it's just worked out that I was also building this tiny house and it was like I had found my people so I've spent the last two years building this and then moved it here in May and kind of finished it up and got everything in place Here I am and in that respect a tiny house is the perfect way to join an existing community isn't it because you have your own space it's all yours and as you like it and there's a place you can retreat to but when you want to be in the community it's right out here yeah I actually found that through personal experience I had lived in another yoga community in which I was you know in the main building and in sort of you know you have your own room but it's very different all the noises are right there so I knew that community was important to me and it was something that I wanted but I knew I needed to have my own space and have my own domain to make that work so you can have a space to retreat to like you said and who's this this is Dahle I done poor town beautiful dog yeah I'm not sure what sort of mix she is but she is my favorite accessory she's so beautiful so you named your tiny house turtle medicine tell me a little bit about that well there's lots that goes behind that I didn't name it that at first but as it started taking shape I started learning more about Native American traditions and turtle medicine and what that means and then in the native traditions everything at a certain time is medicine so say you were seeing lots of turtles around in your life and you could inquire into turtle medicine and what nature is showing you and turtle medicine is about slowing down it's about adapting to your environment so I was building this and filled Missouri and reclaiming everything so I just kind of started inquiring as to what was around what houses were going down and kind of just had to wait until the right thing arrived so it was sort of a way of reminding myself again and again that this was about a process and that process can't be hurried you can just relax into it again and again so through all the obstacles just reminding myself to adapt and adjust and slow down and be good with where things are what was it that inspired you to use so many reclaimed or recycled materials in this home the area that I lived there was a ton of materials to be reclaimed a lot of houses going down and all of that stuff was just going to the landfill and so it was sort of my way of not only reclaiming the materials but also reclaiming a certain part of my life by kind of returning to my roots and being a part of kind of the nitty gritty of the Ozarks you know the trailer in looking for it we kind of went all in through Southeast Missouri and the cedar siding came from a barn so I took down two barns and gathered materials from probably about six or seven different houses that were all going down so I extracted the windows you know pull the doors out of their spots so that was a lot of work but it was well worth it because I found things I really loved one of the things that immediately interest me about the design and concept of this house is that you've designed this to help encourage movement tell me how that all came about I've always been into movement as an athlete or a trainer and then now it's a yoga teacher but more specifically as I started to come do trainings here at the circle yoga shala I started to learn about all the ways that humans aren't really moving anymore so for example these stall bars I built to not only be for use in you know like mobility and range of motion exercises for the arms and shoulders but it's also a ladder up to the roof which is where my yoga mat kind of stays and where I do most of my yoga practices for now why the weather is really nice yeah I call it the top of the world and just in general here you've got such a lovely outdoor living space as well don't you I do yeah and it really made it homey so much faster you know to be able to have this space and I've always wanted around porch well I cannot wait to check out what you've done on the inside can we take a look yeah let's check it out all right oh this is absolutely gorgeous I love the style of this place Thanks yeah I love it too I always tell people there's not anything in here that I don't love that's a good feeling you can really say that everything in here has had a life before and comes into this space telling a story doesn't it it does yeah pretty much everything has a story for example this was an old flower box so I made this and the open shelving with the parts from the fire box so these holes were to drain the water from the flowers and now they're candle holders did you have sort of a vision for what you wanted to create in mind or was this all just completely dictated by what you found yeah the first thing that really determined a lot is this leaded glass window which I call the miracle window because it's a miracle it didn't break along the ways because we extracted it from this house which was a brick house so it was really hard to get out and then managed to get it in here so it was kind of the centerpiece of a lot of the design and the wood beams so that came from a barn that we took down and I just love them and so I knew I wanted those to be exposed in this portion of it and from there I had originally thought I would do stairs but then I found that ladder and so it all sort of just adapted from there when necessary the design in here is really nice walking into this part of the home everything just feels really nice open light spacious tell me about how you've said everything out in here yeah so you know this main living space I really wanted it to have sort of that great room feel that it was high ceilings and connected to the kitchen and sort of just a unified living space so I kind of designed it to where I would come in there's two doors would come in that other door and be able to have that as the utility space and then that this could be just you know for living and keeping beautiful and organized it's actually quite Spartan isn't it you haven't cluttered it up with a lot of furniture and everything yeah so part of that movement aspect that we were talking about is that sitting on the floor or you know sitting in different positions is really good for the body so not having chairs that kind of put you into a thinking or a passive position but using your hip rotation and your core to sit upright but also still being able to have kind of lounge spaces that are comfortable and cozy is that still relaxing nor well doesn't that look pretty relaxing a chill that looks pretty relaxed you know give me a book from popcorn and so all these benches are modular so I can move these over there or I can put them into the center and I use this wall for my projector so I'll kind of just move this over there and and sit and watch music videos mostly I really like music videos on the wall so I find it really comfortable and I can use the benches also for laying on or relaxing that's kind of why I decided to go with these benches that are a little bit less pushy or cozy than most houses would be but I find them really useful and then down here we have your kitchen space yes beautiful live-edge countertop yes this is silver maple and all of the live edge actually the walnut and the maple that are on the benches and this maple all came from wood that was at the same properties as the barns that were coming down and the houses that I reclaimed this window and several of the windows from and so all the trees were going down you know probably 20 old-growth trees and so I got on Craigslist and I call it a sawmill guy I said will you split I mean of the wood with me for processing it so they all you know have a lot of sentimental value to me in that way because it was kind of all part of this process of just starting to try to find you know what was available and I knew I would have some wood slab but this one I chose because I really like the kind of bump out feature here for a little bit of extra counter space no sink in here just yet though no so where I'm at now is not connected to water so there's no need for the sink I sort of used the kitchen right now mostly for supplements or making an omelet something pretty basic and then I just either use my water jug to wash dishes or go to the main house to wash everything up again just looking at this kitchen there's so much beauty and character that's just been poured into this space thank you all of these mugs and everything it all just looks like it's so at home in here yeah I made all those mugs you make these yeah beautiful yeah so every time you know you have a cup of tea in it and a cup that you made it has a certain feeling as well and then I loved how you've done this open storage in the kitchen too yeah so I'm really into herbs and spices and so I knew I wanted to have a lot of open shelving and I also think it's really beautiful to see all the different roots and plants and yeah designed it to be really open so you can see all that and have it easily accessible when you're making your potions gorgeous and this all gets used it's not just decoration oh yeah it all gets used I'm a chai fanatic no I think several varieties of chai I get to hang out while I make my chai so it's that's really what I was going for first thing it's kind of one of the things I do so to wake up and get some movement in and be able to do that right here because I also have a tendency to walk away from the chai and it boils over and now I don't have to worry about that well there you go no that is super cold tell me about how you've done that yeah so this bar goes straight through underneath the loft and really it's only purpose is to be able to hang because this is something that has sort of moved out of the movement profile I guess you could say of human beings and is really important for a head and neck alignment so usually a lot of people that I see as a yoga therapist this is what we're focused on so I wanted to incorporate that making it as seamless and is integrated into my life as possible and so what do we head through here so this is sort of the start of the utility area so my closet is here and then there's a fridge back behind here and I sort of made the curtain so that it could go pretty much any direction so that then this area still feels nice and clean and uncluttered and then through here is your bathroom I'm guessing yeah so it's sort of a bathroom and a dressing room I call it so the toilet is composting there's a big compost operation here so although the toilets are composting that just makes it so much easier doesn't it when you're actually on a property whether you've got existing infrastructure for doing all those yes it's a whole learning curve so to just be able to get in on the process was hugely influential and actually putting the blue in here and having this for winter I think will be really lovely to not have to walk to the outhouse every time yeah definitely go yeah so not having a shower in here is that a problem no there's a whole shower room here I think if I was off the grid or off by myself of course I would want a shower and it's plumbed to be able to have a shower and it has an RV hookup for water so if that becomes the case or the next place I move that makes more sense then I can just switch everything up and the shower will come out right here and it's actually designed to be able to have an outdoor in an indoor shower but it'll kind of grow with my off-grid lifestyle well should we check out the sleeping loft and see what you've done up there yeah let's go all right now I'm pretty interested in seeing how this ladder is going to look because it doesn't look like the easiest thing to get up and down it isn't and I tell people that if they can't get up into my loft they can't come so I usually use one of these top bar kind of help and then just get a cheek on there in your ear and it's actually nice to have the handles at the top it is isn't it the way that this letter is actually folding over it's pretty unusual but it actually makes accessing the loft a lot simpler doesn't it beautiful space up here - thanks yeah this is all that same wood that I was saying is from the outside the cedar so hopefully it'll keep the mods away the floor is just a parquet floor but I put a geometrical shape underneath it so that was fun to get to do all those little things and I thought it would feel crowded but to sleep here really is super cozy and with the window right by my head I really love it and above us now we've got the deck area still right yeah can we take that out yeah let's do it more climbing let's do it so I want to show you one of my favorite ways to get down alright sydandval so involves hanging so kind of just lower yourself down and get your first morning stretch nice and drop but be sure to bend your knees as you hit the ground that is seriously cool and I just love how playful it's made this base you know everything just becomes so functional and I just love the way that the whole home encourages you to move yeah yeah there's one more element I can show you that I got from my sawmill friend I saw this burly thing and I was reminded me of a climbing hold but it's you know made a beautiful wood so if you're climbing you can also kind of get a little swing up and then this here is how you access the roof yeah so these are stall bars and then just also a letter nice are you coming up absolutely okay oh now that is cool I love how your yoga mats just already up here yeah this is where I use it and it's rubber so it's waterproof okay please tell me that those pipes have a rooftop bathtub can dream it you can do it and they'll be water up here yeah so there's water and electricity and this part is set up for solar panels should that ever be necessary or there's also a spot for batteries down in the front so I kind of imagine moving towards more and more off-grid and the view up here this is pretty hot debate isn't it it is up in the trees so how long have you actually been living in the home now I guess it would be three and a half months so three months that's still pretty fresh how are you finding it yeah I really love it I'm back and forth between here in Springfield where I still teach yoga and kind of run my business from there so every time I come home to it I spend about 70 percent of the time here I'm still really thrilled and it feels like coming home to a really restful place which is really nice how much did this home actually cost you to build well if you don't count what was bartered but you do count all the tools I had to buy but 12,000 total that's pretty remarkable what was the secret to keeping the cost down that love location the other would be just building everything myself do you know that doesn't count all of the ridiculous and I'm working on this yeah so from the materials coming from a barn that I just I had access to because otherwise it was going to be thrown away so the things that I built it with were you know had $0 in most cases most of the expense would be the electrical the plumbing screws the whole process was allowing myself to do what I really wanted to do at my deepest core and and that was to build things and to engage with process and engage with community in a way that I'm offering my whole itself to what's happening into what I'm doing so I learned one that I can finish something and that act of following a process from start to finish I learned about process itself so it also helped me to see where I am in my own process and observing all of the things that I would do you know when things weren't going well and things were going well and even now that it's finished sort of the feelings of safety and comfort that I have now because of taking these steps to sort of get grounded and and stabilized in my own life so it taught me that my practice is working and that's hopeful and I think that that is something that we could all use a dose of right now Jamie your home is truly beautiful I love all of the materials that you have put into this I love its story and I love how adventurous you have made this place congratulations on creating something truly special thank you there's little question about it that as modern humans we have definitely become way too sedentary and what I love about this home is just the way that it always encourages movement and movement in ways that we wouldn't normally use our bodies in day to day life this place really is something very unique [Music] you", "w1cPq3obfrw": "[Music]", "aVWJMcOptR8": "many people struggle with food and other consumer goods because they're simply using them wrong just because everyone else always eats a food or uses a consumer good a certain way doesn't mean it's the best way to consume that product did you know there's a simple solution to dealing with bones and chicken wings getting the shell off a hard-boiled egg and getting more for your money out of your ink and toner cartridges prepare to be amazed at this video of ten things you're consuming wrong number 10 yogurt if you like to eat yogurt you may occasionally find a liquid that collects on the top and think it's gross pouring it down the drain but not so fast all you're really doing is pouring essential nutrients down the drain it's much healthier to consume the liquid because it contains calcium protein and b12 three of the healthiest nutrients found in yogurt you don't have to drink the liquid just stir it back into your yogurt before eating or just shake the yogurt beforehand so you don't have to see it separated at the top that liquid is known as whey and little miss muffet eats it so you should too number nine chicken wings it's easy to think there's no wrong way to eat them since they're finger food right while it may be socially acceptable to eat chicken wings anyway you want dealing with the bones can be a hassle so don't just wing it that's just foul play because there is an easy way to solve this problem here's how you can debone the wing with ease hold your chicken wing like a game controller and twist the ends back and forth until you feel the cartilage break then pull the second bone out the end this leaves one bone in the wing you then put the chicken wing in your mouth and pull it off the other bone leaving you with only chicken to chew this is the best way because you get to eat all the meat at once without the risk of encountering a bone when you chew number eight hard-boiled eggs for many people the hardest part of cooking hard-boiled eggs is peeling the shell off if you're struggling with this or avoiding making hard-boiled eggs altogether so you don't have to deal with it chances are you're doing it wrong the best solution is to add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water before you begin which raises the pH of the water boil the eggs for about 12 with two inches of water above the eggs when you're done cooking and I've cooked the eggs crack both ends on the counter and peel off some of the shell so you have a hole at the top and bottom of the egg now comes the fun part all you have to do is blow on one end of the egg and the shell should come right off they may be hard-boiled but they don't have to be hard peeled number seven oranges oranges are a good source of vitamin C and folate but they can be a hassle to peel here's an easy way and you'll be annoyed you didn't know sooner all you have to do is cut off the top and bottom of the orange then make a slice in the peel and simply unroll your orange it's now neatly sectioned and easy to eat sort of like a fruity Toblerone aren't you glad we told you this simple orange hack number six toothpaste it's not a food but toothpaste is also expended by use so it's cost-effective to consume it properly the first mistake people make when using toothpaste relates to the amount of it they use many people run a long strip of toothpaste across the surface of bristles on their toothbrush but this is actually too much toothpaste a pea-sized amount is plenty another common mistake people make with toothpaste is rinsing their mouth immediately after brushing this isn't actually what you're supposed to do not rinsing allows the fluoride to stay in the mouth and be better absorbed by the teeth protecting them from cavities toothpaste also has a few use hacks that can help you with cleaning something other than your pearly whites you can use it to clean your car's headlights or to get persistent strong smells like garlic or onions off your hands number five ink and toner if you print things even occasionally you probably groan every time you get one of those to replace ink messages on your computer screen however replacing the cartridge right away isn't the most cost effective solution frequently these messages pop up when your ink has just reached a certain low level but there is still some left with ink cartridges simply take out the cartridge and use an unbent paper clip to pop the reset button on the cartridge then continue printing until you're printing gets light or totally non-existent then will you have to replace the cartridge with the larger toner cartridges take them out and shake them up then put them back in often you can get dozens more pages out of a cartridge by doing this number four leftover pizza mm-hmm leftover pizza is good in so many ways some people like eating it cold while others prefer to reheat it but if you're using a microwave or even a traditional oven you may not be getting the best tastiest flavor and texture from yesterday's pizza so what's the best way to reheat it fold your pizza slices up and put them in a waffle iron this keeps the crust crispy and even remounts the cheese plus you get a cool little grid shape on your pizza you can even fill the little squares with that extra sauce or Parmesan cheese you get from the pizza place number three apples an apple a day is supposed to keep the doctor away or so the saying goes I don't know about that but a whole apple a day will leave more room in your trash or recycling bin that's why you gotta eat it all that's right you can eat the whole Apple including the core the whole idea of the core being inedible is just a myth sure apple seeds do release cyanide when digested but unless you finally chew and eat about 200 apple seeds or about 20 apple cores you won't receive a fatal dose oh and you shouldn't peel apples either as the skin contains vitamins the best way to consume your Apple is to rinse it thoroughly start from the bottom and eat the whole thing skin stem and all number two liquid soap if you have to keep buying liquid soap frequently you may feel like you're washing a lot of money down the drain fortunately there's an easy way to save money and still get your hands clean wrap a rubber band around the neck of the pump this lets it go down partway but not all the way so you get a smaller amount of soap with each pump don't worry your hands will get just as clean and you won't have to buy soap as often you can stretch your soap even further by adding water when the pump bottle starts to run low you'll be able to stretch the bubbles a lot farther before you have to buy another refill number one pistachios pistachios are healthy nuts and they have pretty fun commercials too but sometimes getting them open is no fun especially when you're left with the neglected ones that you can't get the shell off thankfully there's an easy solution for this that might save you from going nuts just take another pistachio shell and insert it into the crack you should be able to fit it into most small slits with a bit of pressure and this will allow you to easily push apart the two sides of the shell this works because the shells are very strong this will prevent those yummy pistachio nuts from hibernating indefinitely have you been consuming these wrong the whole time and what hacks help you consume products more

"designing a tiny house that will perfectly meet the needs of a family of four is no light task yet that is exactly what this next couple have done building a beautiful farmhouse style tiny home that is packed with great design ideas [Music] today in the how's it going hey Joe nice to meet you this is such a beautiful looking home you know and before we talk about the house can we just talk about I know we can't take all the credit for it yeah it's a beautiful place and that was one of the big keys of Brina the tiny house here was the location yeah you've got two young girls yeah and this is literally a playground here isn't it you know what they are perfectly setup for everything that they could ever want or need and I think that's what made the transition from living in a normal sized house to living small so easy and so seamless for the girls and for us actually yeah and that's the key even other outdoors most of the time and that was one of the big goals of it it's working out very well and we're just so so happy to be here you've even got a stock tank swimming pool with floating Swan that's all away and ridiculous it is honestly we were talking about it and I'm like that's one of the things that if we build a big enough deck we 100% wanted to do you know the Pinterest stock tank pool with this one this is like a six-foot one but we wanted even large no I mean a bigger Swan you might that might come having such an incredible outdoor space like this must just make tiny house living so much easier honestly like this deck it's vital Vegas different and we are always outside and we probably will be and you know spring summer of yeah only time we might not be able to utilize it is winter right if it's snowy but it has just made the world of difference yeah that's when you just need to check a heater in the pool that's actually the next plan that's we've actually already looked into doing that turning into a stock tank hot tub yeah and what is the story with this land here because the setup is just ridiculously perfect you've got sheep running around in the background and a fantastic space here so Joel and I recently sold a home that we had designed and built ourselves and we purchased property which we had dreamed of purchasing six kurz we were able to clear it and we were in the process of building another house but we weren't able to put the tiny house on our piece of land because our land isn't like it's never been built on yeah we know much to still do on the property to make it livable like it would have been a little bit of a headache trying to prep the spot for the tiny house and have electricity and everything that we need so that's kind of where we went just five minutes up the road is where my parents live and this is where we have parked the tiny house they have five acres of their own clearly they are already completely set up with trampolines sand boxes for the kids so really in the end I think it turned out beautifully for our family and it's your childhood home is very good and this is where I grew up and honestly it holds so many memories of the kids being outside and that's part of the reason why we moved to a tiny house was to be outside have more family time and now we're close to family which is the best really closer yeah so I think our situation is maybe a little bit different than your typical tiny house maybe family or individuals is that we were looking at this for a certain period of time so Joel and I are so fortunate enough to be able to build another house and we were looking to see what would be the best fit for that kind of in-between time as soon as we saw the tiny house we thought you know what this is a great opportunity to just show our girls what it's like to live small live simply and not focus so much on the big houses you know a lot of stuff a lot of clutter and and maybe just focusing down and what's truly important and that that ultimately boils down to family for myself as an airline pilot as a career it was very important for me especially that when I'm away I know that Emma and the girls are safe and have that feeling of safety and security here in Italy that was what really was really great about us being up at the tiny house and her parents property so what was it that inspired the build at the tiny house I remember seeing the first tiny house on HGTV and I remember thinking like I would love to get the chance to design a space that not only had the constraints of small living but something that would still feel like a even though it is so you know much smaller than the conventional home so when I first saw that I remember kind of slowly putting the idea into Joel's head and this was even before we had children so it was kind of like should we do it as a young couple or should we try to you know work our way up in the property ladder but once we found out that we were gonna go for it I was like 100% we're doing a farm right but in the country it's gonna be a farm house yeah I feel like a farm house to us especially in Canada like almost symbolizes like the cozy home that you know the homestead where you grow your own garden and that's why we tried to incorporate kind of mature window boxes and good little gardens to try and make it feel like it was an established farmhouse hmm you've definitely nailed that really quintessentially beautiful farmhouse look in this can you talk to me about the construction and some of the materials that we used the house is constructed of 2x4 and then it's cedar clad and the exterior as well standard house windows and so it's very insulated as well the tin roof and spray foam insulation so I mean you could heat this thing with a candle essentially it's so so well insulated we barely ever use the heating and what size is the tiny house it's so it's 30 feet long eight and a half wide thirteen and a half high we wanted to actually do it a bit longer but it's a bit of a tricky driveway to get it up here so the builders they recommended 30 feet to be the longest and actually we're frankly quite glad I am so glad we didn't go bigger because I feel like when you're going for a tiny house you still try to downsize your living and make living more simple I think one but for us and if she was it's such a such a new thing to us they want my soul go as big as we can right cause big it's less of a transition but you know what two feet or what now you know this is this is perfect you know and every week that we live in it the house feels bigger yeah yeah and I still lose things and then my Soto's even though we've gone it's a time and I lose things always yeah and maybe that'll never change yeah that's the home just looks so wonderful from the outside and I cannot wait to see what you've done on the inside come on in take a thank you oh this is just beautiful thank you so much okay you know why it feels so cozy and so nice I decide honestly love how it turned out I feel like we had a vision of what we wanted it to look like and I feel like it even just exceeded now it's felt like home since the day we completely try to be homey so we love it through and through you have just nailed that farmhouse vibe right down to freshly baked totally you know like I just like I said before the whole farmhouse vibe just automatically feels cozy and cometa so we were trying to implement like the hutch you always see an old hutch in the farmhouses and you know having things like the galvanized playing and you know the dishes and everything yeah I think the farmhouse is that place where you come home for a nice home-cooked meal and somewhere where it's not extravagant but it's homey and beautiful in its own right and that's kind of what I think em was a really good job of of capturing on here she certainly has and you're immediately greeted by this wonderful definitely carries through that very homey feel yeah that was one of the things so there's a list that what Joel and I drew up for the things that we wanted to have in a tiny house as a family of four so one of them was a big enough kitchen so that the girls could actually come and come up and feel like they had to get out of my space when I'm in the kitchen and then another one was having a decent-sized table that we could pull out so that we still have family meals because I don't want us to you know live small and not forget why we did this enough yeah exactly yeah which is really the quality time having time with family and not having so much stuff and things to do but focusing on our girls and then a kitchen that looks like it is just begging to be cooked complete with the bread box right right and you can tell we are parents of young children so we have two different medical coffeemaker Lenti of happy thank you [Music] ideally we are gonna extend this countertop out so that we can put barstools for the girls but right now as it is yes we have the biggest fridge that we could fit in a tiny house but honestly that was I think another one on the list is we needed to have we're a family of four we have a lot of groceries the girls eat infinite amount of snack so we needed to have a bigger fridge for that bigger fridge and a full-size range for the cooking and a big sink because we end up with a lot of dishes of course as well right building a tiny house for a family is a totally different ballgame you have to consider so many different aspects you know the children washing their hands and you know spilling over whereas when you are just designing it for maybe a single person or a couple you don't have to consider as many variables like we could have done other much smaller fridge Oh completely you know things like that and but you know this dis gives us leave them with the communes of a bigger home a bigger kitchen actually feels very big to us honestly as a family for there's like endless dishes and laundry and you know I have to I have to keep on top of those things I think so having the double sinks perfect no no in this part of the house as well the sense of space is quite grand and I think that's because you've got this wonderful vaulted ceiling in here just adding slowly yeah and that was something that we had to decide as you'll see later on we've got the girls have each got their own sleeping space about their own lofts and initially we thought well we were weakened ously we need our own loft as well and we initially had planned it but it'll often here but as we started to look into it more in a 3d diagrams of it it just really felt that closing it quite a bit we're gonna feel yeah I made it feel quite a bit smaller but now as you walk in as you can see I mean you're quite a tall guy and it still feels it's a good amount of space so without including a sleeping loft for both of you where do you sleep that's that is the number one question we get asked by family and friends so initially we were gonna have a bedroom upstairs but we decided to do the pull-out couch which is totally romantic but and it's incredibly comfortable actually yes completely gotten used to it and it's a good size and we love it I am so surprised by how romantic how cozy it is and how private it feels even though we have the girls lofts just right up that stairs I mean life with toddlers is never very private anyway they wanna yeah wherever you are but to us no it feels like our space when the girls are in bed they're in bed early enough and we've got our own space down here and we love it and another great advantage of doing it that way is you have this phenomenal sized family couch now definitely so this was another one on the list that we absolutely wanted to have as a family we wanted a big enough couch to have a good size bed for us but we also wanted the couch to function as you know a big couch for all of our families found before they all fit on here and exactly so we read books on here you know the girls do their little doodling and Joel and I are right here with them so it just feels like a good almost like a conventional living space you'd have in a normal house and talked to me about the storage in here yeah so there was a lot of options for us when having the house built and what kind of storage options we wanted there was a few that were for us quite obvious the staircase is the perfect scenario I mean it's wakes in space otherwise but we weren't quite sure how the living situations would really work until we were fully into it so we thought a lot of that we've been adding on later on for example these cupboards here and there actors are this is my side the clothing storage and we've each got our own size yeah Emma signs over here we've got things for the kids over here we've got toys and games everything for them it all works up perfectly and they just love it we've also got these cupboards shelves in here we've got baskets for their paints and their play-doh and everything and they can just go up and grab a basket put it on the table and away they go and it works obviously perfectly and then I notice you've got a hook here sticking out of the ceiling what's that doing there we do so this is one of the girls favorite things about this space right here is we actually have a swing that hooks up for the girls the seat is wide enough for both of them to sit on and read books and they actually can get quite a height in this way that was one of the things that I remember seeing in a tiny house year years ago not the exact sowing that we have but I remember seeing how fun it looked for the kids and just to something a little fun for them and then through there is the bathroom so right over here we have the pocket door and obviously it provides a lot of privacy for us it just slides in really easily and then it looks like you've managed to fit in a great sized bathroom yeah so we were able to design a space that was perfect for not only us as a couple but also for our girls so the big washer dryer is totally essential for a family of four we're constantly doing laundry and the other thing was a full-size tub is was totally necessary we do the the kids have a bath every night almost and for us it was just the two of us we may not have needed it but I figured it was pretty essential for the kids of a full-size tub and it fits in here perfectly it doesn't even feel to ground or anything yeah I think another good thing about this washroom is the amount of storage space so we have like a good size sink and vanity where we can store all the toothbrushes we have all this organization on the side where Joel is and obviously good hanging for towels in and I say you've got the composting toilet here yeah we're kind of partially off-grid and partially on grid but we are not on any septic field or anything so we've got the composting toilet because it just makes things so convenient with where we are we didn't have to design a septic field or anything which is very costly of course and much more of a permanent thing and this has worked out very well for us we'd never even even heard of it before we designed the tiny house I had that built and we love it it's been great fantastic and then upstairs we've got the kids bedrooms we do which is actually my favorite part of the house let's go let's check it out so obviously one of my favorite spaces is the lofts but this little Reading area I just absolutely love how the kids can just run up there grab a book and then either go up into their loft or come back down to the couch area yeah there may be a little about their total bookworms that's that's one thing we didn't really sacrifice in a tiny house is we wanted to keep all of their books so we had to kind of fit some in the stairs some in this little storage and then correct is there you did make me sacrifice my books what I love about what you've done here as well as it creates this really special little zone where you know that you're about to enter the child space exactly yeah so we were trying to figure out do we get hanging storage that was one of the things that we're kind of lacking or do we make it that as soon as you go up the staircase you're kind of entering the kids oh yeah yeah and can we take a look at the rooms up this of course you can come on up thank you this is absolutely so this is one of the coziest spaces I think in the whole house and we actually even though the ceilings are lower it is a place that we spend a lot of time in so the girls and I and Joel we we always take turns reading books up here and we wanted Isla to have a really big mattress and a big bed so that we could actually all fit up here together that's so nice lots of storage building up here as well yeah there's tons of storage we actually have four wicker baskets so two of them are for toy storage and then two of them are for the clothes so the only kind of hanging storage that we have is the little hook that you see when you're going up the stairs and then the rest is just folding so the girls don't need a lot of clothes they just need the staple outfits that they wear you know throughout the week so they have them in two baskets right there and then we have IVs room over the other side we do can we take a look at that well of course this is just so sweet I can't believe they eventually managed to fit a crib up in here we have so one of the big things was our little list is still in a crib and she's probably gonna be in a crib for another year as we absolutely had to fit a crib in the space eventually I think we're gonna convert it into a swinging door because right now we're kind of lifting her up and kind of swooping her into the space but for right now she thinks it's Birk hosing she loves it great and that's cool that you have managed to put some doors and up here as well yeah so this was something that was a kind of a central element of the nursery that we wanted is because our little one is still waking up at night and we didn't want that sound to travel over to our older daughter who pretty much sleeps pretty soundly so we did a bifold door on here which is just super easy it eyelashes and unlatches and the sound travel is at a minimum fantastic and this is a nursing chair that I'm sitting on right now isn't it and you know why you fit perfectly in that chair consider moving in here no problem no problem at all we'll just shift this one over there you can hear perfectly great so you've been living in the tiny house now for six weeks how are you adapting to family life living tiny I think it's been surprisingly quick actually we thought it would take quite a bit longer but it was the first night in the kids room this is home and they thought it was just the coolest thing ever and they still love it our oldest selves all the time how much she loves our tiny house and she corrects me if I call it a small a small house or mini house no no no no and to her she's she just takes so much pride in her loft in her area and which is so happy because I feel like we've made a really good choice for a family absolutely so I think this home signifies a slower pace of life ever since we had the girls it was like okay you got a go go go you know we did a renovation on a house and then we built a house and then we bought this acreage and it just seems like we were a family that we love doing things but not necessarily the best when you have young children you need to be present and you to take the time to focus on just the memories I think in the simplicity of it it's so much more simple yeah we have all these little notes like love grows best in tiny houses and the front mat is that too and it may seem a little cheesy you and you're talking about it or or not authentic but it truly is is I find like when we were in such a big home everybody kind of just went to their own spaces and you kind of were calling to see where the girls were and and whatnot but just being able to communicate and everybody's still having their own spaces but being together as a family so this has brought us together simplified life so I think that it will it won't just end it will always be a part of our lives and what was your budget for building this tiny house so in the end all in it costs 119 thousand dollars Canadian dollars after tax but that included things like the nature's head toilet the gray water filtration all appliances delivery setup and business and taxes so before that it was one hundred and six thousand four times well I really can say why you've both just absolutely fallen in love with this one it is such a beautiful space that you've created for your family thank you so much for sharing it with so much for coming thanks for coming grace the design of this tiny house really is so lovely Jolin immerse it out to create a wonderful farmhouse style tiny house for their family and that is exactly what they've done even better than that though they've created a space that really brings their family together which teaches them lessons about what's really important in life and there is no greater gift that you can give your children than that [Music] you", "3-sc4rlV93g": "tell you what it's a little bit worrying when you get something in the mail and it looks like this good a guy's trust me to pick a day where there's no Sun to do a video about solar panels so this morning I woke up it was beautiful blue skies I have no idea what's happened but anyway let's talk about solar panels so this was the first solar panel that I got I've had a couple over the years so this is a projector unit it's a foldable solar panel ad what cost me 400 bucks at the time and that's done really really well it's cool because you know you can set that up in the Sun you can have your car in the shade which is always a bonus then I went on to this one here so this is 130 watt solar panel it's just a cheap one I think it cost me a hundred and seventy bucks at the time so I had this permanently mounted to my last car for about a couple of years and that went pretty well as well so the time came to figure out what I was gonna do with project sign as far as solar goes so I decided to go for semi-flexible solar panels so this one here is from i-tech world in Burswood so what I decided to do is to go for a 100 watt but two of them and I was just about to buy them when I was like you know what what if I get a expensive one and a cheap one just so I can compare them so this one here cost me three hundred dollars delivered there so nice and light when you compared into these ones here so that one there should be a hundred watt panel let me just double check that I wish I could learn to read well that sucks because it actually doesn't say anything about how many watts or how many amps it actually produces so we're just assumed that that's 100 watt panel for the moment because I don't really know what it is so that one cost me $300 from i-tech world and Burswood and then this one here 99 bucks delivered from Sonia and I got to say so far the winner is sunny because the packaging is actually quite solid so good job there guys today Oh mate there's even suction cups look at that alright so then we got that panel there from Sun Yee so I'm very curious to see how these will compare so I'm just gonna have a quick look at them myself because it's the first time I've ever seen them I just have a look see what the differences are and go from there so I just wanted to point out this is the fixed solar panel that I had for a couple of years so like I said this panel didn't cost me very much but you can really tell that it's not the best quality panel so there's marks here and they're definitely not on the outside so they're actually inside the panel and you can see there's like lines across there I'm not really sure if the camera's gonna pick it up but all through here you can just see lines there and you can just tell by looking at the panel that it's not the best panel on the market by far this is a pain in the butt to unwrap the general saying goes with this kind of stuff it all comes out of the same factory well when you look at these through solar panels I'll definitely say they haven't come out of the same factory this one here's got a very reflective surface on it here this one's got a very matte surface across it this one's got the little lines the expect to see in the solar cells this one hasn't got any of that the sizes are a little bit different this one's a bit longer so I'm very curious to see how these two panels perform against each other so this solar panel here this is a sunny $99 solar panel this one's actually got the maximum power current which is actually how many amps you're gonna be able to possibly get out of the panel so that's five point six eight now I'll just show you the other panel quickly so this is the three hundred dollar I check well with solar panel and when I look at the specs is actually nothing about how many amps or how many watts it actually puts out which is a little bit disappointing because you generally expect to see that on a back of a panel so I have no idea what's going on there it's very weird so they use a semi flexible solar panel so you may be wondering what's the flexibility actually like well that's panel here is a very very flexible I mean you look at that how cool is that that's some pretty good flex the Sun ye $99 solar panel it gets really tight there so just had some cracking this I don't know if this has that got that much flexibility it doesn't look like it's damaged ooh it's definitely not as flexible as a 300 dollar solar panel so solar panels like this generally come with PV connectors well there's nothing wrong with these really they just they're just yeah just don't like them virtually that that's all it comes down to so I'm not gonna use them so if you just give me a minute guys I'll just rewire these in to my Anderson plugs actually I'll just quickly show you guys what I've figured out my Enderson plugs because I wanted to be able to connect both panels at once I'll just show you quickly so on top of the car this is the solar input on the roof rack for the solar panels this is what they're gonna hit get hooked up to and I was trying to figure out a way that I could have either one solar panel two solar panels but I still wanted to be able to have the option of only having one or having both so I figured out if I make a double adapter at the end of the solar panel lead I can actually hook that in there say if I just want to run this solar panel I can hook that in like that if I want to run both well I got a do just click that in like that and that way both solar panels are hooked up then if I just want to run this one you know you plug that in like normal so that was the solution I came up with so hopefully it works out I guess we'll see howdy guys just give me a minute to make up the new ends for the solar panels and then hopefully the Sun will come out some tongs so we can actually test the things tell you what you never do a good soda unless you forget to put the heat shrink on guarantee every time you forget to put the heat shrink on your solar job is just gonna be mint the rain is seriously not playing ball today so the rains finally cleared up don't know what's going on with the weather this year it's all over the shop I've got the Anderson plugs on both of the solar panels so they're ready to roll so as soon as we get a blue patch of sky I'll chuck them up on the roof and we can test them out but I might just quickly tell you guys why should decided to go with the semi-flexible solar panels well pretty much one of the reasons is the weight the only way they weigh under two kilograms each which is really light weight and the other reason is I didn't want to have a permanent setup so with these I can virtually with the roof rack I've got I can pretty much cable tie them anywhere I want so if I'm going away for a month up north I'll probably have my second spare tire up here my Mac shacks some other bits and bobs I can virtually put the panel's wherever they fit otherwise sound a couple of weeks I'm going sea kayaking down south I'll have my sea kayak that'll take up one whole side of the car now if you had firmly mounted roof right I mean solar panels chances are the sea kayak will be blocking them and you're not going to get as much output well with these I can have one panel here cable tie the other panel there and my match takes up the back and everything will be in the Sun and everything will work so that's pretty much why my setup changes a lot so this way nothing's permanent and I if I only want to run one panel I can just run one panel I don't have to always have to so that's pretty much why just a flexibility aspect of it you get it flexibility aspect today is just not working out with getting the constant sunshine I need to do a test like this so let's jump forward to a day where there is constant sunshine all righty well we got beautiful blue skies today I'm at a beautiful location this is broken let it's been closed for two years and finally just got reopened a couple of weeks ago the Rangers just said so that's awesome so I can finally test out these solar panels because we got the weather we want so I just run you through how I'm thinking about doing this test so on the roof both of the panels are mounted on the same flat surface pretty much they're both in the full sunshine I've got two cables coming down from them so the one with this little pull thingy on it is the $99 sunny and this one is the $300 a tech old panel how am I going to actually do this test well I have a battery monitor which can monitor how many amps are going in and out of the batteries and I'll just quickly show you what our voltage and that kind of thing is looking like right now so just to run you through the voltages all right we're at twelve point seven eight volts we've got zero amps coming in and out zero what's coming in and out and last night he is 27.4 and powers and the battery is at 91% so what that means is the battery needs a charge so pretty much the DC to DC charger should be stuff in as much power as it can possibly get out of the panel's pretty much and also as far as the solar panels go on the roof they've both been in the Sun for the same amount of time and also I gave them both a clean this morning so they should be performing as well as each other so let's go ahead and plug in the $99 sunny panel and see what it does it's gonna take a couple of minutes for the DC to DC charge and realize hey there's solar coming in let's use it but we'll get there all righty we've got a reading Wow that's awesome so at the moment the $99 sunny panel is putting in six point three amps six point one nine six point three that's awesome that's absolutely kickin it a that's very cool so we know what that's putting in so let's check it on the other one and see what that does all right so just unplugged it and plug the other one in I just live for a little bit longer to see if it settles but at the moment we're putting in four point seven amps that's a massive difference I just double check to make sure I've plugged in the right one to the right one but that's definitely the itec world panel at the moment so four point seven let's plug in the Sun here again I can't believe this there we go six point two amps it's got up to the same voltage all over again I'm just gonna double check I have a plug in the right panel of the right cord again cuz I'm just gobsmacked legit six point two ants alright I'm gonna do it again so the three hundred dollar I tickled pan Oh is actually giving me four point seven amps well the 1900 dollar sunny panel plugged in identically is giving me six point two amps that's the difference of one-and-a-half amps which when you think about it adds up pretty fast so I'm using the same length of cable from each panel they're both 5 meter extension leads that I've been plugging them into and it I just can't get my head around it like that's just nuts I have left it on a little bit longer and it has gone a 4.96 so pretty much five amps so that's still a difference of one point two amps but to mix up this test even more when you get cheap solar panels you're pretty much most of the time get a really really cheap solar regulator doesn't make that much difference well I'm gonna plug this in and see what the difference is I'm really curious to see what this is going to put out as opposed to a really good MPPT decent a DC charger so let's do it just to explain what's going on under here with the cheap solar regulator I've got three Anderson plugs here one hooks up to the solar the others just straight to the battery so for the test with a cheap regulator it just goes directly to the battery and to the panel so that's all it is alright so I've plugged in the let me just check the I tech world $300 solar panel at the moment I think the solar regulators going to take a little while to kick in just like the other time all right so at the moment we've got the eye tech world solar panel plugged in and that's putting in 5.1 amps through the cheap eBay style solar regulator that you'd normally get which is pretty impressive so let's check on the $99 sunny panel and see how that goes Wow there you go so it's just stabilized and at the moment we're sitting on six amps that's just a crazy difference so even with the cheap regulator the Sonia panel is still performing so much better than the other panel I am literally mind blown I just want to talk about a B and C glass panels quickly so when I boarded that sunny panel I was a bit skeptical because it said it was an a-class panel but after using it I'd say it's definitely an a-class panel because it's working awesome so what's a big glass panel well a beef glass panel is one where there's obvious imperfections and a glass panel is perfect has no imperfections in it and then a c-class panel is one where there's imperfections in it and it doesn't perform because and technically an A and a B Class panel should work just as well as each other even there are imperfections does it really matter whether you get a B or C well you don't want a cPanel in fact I've never even seen a cPanel advertised but a or B doesn't really matter as long as they work they give you the output that they say they do who really cares all righty let's crunch some numbers so with the MPPT DC to DC charge are looking after the solar the I tech world put in four point seven one amps the sunny panel put in a weave Oh crazy one point sorry six point one nine amps that means a difference of one point to two amps that is massive so then I hooked up the cheapo eBay kind of regulator that you'd buy expecting the results to be completely different by the itec Worldpanel put in five point one amps and sunny panel put in five point nine seven amps so that's a difference of point eight one of an amp I am absolutely blown away by these results the coolest thing about doing a test like this is you don't actually know what there is also going to be until you to this stage right here the end of the video so in both cases the sunny panel absolutely trumped the are tech world panel just unbelievably even with the cheap regulator I was quite surprised how well that did so you may be wondering should I just get a cheap regulator cheap panel I'll be sorted yes or no the thing is MPPT charger or a DC to DC charger that solar ready is going to maintain your batteries a lot better because it goes through the different stages of charging PWM regulators which is normally where you get with cheap panels are pretty much an on/off switch they're not going to maintain it as well that being said if you are a bit strapped for cash just you know it's gonna it's gonna get your voltage up which is exactly what you want so if you can treat panels seem to be the way to go and then go for a decent MPPT charger and you're actually absolutely I cranked the voltage so it is interesting that it did do a little bit better the MPPT then the PWM charger but I just can't believe these results hey like I absolutely got ripped off with that I take old pad Oh anyway I'm gonna guess are in my misery but I'll see you guys in another video I", "Qs2s7kxZvgQ": "", "LvGXer4NsEw": "years ago now I started building my very own tiny house on wheels that project is finally finished and today I'd like to show you around [Music] so welcome to my tiny house on wheels we've only recently completed the build of this tiny house and it's just been moved on to this new property where I'm paying a little bit of rent every month to park it here in the driveway so all of the landscaping and everything that I've done around it is absolutely brand-new designing the tiny house to be really mobile I think has been a really good idea and I'm glad that I made it a little bit smaller so that it's easier to transport on the roads we don't own land yet we are in the process of saving up for our own plot of land so being able to save on rent by owning our own home and being able to channel that money instead into saving up for land I think is a really good idea the home is roughly 15 square metres and it's all completely off the grid on the roof I have a 1.2 kilowatt solar system which is charging a 240 amp hour battery bank at 24 volt as you can see we're also collecting rainwater here all of the rainwater is collected by the spouting that comes down into this tank here which is a stainless steel tank which is collecting about 200 litres of water now 200 litres is not a lot of water so we will have to be very conscious of water usage whether in this home but I'm hoping that it's going to be enough to get by in the worst-case scenario I do also have the ability to both plug into mains power to help charge the batteries as well as plug in a water hose so I can also use mains water in the house if I need to aside from the off-grid features one of my absolute favorite features about the exterior of the home is my outdoor shower we live quite close to the beach here so there is nothing like being able to go for a surf or go for a swim come home and get all of the sand off before you jump in your house in the future we're going to be doing another video where I can talk in more detail about the off-grid systems and the way that the house was constructed but this time around just because the house is brand new I'm really excited to show you so let's get inside and check it out follow me  so here we are I am so excited that this house is now complete I've waited for this for such a long time and it really is a dream come true to have it all completed now as you can see we're only just starting to set things up and move things into the house so it is all completely new first of all coming into the house we're right in the kitchen now the kitchen was designed to be very simple and very utilitarian one of the first things that I really loved about the kitchen is the high bench top we've actually built the bench top to a meter as you know I am not the shortest person ever to have lived in a tiny house and so being able to raise up the countertops has been a really nice way of making the house fit me a little bit better I did make a deal with Russa that if she ever wanted me to do the dishes then I had to have a higher bench top otherwise it was all on her so that was how I managed to give that compromise into the house one of my pet peeves in any kitchen is when it has a really small sink I think it's really important to be able to have a sink where you can put things away get them out of sight or where you can comfortably wash your dishes so with this house I decided to have a really big sink there are actually three sinks in here and two of them are covered most of the time with these chopping boards which have actually been routed out of the bench top what that does is it gives us lots of prep area but also the ability to lift these out and wash up when we need to the bench top here is 600 deep which is pretty conventional for a kitchen here in New Zealand that gives us really nice deep drawers forage so we've got lots of storage space in this kitchen one of the things that we did compromise on in size a little bit is the fridge so we only have an 80 litre fridge in here which does mean that we potentially need to do a little bit more frequent shopping but that's really no problem we have shops that are two minutes down the road and I quite like having fresh produce plus one day I want to be growing it all on my garden anyway so I figured don't worry about the big fridge just go for something that's enough so one of the things that you'll probably notice about this kitchen is there is no built-in cooktop the for their being because it's an off-the-grid home sometimes I'm going to be generating a lot of power and I'll be able to use an induction cooktop and other times I might have to resort to a gas hob or something else so I wanted to build flexibility into the home plus I really like barbecuing anyway so whenever I can I think it's actually nice to get cooking outside of a tiny house because cooking odors and small spaces really can build up so unless you go absolutely crazy on fan's in your tiny house I love whenever possible cooking outside that being said we do have really great ventilation in this home within this home one of my real priorities and the design was insulation I wanted to make sure that this house was always going to be nice and warm in the winter and nice and cool in the summer so all of the windows are made from thermally broken aluminum which means they have a little strip of plastic that breaks up the aluminium meaning they don't thermally conducting side they're all double glazed and give a really nice warmth to the home and that's been paired with polyester insulation and the walls which gives us a really nice r-value in the home and keeps everything toasty adding to keeping everything toasty in the home is our little wood stove this is the Sparky wood stove which is actually a 10 kilowatt wood stove which for the size of this space is potentially a little bit ridiculous it will cook us out of this in the winter but what I really like about this model is that unlike a lot of other small wood stoves it does have fire bricks in it it's got a little bit of thermal mass so it means that when you light the fire and let the fire go out it will continue to radiate heat throughout the night which i think is a really nice feature now moving over here we have our stairwell so the stairs the kitchen and all of the beautiful built-in furniture in this house was done by friends of Al's Jake and Casey from varient spaces they have a little business which is specializing in designing custom cabinetry for small homes and they are doing a phenomenal job and I just am so thrilled with what they've done for us in this house especially this very intricate staircase so as you can see this is our loft access it's built to be able to comfortably access the loft but also is shaped in a really great way which doesn't enclose off the space in any way there is a tremendous amount of storage so all of these drawers open up we've even got hanging clothes storage in here and if you take a look in this cupboard we've even got all of our off the grid system so we have our fuse box our inverter our solar controller and our 12 volt transformer so everything has nice easy access before I move further into the home I have to talk about some of the artistic elements that our builder Brinton has put into this home one of my favorite aspects of this home is the power inlays Brinton like me is a little bit of a geek when it comes to sacred geometry I call this house the seed of life because I love the seed of life in terms of geometric proportions and design but also for me it's a little bit symbolic because this tiny house and this project really was the seed of my life this gave birth to a whole new life for me which i think is really beautiful and to celebrate that brington has gifted me this panel where he has created the seed of life pattern in power inlay we call it power here in new zealand i believe in north america this is known as abalone but it's just such a gorgeous aspect and it has this wonderful iridescent shimmer that just catches the eye over here we have our couch area the couch is a really comfortable space it's not too big but not too small it's just enough to be able to comfortably read a book or sit down and maybe watch a movie built enter this again as lots of storage so as you can see both russer and I do have drawers and here where we can pack away clothes and other things the top of this also lifts up to provide more storage over the other side is the office the office again is a very important area for us we do work from home we spend a lot of time when we are in the country sitting here editing videos so it's really important for us to be able to have a nice working area I do love my books as well so being able to have a bookcase was another really essential element in this home in pride of place here on the bookshelf right now you may notice the living big in a tiny house book this is something that I haven't talked about a lot on the channel yet because it hasn't come out yet internationally right now this book is only available in New Zealand but be sure to look out because soon it is coming to the rest of the world again we have lots of storage in the office we really have put little storage nuts into each and every place that we could in this tiny house including even these little squares here which cover the wheel well which lift off and give us little areas for more storage I think I'll probably put computer cables or things like that and those included in the storage is this here this again would beautiful seed of life power inlay is our chair when we're sitting at the desk it also allows us to easily access our storage loft above the kitchen which right now is completely empty and when we're sitting here at the bench it also doubles as a table so it can lift up and we could either bring the laptop over here or when we're sitting back move it over here and it can wrist a glass of wine and then we have the bathroom the bathroom I think is pretty luxurious as far as tiny house bathrooms go we've got our really nice low-flow showerheads including a rainfall showerhead this has all been designed custom to fit into the space I wanted to have a decent sized shower but the square boxes just really weren't working and fitting in with the unusual shape of this room so by custom building the shower we were able to nicely fit everything in and get it all looking harmonious the bathrooms pretty simple we have the shower we have a vanity the vanity mirror I think is a really nice element in the home I think it's important to have a mirror with really nice lighting so that I can shave also that russa can do her makeup so this has again been custom done with the seat of life pattern in it and if I turn it on you can see it has a really nice light coming from it the basin and here is really lovely and this was a custom-made basin by our friends Jake and kasya which is a real treasure in the tiny house I don't yet have a composting toilet installed in this tiny house but that will be coming in the future one of the kind of quirky things that we did in this tiny is we put toilet brush holders on the wall I've actually used them as plant holders in essence with a composting toilet you don't need a toilet brush so this has been a really cool kind of funky element and I would love to get more plants in here in the future unfortunately right now it's really difficult for us to keep house plants because we're not really home or even in New Zealand long enough to keep them alive but we do have a few which can be babysat by my friends or parents so that's okay but one day I will have more now the bathroom door again this is very beautiful and on the inside it has a full-length mirror which i think is a really nice feature that about wraps it up for the bathroom so let's take a look at the sleeping loft but before we do that this here is a real treasure and something that I had to give pride of place in the tiny house this is our gold play button which we received for passing 1 million subscribers on YouTube 1 million is just such a crazy number it is incredible that we're now fast approaching 2 million subscribers and I really can't say how much this has completely changed my life it's changed Russ's life when I started building this tiny house I was an unemployed actor I had recently been killed off of the television show and I was struggling to make life work in a city that was really expensive I wanted to be able to keep doing a job that I loved but that I wasn't always getting paid for and I was definitely struggling and that was why I built this tiny house on wheels I saw this as a way that I could simplify my life minimize my expenses and have a small simple shelter that was enough so that in here I didn't have to worry about mortgage I didn't have to worry about rent and where I would be able to continue doing a job that I loved I looked around and I saw so many others who were in my situation and that was why I actually started the YouTube channel originally I wanted to share this thing that I had become so excited about wanted to share the concepts of alternative living with people so that they realized there were other options out there and I never dreamed back then that building this home would have been the start of all of this and I just can't express how grateful I am for that anyway let's go check out the sleeping loft come on up the steps here are designed to be really comfortable to come up and down as you can see the last step is double height which makes it very easy to come into the sleeping loft kneeling and because we've got the gable roof here I've also designed it to have this 45 degree angle coming off the loft which allows us to come in to where your head height is the highest so being able to make the axis this way makes it a lot more comfortable so this is the sleeping loft again there's not a tremendous amount of space up here it really is just for sleeping but this is also one of my absolute favorite places inside the home and that is because of the two roof windows here there is nothing like being able to lie in bed and look at the stars at night so this was one thing that I always have wanted to do so both russer and I have our very own skylight so we get a great view of the sky at night you'll notice in the home that we have no blinds no curtains yet those are definitely still to come because while it's maybe not such a big deal if we were parked up in a beautiful remote property right now when we are in the middle of the suburbs we're feeling pretty exposed so we're definitely going to get curtains in here so let's talk cost of this tiny house this home was not cheap we're in New Zealand which means we pay a lot more than other countries for both materials and labor and all throughout the home I've worked with high quality materials and really talented craftsmen so that has come at a little bit of a premium it's completely off the grid and so I've had to pay a little bit more for my electrical appliances as well as even just things like the wiring and the house and all of that sort of thing so all up right now my home has cost me around $100,000 mark now that's New Zealand Dollars that being said I'm in a city where the average house price right now is 1 million dollars so my home is roughly 1/10 the value of an average home in this city so for me this makes complete financial sense and although it's been somewhat of a painful process chipping away at the build bit by bit over the last few years by doing it that way it has meant that I haven't had to pay one big chunk all up front so I have been able to pay it off as I go which is fantastic because it now means that I do own this home without any debt so I hope that you have enjoyed this first tour of the home we're definitely going to be making more videos in here later showing you more of the features and giving more in-depth information right now this evening we are about to jump on a plane we are heading back to North America to continue filming for the show so this year there is going to be lots more content coming from around the world and in the summer when we're back here in New Zealand we'll be making more videos here so until then I'll see you next week [Music]", "HjJGjlpMfv0": "", "iAgVxSXgAGw": "A tidy home really makes such a difference to a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense of well-being. However, organizing your home does not have to be an expensive interior decoration project because all you need is a little out-of-the-box thinking and just a little bit of elbow grease. Welcome to Jansen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DIY and here are 50 Brilliant Storage Ideas to Put Your Home in Order. #1. You can get some stackable wine racks and inexpensive plastic cups to organize your office or even craft supplies. By using a stackable wine rack, you save a lot of space and your supplies such as markers, pens, paintbrushes, pins, etc. are within easy reach. #2. Are you a fan of craft projects and have tons of scrap paper that you use? File all your scrap or scrapbook paper in file folders, so that you can reuse them or create a new crafts project. By sorting out your scrapbook paper, you end up saving paper, space and money. #3. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t throw out your old wire hangers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 instead convert them into ribbon and tape holders. Take a pair of wire cutters and cut one end of the wire hanger. Use a pair of pliers to make hoops out of the cut ends and now you can store all your ribbons and tape easily. #4. Power strips are a necessary evil in all homes nowadays, considering the number of electrical devices we use. However, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be in plain sight at all. Take a wire basket and hang it under your desk and put your power strips there. Not only are they out of sight, but it becomes more convenient those short charging cords that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite reach the floor. #5. If you like to use ribbons and pile them up in a storage box then spend hours trying to sort through them to find the one you want, then you can use a simple paper towel holder to organize all your ribbon spools. When they are neatly organized, you can easily find them instead of rifling through a messy drawer to look for them. #6. Organizing Tupperware lids can be a real pain. However, a really simple solution is to take a metal CD rack and place it sideways. Then, you can place your Tupperware lids in an upright position. If you arrange them size-wise, with the largest lids at the back, you will never have a problem finding the smaller lids again. #7. If you have basic sewing skills, then this is a brilliant way to organize your Tupperware lids. All you need is a piece of cloth which you can sew several large pockets. Tack this lid holder onto the side of your cupboard door to save even more space. #8. When we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re short on cupboard space, we tend to stack our plates. However, now, rather than stacking your plates, you can invest in some plate cradles. This way, you can store your plates in an upright position, which would make it easier for you to take them out of your cupboard. #9. Instead of throwing away your food containers such as creamer bottles, recycle them. You can store your sugar, nuts, chocolate chips and small snacks. You can even use some of these containers as water bottles. #10. If you have a small space either in your kitchen or your bathroom, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use a towel bar. Instead, get yourself some of those door handles with large loops. Mount them on the wall or wherever you need them, and you have an interesting towel hook. #11. Shoe organizers can be used for almost any kind of storage. If you are looking for under-sink storage, then all you need to do is buy a small shoe organizer or cut the one you have in half. #12. Most of us stack our bakeware and pans one on top of the other. Instead, get a bakeware organizer and attach it to your cupboard on its side. Your pans and bakeware will now be neatly organized and easily accessible. #13. Drawer dividers can be expensive. Instead use things you may have lying around your house to create drawer dividers. You can use things like egg cartons, a shoebox lid or even silicone muffin holders for this project. #14. Storing the lids of pots and pans can be messy and untidy. Instead, install towel bars on your kitchen pantry door and store your lids easily. The metal towel bars look the best, but you can even buy the cheaper plastic ones if you like. #15. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have shelf space or drawer space in your kitchen or pantry, then all you need to do is use push pins and tack your plastic wrap boxes to your pantry wall. Instant storage! #16. If you use spices in your cooking, but you have a small kitchen, then you might want to invest in some spice racks. You will save a lot of shelf space this way and organize your spices. Buy these nifty and inexpensive spice storage racks and mount them on your kitchen wall or inside your kitchen cupboards. #17. Cupboards usually have height, which means you end up stacking all your kitchen supplies. This makes it difficult to take out stuff when you need it. Instead, invest in some cheap magazine holders. You can store your kitchen supplies in an upright position, there by utilizing your cupboard space more efficiently and accessing your supplies more easily. #18. If you have a lot of cosmetics and accessories, which are usually piled up in one place, then you can try this ideas. Attach command hooks to the door of your bathroom cabinet and hang small baskets from them. This way you can store your small hair accessories and make-up neatly. #19. Instead of cluttering your bathroom counter with your hairdryer, create a storage space for these appliances using a file box. You can attach it to either the wall or the side of your counter. #20. You can stick a magnetic strip to the door or drawer of your bathroom cabinet and then use it hold all your metal accessories such as hair clips, nail files, tweezers, etc. #21.

Put the hooks at the frame. The caps on the ends of the rods keep the rods in place. Insert a roll of gift wrap over a rod and place into the cup hooks. Insert the gift wrap into the rod and it's done... #31. Christmas lights are a nightmare to store away properly since they get so tangled up when you roll them up.

They are really handy to have around the house. You can repurpose them and use them to store things like markers, stickers and even your baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crayons. #47. An ironing board can be a pain to store, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bulky and it tends to get in the way. You can create a wall mounted storage option behind the laundry room door or your walk-in closet. All you need are some robe hooks mounted on the wall, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all set. #48. If you have a garden mailbox and want to get rid of it, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t! Instead, convert it into a mini toolshed. You can place it in your garden as an accent piece (grow some vines around it or place it in a flowerbed) and use it to store your small garden tools. #49. This rack is available in the market, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re handy with tools, then you can make one yourself with PVC pipes. They are great for drying your wet clothes in the sun without having to put up a clothesline. And they are easy to move. #50.

You can also use them to store those plastic bags that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning to recycle. So\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what do you thinks about this episodes? Please share your thoughts about this video in the comment section\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Thanks for watching and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see you in the next video\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "7sLQ-2rCdmw": "so this was our graph so the house that sits behind it is a three-bedroom two-bath and the city told us that it was actually legal to live in your garage as long as you permitted it the right way in Portland is actually called an ad you an accessory dwelling unit so every lot in Portland every residential lot can have a secondary dwelling unit usually in a garage sometimes in a just a separate build out back but it's all legal and when we walked in they set an ad you actually if you do it as an ad you it'll actually be free and we're like ooh freeze the perfect number for us right now  we we actually ran away and didn't we didn't want to have God we drove south in our old Volkswagen bus for about a year and a half we had saved money for what we thought would be under a half to two years we left came back and thought it was all gonna have to end  and this is usually where we end up either working or eating breakfast just to get some nice natural light and then obviously we can pull out additional two stools and sit four to six people here or if we really have to start entertaining we can actually roll this all the way out fit six adults at the end and then have a little kids table down here on the bar I wonder if we need to so we spent years before cutting the cord and leaving downsizing moving into smaller and smaller spaces purging everything saving money no we're actually mostly living in the van out front we have a lot of morning conversations like is this where we want to be today if not why are we here let's get in the van and go and so this is what we thought would be home base and will be and we consider it that because our friends and our tribe is here but we actually spend more time living in the van and allowing other people to come in and read this which then helps fund the travels when we got back from our first trip we had purged all of our furniture and so I taught myself to weld so that instead of going and buying things we could just make a few items and so these barstools were one of the first things that I I welded up and tried selling furniture for a little while until I realized that there's really no no money there for me and then once we started creating the home it just seemed like an easy transition into the cabinetry and everything that we needed in the house  literally just giant industrial casters and some steel and so you'll notice that almost everything in here is is fairly industrial modern by nature when we got back from our trip we found a community wood shop metal shop and I taught myself to weld it just kind of moved it into the cabinetry as well so instead of going to Ikea we just built solid steel frames and then came in and found a bunch of reclaimed wood to use as the doors and the panels so literally all of this is off cuts from other people's projects at the community wood shop that we work out of we just kept saving and collecting bins and bins of wood until we thought we had enough to kind of tackle the kitchen and living room and then came in and tried to lay it up in a way that was beautiful and mesh well with the steel this is actually just two by fours that are glued up in unison and you can see all the old nail holes from what they used to be which is just studs inside of old Portland homes and so in some cases we just keep those two by fours kind of uniform and use them as they are here we tried to get as much out of a Whittle as we could and so rather than using even complete two by fours that could be used for something else we just took the scrap out of the bin when people got done cutting things off on the table saw you can see how it's just glued on the inside of this points just OSB which again cheap reclaimed you know it was budget yeah I mean at the time we we literally got back from our trip we had saved money for what we thought would be a urine after two years got back and started blowing through money renting a place and things like that and then when this project came along we just decided it was better to literally put the rest of our funds into creating a roof over our head then it was to go back and live on the road for another six months and so this was just a rickety old garage garage door dark dingy and then when we got back from our travels were in Portland for a month or two we thought it's gonna be a couple of weeks we rented a place a few blocks away realized how strange it was to be in your own neighborhood while someone else lived in your house and just kind of had an epiphany one morning that our garage was going unused so the tenants were inside but nothing was in the garage so we just started the process of trying to figure out how to convert it to a home and expected that we would just pull our bus inside when we were traveling or what have you would be very simple and then the designer in me kind of took over in Portland as they were trying to support good debt Vistal are trying to support good density and so ad use right now all the systems development charges are being waived to help kind of promote the idea and opposed to you know like our neighbors there used to be tiny bungalows sitting here and so a developer bought the bungalow tore it down in order to put up two giant homes and so for us we just tried to reuse what we already had in a different way part of the code is that we have to keep parking we never seem to use it we always just park in the street but we wanted to keep it it's just nicer for our neighbors as well as for us so we kept a little bit of parking and then tried to recapture the rest as it was a two-car so this was all driveway and then we try to just recapture the rest as landscaping yard indoor outdoor space  neighbors actually thanked us they're like thanks for beautifying this terrible corner the floor is also just OSB oriented strand board so the same thing that would typically be in a lot of houses as the subfloor and then get covered over with a hard word or something else and we had actually done this inside the house as well when we renovated many many years ago put it down weren't sure what we wanted to do with the floors and we're amazed that many years later it still looked and felt great so we just did the same thing here can always come back and refinish it with something else if we want to but so far we we love the texture and the color of it so it's it's stayed thus far [Laughter] and these countertops are who media we actually poured them in place on the floor part of the beauty of having an industrial floor this kind of an upside down form some melamine which is kind of a wood with a very slick white finish on it build that into the box the shape that you want it and then put in kind of half a layer of concrete submission to make sure it's actually strong enough and then finish off with concrete let it cure for a few days and then got a few buddies over to help lift them into place you notice we seal slightly the counter top and then left this completely dry and exposed and in my preference I love just raw concrete and would use it everywhere but as a countertop kind of nice to have a bit of a sealant or a repelling nature as things spill and it works well in a garage and it's a garage you know at some level and same as these shelves I mean these are just bent pieces of steel that we drilled out and screwed into the studs so they're absurdly strong but it's literally just a sheet of Steel I mean I can't imagine a way to make a shelf any more affordably or any more beautifully we kind of just tried to work within the box that we had and we also tried to make it match our lifestyle so we still love entertaining we love having people over so it's a bit odd in a 460 480 square foot space but a third of our living space at least is kitchen and living room oddly enough even then 480 square feet this is our perfect kitchen layout and so we literally took over a very large portion of the home to ooh so wanted the Iowan range because it's better for kind of cooking and entertaining Jen's almost a master chef and so it's nice to hang out well while people are kind of able to see and interact and sitting in the stools enough storage made a wine rack literally out of scrap steel that we just welded up into a wine rack you know these function much the same way as the taller cabinets and so everything here tends to be true kitchen and then the upper cabinets become longer-term storage and then this actually becomes more guest storage and things like that so this is where we throw the umbrellas this is where you know an extra barstool when we need it lawn chairs a bunch of things when people come in if we have somebody staying there's a nice closet that's basically just dedicated to them to put their bags and things like that oddly enough we have more storage than we need we have the same rule when we lived in a Volkswagen you know if everything can be tucked away in a cabinet where it's supposed to be then it just feels tidier and more homey last  well so this set of cabinetry is multifunctional so it's basically all of our closet clothing things like that but we also needed a way to get up to the bed and so at the time we wanted the dog to be able to join us so we actually made this set of cabinetry that's basically for linens and pillows and extra things like that can actually push away and become part of the cabinets when we're entertaining and then simply pull back out so that we can kind of bound up a few stairs to get into the bed right now it's just on glides plan was to actually put casters underneath it and put some tracks like most other things our project always seems to take a backseat to everybody else's sadly the dog is now slowing down so she joins us less often than before but a couple steps were up we're comfortable and rather than having kind of a shallow loft bed where you have to be laying down it actually still gives us a space where we can hang out comfortably and you can sit up there and read read work what have you I often do both so no we really don't and that's kind of always been one of the design factors is try and put space inside of a small house where you're actually spending your time and so it seems ridiculous that we all have a you know an 8 by 12 room that's walled off and it's only used for six to eight hours a night when you're sleeping so we try to turn that on its ear a bit and have most of the space actually functional in a place where you're gonna be hanging out and using it so underneath we basically have a couple of tools we have our laundry space I mean it's really just a utility den for us to stash the things that are unattractive obviously we try to also design this in a way that in 40 years if we still need or want to be living here we can at that point the bed will probably drop down and so it'll probably be a somewhat private bedroom underneath instead of utility space not the bathroom you probably expect in a small home in most cases but I think it's the result of two people living in a van and showering outdoors for much of a year and a half and so when we got back and started creating our perfect home we tried to mimic many of the kind of outdoor spaces that we found ourselves showering and bathing in in Mexico and Central America everything here is actually coated in a in acrylic eyes kind of waterproof concrete just to make it look like an outdoor shower that we kind of hid for a year and ass a wet room which is very very kind of European in nature I mean you don't feel out here and so when we talk to a bunch of contractors about this they thought we were crazy they had no idea and so we couldn't hire any person to do it we literally had to do each stage ourselves and then we did bring somebody in to kind of travel on this stuff because I just didn't trust myself enough to do it and we ended up going with a system that's called VD or wedi born that's actually a European system that's made exactly for this so all the panels have waterproofs themselves you put them in you patch between them with waterproof stuff and then come back and do you know I mean this is basically like stucco that you put on the outside of a house and so it's not it's not like it's a material when I used to we just don't usually bring it indoors and so construction wise it was diff usage wise it's exactly what we were after so it's light it's bright it's roomy it's kind of how we work with all small spaces is rather than coming in design homes by cutting them into the boxes but to have a bathroom that's have a living room to have a bedroom and the only walls we ever build are around a bathroom so that everything else becomes more open and so that's why you see there's you know the only two walls in here around the bathroom the other walls all get you know floor-to-ceiling built-in so that there's lots of storage and then everything else can just kind of open up for flow so the doors just stained OSB as well and we had seen these really awesome barn door rollers the various companies made and charged several hundred dollars for and the last month or two we were driving the bus in Central America we actually had blown out one of our bearings and so realized that the way that the inside of a wheel works is very much like that and so just kind of put things together and you know took a simple piece of bent metal stock wrapped it around the inside of the bearing and called it a day and so what should have been a couple hundred dollars in hardware was I think fifteen dollars it's a bit of ebb and flow but if anything this place is kind of like the hotel room that we check into when we're back in town karma so we don't have to crash on a friend's couch or in their basement although that does still happen occasionally  most of our travels happened in 267 v-dub bus which was classic and beautiful and had all the kind of warm romantic feelings that you want your vehicle to have but after that drive it started to realize that it was also starting to keep us from traveling and so the more we shopped on Craigslist the more it was really apparent we didn't have enough money to buy a vehicle but our credit union was nice enough to offer us a loan with very low interest as long as it was a new car and so we tried to get him to do it for a used car and they wouldn't and so the 4x4 Sprinter was about as good as we could find out there and we thought we'd have a really tough time emotionally parting with the bus but the the comfort and the size and the ability to to stand up like modern man rather than being a hunchback really made the transition pretty easy for us so we we actually bought it as a hollow shell we came in added the windows on the sides of the vent on the top the swivel seats and then slowly started insulating and building everything in and so unlike the bus where we pretty much had to have a couch at all times that we would then open up to a bed at night everything here pretty much stays static so if we happen to pull into a campground we can rotate the seats around so we've got better kind of seating we'll eventually put a table in here to eat by but overall things in here stay as they are because there's just enough room that everything's comfortable without us having to kind of fold up a space or rearrange it at night and we have a full full-size mattress so it's real cushy yeah I mean this is actually the same mattress that we use in our house why wouldn't we be just as comfortable into that everything is built as kind of a kit of parts that can can be unscrewed so we actually didn't drill any holes into the van that weren't there by the factory so that if we ever need to pull something back down it's easy to do so without kind of destroying the cabinetry that we put in so if we ever want to wire something up again we drop a couple panels run new sets of wires and just put everything back up where it was we tried to learn the lesson from the v-dub we rebuilt the bus twice and so instead of kind of building final right away we built everything out of a cheap OSB shell and just put in boxes that were roughly the right size drove to Vancouver spent of almost a year I guess kind of summering and enjoying the van to make sure we had what we wanted and then last fall just before a winter trip came in ripped everything out and then kind of went final with everything and so we made a few changes based upon what we learned but overall most everything stuck we tried to learn from things we learned before so this is a two burner Smith cooktop it's actually the same one that we had in the bus it's a german-engineered rig we love it and it means that we kind of have countertop that can still be used the fridge is the place that in our v-dub we kind of failed we went with the cheaper fridge that we had read about that was just used in tractor-trailer trucks and seemed to be okay but in most cases those guys are always driving and so how much they pull in terms of energy off their batteries isn't an issue and so even though we were sitting on the beaches of Baja with direct Sun on our solar panels we simply couldn't keep up with the refrigerator and so this time we went more to what we already knew to be the case which is to buy sailboat things rather than automobile things because they figured this stuff out decades ago and so we had done that with most of the things but in the fridge for whatever reason we decided to save money and so now we you know went with the marine fridge that should be in a sailboat to make sure we can stay off-grid as long as we want to stay updated spices pots and pans everything in here is again welded up metal this case it's aluminum to be lighter weight and we just prefer the aesthetic because it's a little brighter in the van and then all of the panels are bamboo we had some bamboo in the bus as well and oddly enough by the end of two years of travel and living on the beach the plywood just wasn't holding up very well it's very dirty it's rotten it was horrible as where bamboo just seemed great and bomb-proof I mean it's very resilient to water it's great to work with and it also comes in any number of different thicknesses in terms of panels and so anything from thick panels that need to kind of hold their own weight to things that'll actually allow us to bend and get the type of framework that we wanted in here you know after living in the bus for a year and a half it was very clear that if you live in a small space you will spend time bent over in agony after cramming yourself into a corner and like racking your head or shin on something sharp so we kind of bowed to not have corners anymore and so this was the result it also tends to I guess look more like an airline or a sailboat we hear a lot of that but mostly it was just a not keep hitting my head on corners in the winter this is actually cabinet storage as well in the summer we actually pull out the back panel and remove the shelves so that our surfboards can come all the way up so we can put our surfboards inside this is actually our step to get into the bed and then it also folds it's basically a small marine most boats they're actually kind of hard wet it in this is one of the models that's actually just a cassette ish toilet so this whole thing pops out it's a two layer system so the seat comes off the top and then you can simply carry the vessel at the bottom and empty it into any toilet I mean you can actually do it you know in any rest stop toilet fast food toilet or ours you know when we get back home  you know and again for us it's we're actually gonna try living in our van long-term the bed is important having a nice open space is really important to us and then we also put the the fan in top so we can actually get rid of some of the hot air which is a luxury we just never had in the bus well it seems to be great I mean the only problem we've ever had is mid winter I mean this trip we actually took a winter trip and it was negative 25 degrees it's tough I mean in that type of cold environment with two humans and a dog inside of a space you're gonna collect a lot and so the only way to do it is even though you're trying to keep heat is to keep something open and keep air movement in the vehicle to try and get rid of it so if we you know we've got place for all of our bedding we've got place for comforters and pillows and sheets and things that normally you don't have a large enough space for in a van to stuff away anywhere so they end up just kind of out and exposed at all times which it just isn't how we choose to travel and then we actually end up stealth camping 80 90 percent of the time we've got a bunch of blackout blinds that we actually just built storage for into the bed and we're in stuff woods well crooked stealth mode but stealth mode nonetheless we've led the lane but because we spend so much time trying to save money and travel kind of low-key there's often not a plan so we very rarely are in campgrounds we tend to just row into a place and then figure out last-minute where we're gonna sleep and so the nice thing is if we're getting tired on the road we literally need two seconds to kind of figure out where we're gonna Park pull everything out of the storage go into kind of stealth mode and then just call it a night we do curtain up here mostly for the winter it's insulated and it rolls downs and we have a heater so not only are we only warming at the back but also nobody even knows we're in here when you've got this tight it's pretty completely blacked out yeah especially midwinter or if we're done surfing we realized we needed a place to to hang things and what makes the most sense is to be able to do it here inside so we actually just built this kind of fold flat system to be able to hang wetsuits to be able to hang winter gear and that way everything drips down into obviously kind of a front step so that it simply runs out of the vehicle again we looked high and low for the best awning and when we were in Baja we actually watched two awnings on RVs fold up over the vehicles and in a windstorm and so we went to look at marine stores and found this awning that's built for a boat to be out Wow under way and so as where most RV awnings will fold themselves up at about five miles an hour of winds this one's actually good up until hurricane force winds so 55 miles an hour you can leave the awning out so we can keep working for you rather than folding it up when you need it the most  we went to a show down in Arizona all three days the winds were gusting between 45 and 65 miles an hour and so literally everyone had to roll up their awning and putting away and got sunburns in the process and we just left ours out for the three days we were there it's not hydraulic it's actually a screw-type but there's two two actuators on the side that basically allow this to coil up inside of itself stainless steel again built for marine environment so built for way worse environments than will ever take our van to by nature and then simply coils up inside of itself when it when it folds back up definitely one of the best features we put on the VIN and then will eventually come back and put a second one out the back so that when we're trying to access our gear then we'll actually have from some protection back here as well and this is simply our garage this is our gear storage and so everything under the bed about a third of the way forward allows for the backpacking and the rock climbing the grill the barbecue and then everything over here is the volleyball / surf zone so our surfboards go in and can be stored inside and again it's important for us to not strap a lot of things to the top and the outside because we spend so much time stealth camping and so if everything's inside we simply look like a work van and so it's a lot easier for people to not assume we're on the inside and come knocking when we'd rather they don't come knocking did you guys you signed it in abstract and then you just built it or yeah we well again much like we did our garage and other spaces we design everything in 3d first and so it just seems like when you're trying to make sure you capture every square inch of a space the best way to do it is to actually start with the volume exactly as it is and figure out how to literally start carving away every square inch as you go for us it's all the way down to you know each outlet being something that can actually fold up or fold back out to plug into  cutting boards Able Seaman actually have drawer slides yeah and then over here we've got pantry space what kind of about that gist do you think you can get by design your own vehicle from Chuseok romantic locks or cost I think it's huge in both but it's also probably not fair for me to say because I'm a designer yeah and then definitely prep space somewhere and we eat a lot of vegetables so but it there's plenty of people out there that are building their own bands from scratch and so everybody has the access to do that it's just a question of ability and or confidence to do so I mean many of the things we talked about inside we had never done before either it was lots of watching YouTube and reading books to figure out how to do things and it's working I mean we've still got a ways to go we've got a lot of things we still have to finish but like everything else it's more important for us to get out and start using it rather than sit in the shop and finish it  [Music] we talked to a lot of people who want to spend more time outdoors they want to live in a van they want to do whatever that thing is but they spend so much time planning and thinking and worrying that they don't ever actually leave but I don't know that you know without just jumping and spending time you know whether it be living in a van or whether it just be living in a very small space if you're still living in a five bedroom home it's almost impossible to know what it is you want or what you need it's basically a map of our travels and most of this started as kind of tracking our trip south which was all the way down Baja Ferry Dover came across Mexico all the way down through Central America almost to Panama and then back up and around and then we're late in putting several tacks in because now it's pretty much the entire west coast to the US has been tracked over the last five years got some Southeast Asia we've got some Europe and right now we we've actually chosen to be traveling by van primarily because we want the dog to be with us and so right now most of our travel is very much limited by what we can drive to and then we don't like to talk about it but when she's no longer with us we'll start expanding the horizons again right now it feels like we could do it forever but we're certainly open to the fact that things change as we age but at least so far we're just as comfortable at living this way as we are not and it also provides the freedom to to travel and explore so why wouldn't we which is why most days we're in the band instead of here because we have we've got the ability to do it now we'd be crazy not to", "fhCv3J7hmFc": "a couple were renovating this beautiful chateau when they uncovered some astonishing treasures Kraig and korrina waters are embroiled in an epic DIY project now we're not talking about a measly extension or even building a new house from scratch nope for these two it's all about renovating a huge 94 room French mansion and what they're finding inside is nothing short of mind-blowing it all started back in 2011 at that time Carina her two kids and surgeon husband Craig were living in Perth Australia which needless to say is a long way from the south of France nevertheless the South of France was exactly where the family were planning to undertake their next adventure yes karena and craggy decided that they wanted to buy a home in the region therefore they flew out to Dordogne to check out some houses selected from them by French friends none of the properties were however quite ticking the right boxes the problem they were all unfortunately devoid of character apparently the houses were either too clean or too contemporary so the couple had to return to Perth empty-handed in fact they came close to giving up until out of the blue Karina's son Ben found a property online and what a property it was this was a dilapidated fairytale Chateau around 435 miles south of Paris and it looked so good with a couple wasted no time and jumping out of Trance pound plane in order to view it it was love at first sight Trina told The Good Life France as we approached the village we could see the chateau we both looked at each other it was just like being at the altar and by 2013 the property was theirs there was however much work to do before we continue with the rest of the video we could use your help me click that like button to help spread the word about watch Jojo and also be sure to subscribe and click the notification bell so you don't miss our future videos after all sheshu doo de Gong was constructed back in the mid 18th century on the same location as a long gone 13th century fort it was the work of well-known DeSales family who had much influence in the area in fact the Chateau was famous for its grand parties which were attended by the likes of Voltaire and other famous intellectuals moreover it was spared from destruction during the French Revolution after it was acquired by another wealthy local family later in the 1990s Chateau du de Gaulle was purchased by a syndicate that hopes to turn it into upmarket apartments but after years of deliberation during which the property's condition drastically deteriorated the group's plans were denied this Chateau was therefore placed back on the market when Karina finally got her hands on it then she decided to stay in France to oversee the chateaus extensive renovation Kraig meanwhile headed back to Perth to look after the kids at this stage of the project I must confess that my eyes were shut tight and that denial was sweetly comforting Karina told the goodbye France but as work started on this epic dwelling its secrets began to be revealed it was in fact like the giant time capsule indeed with its original fireplaces elegant window frames and a sweeping central staircase it offered a fascinating glimpse into a luxurious past for instance the walls which were decorated by centuries old paint displayed exquisite murals and frescoes what's more the grand house kept revealing more and more with pretty much every room containing a revealing surprise one in particular Karina discovered contain the opening to a concealed tunnel yes the small entrance led down to a tunnel that burrows at least nine feet below the Chateau another room was covered in faded wallpaper that on closer inspection appeared to date from the days of the French colonial empire by this point then the waters family must have been over the moon with their purchase but it very nearly didn't happen at all that's because Karina had big plans for the Chateau and these needed to be approved by local authorities the process proved to be incredibly long-winded in fact by the time they were eventually given the green light months later Karina had seriously considered throwing in the towel regardless renovations are now well underway but Karina isn't necessarily planning to restore the property to its exact former glory Buddhists used the term wabi-sabi and we want to apply that to the Chateau du du Gong she explained to the good life France Wahby connotes rustic simplicity or understated elegance sabi is beauty or serenity that comes with age Karina is also choosing to keep the locals in the loop every step of the way because of the changes she's overseeing so each week she heads down to a local bistro to update her neighbors about things that are progressing we have signed the contract picked up the key and have now stopped worrying she added we're committed to our decision and have no doubt it's the right thing for us to do indeed the waters family have grand plans for the completed chateau they want to equip it for conferences weddings vacations and more it won't be a typical hotel style setup but a unique experience Karina explained today the Chateau has its very own website and a superflee designed one at that and as the build progresses Karina will keep the site which even features a boat cheek section so that the family can raise extra funds update there is however still a very long way to go please don't forget to share this video with your friends below please don't forget to subscribe and activate the panel

heater into itself  this setup serves two main functions number one it can be used as an off-grid water heater secondly it can be used as an off-grid space heater which is what I built mine for last year I constructed a snowmobile camper since then I've been exploring ways to heat it during the winter months and by the way if you want to check out my snowmobile camper series I'll leave a link in the description below anyway my plan is to run hot water from an outside campfire into my camper where it will circulate into this metal ammo box the ammo box will radiate its heat inside the camper making it toasty warm even when it's freezing cold outside this setup is a great way to bring the heat of the fire inside while keeping the fire itself safely outside I chose this ammo box because of its tall and slim profile which will fit nicely into my camper without taking up too much space let's get started I drilled two holes into the ammo box one on the top which will be the hot water inlet and the second lower down on the side which will be an outlet for the cooler water  for the valves I purchased a couple rain barrel spigots I found that they created a good seal against the tank and the nozzles were threaded which is perfect for easily connecting and disconnecting the water lines  [Music]  my plan is to run hot water into this jar where it will then drain into the tank the jar isn't necessary but I added it so that I could watch the water circulate for the water lines I used metal braided flexi hose  for the copper I bought a 40-foot 5/8 coil of soft copper from the hardware store the soft copper is easy to bend by hand without the use of tools  finally I added an aquarium water thermometer to the tank I made sure the temperature Perl rested at the bottom so that I could get a reading from the coolest part of the tank  now it was time to test my creation  after building a small fire I place the coil on top  almost immediately the hot water began to flow things were looking good that is until steam started blasting out of the top  to avoid pressure buildup I left an opening in the jar which steam was now forcing its way out of as long as there was steam the water could no longer circulate in liquid form to replenish the tank I quickly realized that my problem was in the positioning of the hot water inlet since I placed it at the top of the tank it was above the water line  so I got rid of the jar and drilled a new inlet hole higher off on the side of the tank but this time I made sure it was below the waterline now there wouldn't be any room for air to get trapped in the lines and creates steam like it had before however I left the hole at the top open to prevent pressure build-up after hooking my lines back up I place the coil back in the fire for round two  this time everything worked perfectly almost right away I could feel hot water jetting in through the upper intake valve here's what it looked like from the inside of the tank [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  within 15 to 20 minutes the upper half of the ammo box was too hot to touch the bottom of the tank registered 30 degrees Celsius or 87 degrees Fahrenheit while the top of the tank was twice as hot at 70 degrees Celsius or 155 degrees Fahrenheit  my ammo box heater operates on the method of thermal siphoning which is based on natural convection the heated water in the coil naturally rises within the tubing while the cooler more dense water sinks back into the coil where it reheats and rises again the longer the water is allowed to circulate the hotter it becomes  within 45 minutes the temperature in the tank began to equalize from top to bottom and in just under an hour the tank began to slowly boil  it was at this point that I removed the copper coil from the fire  two hours later the tank was still burning hot at approximately 70 degrees Celsius or 160 degrees Fahrenheit overall I'm extremely pleased with how efficient the ammo box heater is I still want to tweak the system a little bit to improve upon the design but I couldn't be happier with the initial results", "HNTfLGt59qo": "[Applause]  the carpenter chooses straight knotless pine trees from which to build a log house  [Applause]  [Music]  the trees are usually felled in the mid winter while the moon is waxing these men are going to build a log cottage consisting of a small Hall a bedroom and a living room the site is on the Luther Keller farm in the parish of swarmin in southeastern Finland [Music] to make hewing with a broad axe easier the work is started with a normal axe with which the surface parts of the logs are cut off a quarter of an inch is left on each side of the log to be hewn with a broad axe lugs are hewn and the hewn timber is allowed to dry in the March wind bark is removed from the unhewn side with the logs to help them dry to provide thermal insulation an earth bank will be made inside the stone base coals will be left in the stone base for ventilation they're called cats holes using crosswise measurement the check is made to see that the angles in a timber building the underside of every log is shaped so that it fits the log under it the bottom log is shaped to fit the stone base the corners are sealed by means of thermal holes filled with tari wadding  here in Finland buildings with horizontal logs probably go back to the great migration of nations at least as early as the 13th century we have had round log buildings with edge joints with round bottom holes in the 16th century builders started hewing war timber on the inside wall timber hewn on both sides as here dates for the 18th century  feather Moss is put between the wall timbers and ot\u00c3\u00a1rio come in the joints of the corners doors and windows the wall timber is strengthened by fixing it with dowels placed in holes Ward through the timber the size of the hand borer is about one and a half inches when dowling enough room must be left for settling in the bottom of the holes a good inch per meter the holes for the dowels of the doors and windows are bored with a two inch drill the joints in the Timbers of the wall between the hall and the bedroom don't go through the side walls instead the Timbers are joined to them with dovetail joints the notch of the joint reaches the middle of the 6-inch timber this building will have long timber ends at the corners just like two other buildings on the same farm  the notches of the joints are about half an inch deep on both sides the space between the wall timbers must be wide enough for proper thermal insulation the width of the space must be at least four inches in the outside wall the back of the lower timber is hewn evenly arched the shape of the lower timber is drawn on the upper timber with a stylus the timber being human is kept in place with a dog the groove between the Timbers into which stuffing will be placed is huge so that its sides are straight when a timber is laid on the one below the space for stuffing will be somewhat open on the sides this makes it easier to fill the space with moss the upper edges of the door and the window will be at the same height dowel pins strengthen the door and window openings  dowel pins strengthen the door and window openings here the t-shaped dowel pin is made of one log just as it used to be long straight grained pine trees have been chosen as the wall timber the courses of timber a dowel that intervals of about five feet to keep the walls straight the lintel beam must be cut from a stout straight pine tree because this beam which binds the whole building is weakened by the window opening this plank will not be nailed down because it would present the wall timber from settling the window opening must be large enough to give a two-inch settling space between the frame and the lintel beam the joists are planed smooth before being placed in position  and it yet the edges a little the way with a knife how the finishing is done with a plane the dovetail shaped scores of the joists are made when the walls are level with the joists the scores reach as far as the middle of the wall timber a dovetail fitting the sport ight Li is hewn on the end of the joist the old way of lifting heavy timber high is to roll it using logs and rope  in buildings the pediments two are often made of logs the shape of the pediment is drawn using a model the ridge beam is made of two logs joined together with a hook joint because a log of the full language is not available the roof truss structure is very simple the trusses are supported by the ridge beam the walls and to supporting joists the roof trusses are nailed onto the ridge beam joists and walls the timber ends of the pediments and the partition walls are hewn level with the roof trusses are originally was fixed with pegs both of the ends and at the partition wall the final hewing of both the inside and outside walls near the roof and the ceiling has to be done before the roof is made finishing the wall timber with a broad axe is one of the most demanding jobs for the carpenter  and this sort of an axe I makes it possible to turn the axe handle easily so that this axe can be used both right and left-handed this is necessary when hewing the corners the barge board is fixed onto the ends of the roof trusses and on the barge board comes another board the so called drop board the projecting ends of the logs of the corners are half an inch longer than the thickness of the wall timber if the wall is six inches thick the log ends are seven inches long the log ends of the corners are as thick as the wall itself when making a shingle roof supporting shingles are placed first under the line board the line displays a good inch further than the drop a normal shingle roof has three layers the shingles in the first layer are short about a third of an ordinary shingle the shingles must be set the right way the shingles are about 17 inches long the length of one layer is five inches only every second shingle in the layer is nailed down the heads of the nails are hidden under the upper layer  a well-made roof good shingles can last a quarter of a century [Music]  the supporting shingles which went into place first arc us last [Music]  to strengthen the edge skirt boards are nailed on the gables and ridge boards on the top roof it's the custom to give a party once the riddle the ceremony of raising the roof tree has its origin and the past when neighborly help was needed to raise a heavy roof tree the helpers were rewarded with a party under the living-room floor the earth bank beside the stone base provides thermal insulation birch bark is traditionally used to protect the timber structure under the floor against decay floor making begins by laying logs inside the walls the space between the wall and the log is about two and a half feet proper ventilation is vital to keep the timber there in good repair that's why ventilation channels are built out of brick and stone  the corners of the log framework under the floor have hewn joints  the floor joists which rest partly on the logs near the walls are laid in the crosswise directions between the wall and the joist next to it is a five inch wide space for earth filling this is covered with a plank the so-called earth plank there is an earth plank beside each wall the flanks are not fixed and are held in place only by the skirting boards in the middle there is a room that can be used for cold storage access is through a trapdoor in the floor  there is enough settling space between the window frame and the lintel beam so the frame can be put into place and fastened with wedges the frame can't be nailed onto the wall timber because of the settling of the walls it can be nailed only on the dowel pins on both sides of the window [Music]  a spirit level is used to make sure the frame is exactly horizontal and vertical  the frame is then fastened with nails  the window frames complete with panes and hinges can now be put into place a  lot of hard wadding is put between the frame and the wall this is then covered by a broad covering board [Music]  floor making begins with the border planks which are laid first inside the framework of the border planks the floor planks are fixed to each other to form a compact floor the floor timber consists of unaged planks with nuts broader than tops these are cut ready and laid alternately the floor timber is made of good dry pine to avoid twisting  the floor planks are joined together with pegs the broad floor planks will dry and shrink before long that's why they are not nailed together putting the pegs at short intervals makes the floor firm and prevents it twisting in the warm room the floor timber will get steadily drier in a couple of years a narrow plank will have to be added it's easy to do because the floor timbers are not nailed together the skirting boards for this sort of floor must be stronger than usual because they keep the logs beside the walls in place the floor is finished by planing it's smooth the small hall and the bedroom will have double floors supporting boards are nailed onto the floor joists and onto them the boards of the lower floor  tarred paper is put on the lower floor and on top of this a thick layer of dry sawdust  this new building will have the same sort of ceiling as the farmhouse there is tarred paper on the ceiling and on it sawdust and planing chips as thermal insulation the traditional front door made of planks by the carpenters has forged hinges a joiner in the neighborhood has made the other doors and windows on the traditional model  the covering boards and skirting boards are made by the carpenters themselves [Music] building the log house as traditional carpentry has been an inspiring job and an excellent chance for the carpenters to try and refresh traditional carpentry using tools many of which already belong to yesterday [Music] you", "7OfTrpg3ZZs": "so last time we're out on the trail on this thing I noticed two things one everybody had a rooftop tent two everybody had on the back of their rigs their Instagram handle and three everybody had these really expensive coolers so we're gonna show you how to do all those three things right now so if you haven't already be sure to hit that subscribe button down below and give this video a great big thumbs up and check out this little project we're gonna do so I went online to go buy a rooftop tent turns out they're really expensive like over a thousand dollars so a plan B rooftop tent Instagram accounts are free so this shouldn't be too hard so here's my current cooler it's a regular Coleman cooler it's been great I've had it for over 15 years it's still holding up well but I want to see what the difference was between this cooler and the really expensive coolers so if you go in some of the other channels there's actually one where they cut this thing in half and they cut one of the expensive ones in half and I've got that link in the description below if you want to check it out but what it comes down to really is a couple things one the wall thicknesses are a little thicker on the big ones too these have foam insulation inside the walls but the lids are actually hollow there's no foam up here inside the lid and then the third thing is they say these ones are bear proof or actually the expensive ones are bear proof this one obviously not so bear proof so we're gonna tackle the things that we can on this cooler to make this cooler as close as we can to some of these coolers that you can spend four or five hundred bucks on now the easiest thing on this cooler to change is here and take off this lid so we can work on and now we have the lid loose so we can work in there so what we're gonna do is we're gonna figure out a way to put some insulation inside this lid now the stuff we're going to be using to insulate the lid is this this is great stuff expanding foam it's pretty cool stuff you can spray it inside through the little hose that it comes with and it'll expand out and fill all the little crevices so go ahead and pick yourself up some of this you can get it for four or five bucks at your local hardware store I've also got a link for it in the description below so the next thing you're gonna do you're going to get your little straw applicator and pick out a drill bit that's a little bit bigger than that straw applicator and we're going to go into all of our tall areas here and just drill a little holes just big enough that we can get that straw through and spray foam around so we're gonna drill some holes so with all those holes drilled the next thing we have to do is spray this stuff in there now this stuff is pretty awesome it expands a lot but the one thing I will caution you about is if you get this stuff on your skin you're in for a bad time it's not gonna hurt or anything but it is darn near impossible to get off so try your hardest not to get on your skin if you want to wear gloves I'm not gonna wear gloves I'm just gonna try my best not to but if you start getting foam out of the holes don't pick at it until it's dry once as dry it's really easy to break off but when it's wet it just makes a terrible mess so we're gonna give it a good shake and start getting it inside all these holes  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Music]  and now you'll see it will start to expand and come out all those holes and that is normal this stuff is expanding away while it's in there you want to let it completely dry before you do anything else with it so just let it sit let it expand it'll fill up all those crevices insulate your cooler out real nice and then we will chip off the foam that's come out of the holes so I've let the foam cure up for about 24 hours now it is good and hard you want to make sure this is good and harden all the way through you don't want it soft in the middle because when you start prying these things up you don't want goop to get all over your hands now it's pretty easy from this point just start picking off the foam they came out through the holes so he took some time to really scrape everything off there's still little bits here in there and I'm gonna finish getting that off but here's a little tip if you can't get it off with the chisel get a scraper a brush like this a barbecue brush it really helps break up some little bits of foam so now with our lid insulated we need to worry about these holes and you don't want moisture to get in those holes and grow mold inside your lid so you want to seal them up with something you can give a blob of hot glue in there whatever you do do something food safe can get food safe silicone or something along those lines fill up those holes you don't get moisture inside your lid so after you do that we're just gonna put the lid back on the cooler and we have two more things we got to take care of after that  all right so we've got our cooler here and it is insulated from the top now so that's taken care of we've got better insulation one of the other things was really expensive coolers claim is they claim that they are bear proof now it's gonna be kind of tough to make this thing bear proof where is it I have an idea if it works for other areas I figured it would work here too so we met ourselves a little no bears logo right here on the 3d printer and we were gonna stick that right here on a cooler so all the Bears know this is a no bear cooler that ought to keep them away so now that we've got our extra insulated bear proof cooler we want to make sure that people don't get this thing confused with it's much more expensive brethren out there so we made this little logo to avoid any confusion not a Yeti and we're gonna stick that thing right here on the front so we don't confuse anybody with our new sweet hi-tech cooler now if you want to get these logos and you don't have a 3d printer I do have a link in the description below where you can download the files and I'm gonna try to find a place that can actually print these for you too so check out the description below so if this video helped you out at all please give it a great big thumbs up leave a comment down below let us know what other kind of projects that you want to see and make sure you go outside and have some fun this weekend go outside and use your cooler have an adventure thanks a lot for watching", "5voBFW1fQPs": "just watching out that in addition to 10 guest speakers at this year's tiny house summer camp five in Vermont a fully hands-on building workshop will be bringing out some off-grid lightweight soul of our solar ovens as part of live demonstrations and we still have more live demos to announce check these guys out too so levar calm hey I'm deke from relaxed calm and Taos New Mexico anyways we're here at the earthships I'm with here with Ashley who's giving us so kind of give us a tour want you tell us your title usage so my name is Ashley Turin and I work in the educational facility at Earthship biotech sir alright so we're going to go in this one today this is one of the newer homes built by Earthship biotech sir it is a two bedroom single bathroom home with an attached garage we like to call it the way B house Mike Reynolds the owner inventor of ership biotech sure he does like to name all of the home so welcome to the way behalf alright so we're going to start by just entering the drive in the garage I guess one so this is a full - - Parker Oz and so we're going to come on in so all of the earth shifts they're made with about 45 percent recycled material so you'll see a lot of bottles cans and car tires especially if you come to Towson and see some mid construction build but some of this bottle work is very tastefully done and it kind of acts is almost like a stained glass window but it's mostly filler for all the walls so very easy building and you don't have to purchase as many materials when you have something filling the inside that will just throw a couple parties you're good to go right what's the bottle of choice whether it seemed to be um blue bottles are like gold yellow to go in a wine oh yeah so this is actually a very tasteful wall this is all clear bottles here but in different homes all the homes are custom all over the world so you'll see a lot of different colorful bottle walls blue is our favorite some of the liquor bottles and wine bottles are preference well come on in this is the main greenhouse hallway we like to call it a buffer zone especially during the wintertime this will hold a little more heat in here so that we're almost tricking the interior space into thinking that this temperature out here is the outside temperature during the summer time what we can do to cool this base office earning this is the pop some of these windows okay I'm noticing overhead two water roller guide lights path right here these are all gravity operated skylights and so this gives a lot of nice airflow coming in and out of the home airflow is obviously key but when we come into the interior space of the home you can actually feel quite a temperature shift in here oh and very noticeably it is very noticeable temperature shift it's a lot cooler in this room it is close to 90 outside right now and it's probably if I were to get about 68 to 71 degrees in here but this home because it is tapping into the cool earth temperature this wall back here will stay a lot of constant 55 to 58 degrees this is what we call our thermal mass temperature and this temperature will stay pretty constant all year round and so whether it's 100 or negative 30 outside you've got a constant thermal mass wall kind of similar to a cave temperature or basement temperature are those returns over there one of those you're actually cooling to cooling today we are in the newest global model York ship all of the global model Earth ships they have the cooling tube just taking advantage of the cool underground temperatures yes you can see this goes all the way through the berm of the house so just like a cave or a basement we do have about 15 to 20 feet of compacted earth the wall at March or yeah or if you had a natural hillside on your property you could build right into the hillside it will tap into that pool earth temperature and that thermal mass temperature can store itself in the wall but this tube goes all the way through a few tire courses up because this is a tire wall so compacted earth tire wall that's earthquake-proof fire-proof of no off gassing from the tires this goes all the way through the berm that big mass of dirt behind the house and is open on the other side so it's rainin imagine a rain dance and a little critter rattling rattle saying we have a lot of those in this area but all of the air now if you have everything vented properly this cooling tube exposed my windows to the greenhouse and also those skylights that we showed you this will act as a natural convection and so the air will get pulled through and it will cool down as it travels underground and then all the warm air will get pushed out and up through the natural arrives as you're pulling all the cool yeah it's almost like a geothermal energy but no electricity no moving parts it's all pretty natural and so this is kind of our natural form of air conditioned my colder if you're familiar with my Kohler The Mole Man or Malcolm wells Rob Roy they used similar practices or different variations of and it's so simple but it works so well you can feel the cool air coming through here it feels like air conditioning but it just gets more cool air in the house pushing out the warm air and obviously getting fresh air indigo because this wall is you know you know that there's no windows on this wall and it's because this is a complete tire structure rammed earth tire is coming all the way up and so this is just Earth's behind this wall for about 15 to 20 feet now up about sorry I mean up above us so these are some pretty serious raptors these are called bigas here in South New Mexico or just in the New Mexico area in general this is a very traditional building style so these videos I believe that they are made out of pine they are sustainably harvest alert in an area this is very traditional for a house kind of Adobe looking home and these walls these are all adobe walls are made out of sand straw mud and water these ones have a light coat of paint over top of them but you can see the flecks of straw in here I wouldn't use any kind of paint you don't want to use a latex paint there's a specific type of paint that goes well with the mud so if you're doing mud walls earthen walls make sure you know what you're putting on yeah but how much earth is up above us I'm you know seeing as these rafters are just so huge well this is very traditional roof you've got your these vegans obviously we've got insulation above these planks and then when and you can head to the roof over at our educational facility we will go on this one but it will see a lot of metal Pro paneling so the roof is not underground the metal Pro paneling on the roof is because all of these columns they collect all their own water for rain and snow so all of these homes they are completely off grid doing water collection from rain and snow energy control you know we don't have to heat or cool the house because of this thermal mass wall and the southern exposed windows this is passive solar gain at its best right here so we get just enough light and heat to make it so the home is about 65 to 75 degrees inside the home at any period during the year so like I said earlier whether it's 100 outside or negative 30 you'll have a constant temperature in here but we also do energy collection from solar panels or windmill we also use about 45 percent recycled materials in every single bill and my favorite component of the home is the gray water system we recycle the water here so hey you guys anybody was washing the dishes taking a shower doing the laundry we do have laundry machines internships that's all the first use for the water when this water goes down the drain it actually goes a really light reason particle filter before it hits all the plants or beds there's wonder if it came out right here he was a quick little buffer zone of plants here is what it is and this if you keep in here and be hard then that will be a light grease and particle filtering Oh inside there we just have a really light panty hose that can catch anything out but some people like to turn that into a worm that will start it off as a very easy grease and particle filter and if the homeowner wants to turn it into a worm bin they can do that on our own but it goes through a system like that before all the water hits all the planter beds in the home so the plant after you take a shower or take a drink of water or run a laundry the plants get all the second use for the water and then that gray water gets pumped to the toilet tank so the toilet water is the third use for the same water in the home and because the plants do such a nice job with filtering that water you'll notice that it doesn't smell funny and it looks funny it looks like normal toilet water and if your dog drinks out of it it's not that easy so basically if you go into an Earthship and see that the plants are doing so well you know that someone's hygiene isn't up to par now they're not showering it up that's how are you like this because I use this thing as an example just so everybody knows this sink water actually goes right to black water just in case of any food particles that get through it's mainly the shower the laundry all of that water goes right to the plants after the the plants and then the toilet then that black water goes to a very traditional septic unit outside before it goes to the Blackwater Botanical cell aka all the exterior gardening so it goes through a leach field outside and Enzi's into a lined planter bed outside is the fourth use for the same water so there's plants really flourish you can grow food out there with the black water as long as it's something with a trunk or a stem you wouldn't want to grow root vegetables in your black what's the average rainfall around this area we only get in between eleven inches around let's see walking long after this you guys will see a very unique fridge this is a DC refrigerator it's very insulated thick walled it runs off direct current we use both DC and eight while VI see how thick the information there yet very fun Frost right I think I saw the process made here in the US this home and I'm not exactly sure how much this one has I think it has about 8,000 gallons of water storage will see the catchment space on the roof but if you've got light rainfall like we do here in Taos you want a lot of water storage and you want a lot of reap storage or you want reach space I'm sorry to touch that water here's just yeah what's your dryer luxurious and these cabinets we talked about before they're all hands yeah these are all hands are simple yet classy my god oh yeah they were like Mike Reynolds the owner inventor I mean this company is really known for beautiful handcrafted cabinets door window water poison juice yeah they're beautiful and she's also known for the tyre walls what everyone knows Mike for is the higher walls they call them the garbage warrior this bedroom number one I was a bathroom this is a very modern bathroom this one even has a very modern tub some of the older earthships have a lot of handcrafted tubs they look very whimsical that's really very traditional but to get back to the water question cuz we're standing in the bathroom here we get some ice on boria's we're standing in the bathroom here if we did not use the water four times and have so much water storage and large root spaces there is a chance that we could run out of water we get light rainfall but their ship was invented in this area so there is kind of a rough calculation of how much a storage space that you want and how much room space that you want but if you were to get 2 inches of rainfall a year that's when I would be a little concerned my house has 8,000 gallons of water storage and I never run but let's head through the greenhouse to bedroom number two and you can see this beautiful floating headboard right here Mike loved to do these in the homes because it gives a lot of storage space behind the headboard for all your clothes so this is kind of the closet for this home and it's just right behind the headboard it's a simple open closet it works yeah so we got we have to go through the greenhouse to get to bedroom number two so we'll head back out here and be more of a beautiful bottle work coming through here yeah the doors to would be like exact no table aspects job is much this is Mike's you know this is his signature look he does a lot of this this style of window door cabinetry but like I said this is a newer model of Earthship so this is a little more streamlined and a little more classy so to speak it's nice because it shows the average homeowner that you can live in an off-grid home and still have all your modern amenities and still feel good about higher living and let's pop in here there's another bedroom or a sorry bathroom in this emissive with the more custom shower area this is a custom shower so unfortunately I can't get you into one of the older models of earthships but if you can imagine this shower but as a handcrafted tub we do a lot of handcrafted tub with the cans and bottles and they look like pieces of artwork other great strap over here as well where plants run and Willie the garden while you're going to the bath yeah and you can see all the storage space in here more of Mike that's a heck of a lot of storage yeah well there was a point in time where folks they wanted a little storage in the Earthship and so since this is more than your home might try to add as much storage as he could possibly fit so you can see there is another cooling tube here so yeah the air a little more through here there's not too much temperature problems in this room at all because the tire wall kind of goes all the way around in a circle in this home so this are in this room so this room is really really nice and cool so i usually tor a lot of tiny houses with the beds are about 20 inches wide this is certainly a different case here that's bigger than some of the tiny houses I tour around my youtube yes tiny houses are amazing I love them I would like to have one they're a little more mobile this is definitely not my oh no these tyre walls with different intention here there's a different intention I mean these tyre walls they they weigh anywhere from two to four hundred pounds per tire once you can pack them that's why the wall is said to be earthquake-proof and fireproof and all of this good stuff but the tiny house you can take a loop with um some very stationary and these tiny plants you can see in here this is sense as a branding Earthship we just have little baby plants going right now Japanese cucumbers peppers tomatoes things we've got mammoth basil we've got thyme a little bit of every pot smells fantastic there's Walker I know it's very a yeah yeah yeah thank you so much for the tour - Ashley oh you're both appreciate it website wise they want to find more of my yellow eww chef calm that website has not only a lot of our information regarding the house but educational programs that we've here so you could do an internship with us or the Academy program where you actually take classroom hours and build on a site with the crew hopefully you'll be able to build one of these things by the time your month is done it's certainly inspiring to see me again a documentary and have some of the books from Michael Reynolds and oh yeah and thank you for the fantastic tours like you've done this tour before yes oh yeah here's why alright like blood yeah you're welcome bye guys", "LUqr8MMKjxg": "no I'm I'm so gasps I'm gonna have to check for so many pics after this oh yeah alright what is up guys it's Noah here and today we were exploring an amazing abandoned log mansion it's just in the middle of nowhere but it's so crazy it's it's unlike any other abandoned spot I've ever seen super sick big shout out to Ethan for the help on this one well not even the help for finding this one this was a pain in the ass I look for like two like days straight almost just for this so it's gonna be sick I'm hyped to check this one out and yeah let's go explore [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] alright guys so I don't know what this is for here but looks like they would have like old wagon wheels almost hanging from it like that was just one but it's just split in half now this place is incredible like if that like without even going inside it's incredible we actually it  geez this is like a dream home to find  at their garage holy  that's crazy okay that's what the go in  so you can see the garage over there was that three car for car here's the front of the house holy crap that's a shame though look how nice the house is  literally though that is ridiculous oh my god all right guys we're gonna go inside check it out see what's up that's creepy Oh door swinging  oh my god  welcome thank you  holy holy Wow bro what are you saying about this I don't even this that's shaded like what he call me Jesus man I mean it's been right think it's been a little bit more wrapped up since we saw them go but who cares guys this is incredible look at this staircase in here Wow it's all it seems like it's all real wood I mean it would make sense it's a log cabin how do you think like this is pretty fire so there obviously was a railing here there obviously was a railing here but it looks like some kids have come through and they've demolished it pretty much as you can see it's sitting over here she's cool what I think is cool is how they mixed in like the brickwork with the actual house  jeez man  somebody set a fire in here you can see I mean of course there's gonna be a fireplace and somewhere like this there's no way that they're not gonna have that  so this is just another entrance from the main patio in the backyard the deck sorry  it's in here  interesting law firm choice  got a bidet and then the regular toilet I think it's cool everything's like with the green pattern and like the nature bar in there they've got some birds I like a branch and they have the wood tram it all feels like it fits really well  sounds like a closet that they had she's cool like this is almost like a resort that's what it feels like I think the style of the house  just another washroom geez I might be a little bit windy guys that they are noisy with the wind imagine your bathtub being right here and this is where you look at it taking your bath that's your view and you got a nice mirror and then even over here you've got there was glass for the shower it all ran like right here but that's obviously then smashed it's everywhere on the ground this house this this one of the houses I've been wanting to see since it wasn't discovered it is absolutely amazing all right so that's gonna do it for this room here now we're gonna walk over and check out the kitchen  look at this kitchen here man  super-nice to get the fireplace in the kitchen look at the old stove look at that that's super nice tiling at the back at the pipe that runs up I'm gonna guess this there was a sink or something here I'm not sure  old appliances old microwave  all wood cabinets like this is that fridge actually yeah this is the fridge they hid the fridge within the style at the home that's amazing and the refrigerator's down there - got a big hood so they're really cooking in here it seems like seems like they're really this is a home though so it wasn't just like a little getaway log cabin in my opinion got the four burners at the top they were set up then over here I'm gonna guess over here was a dining room possibly it might have been a living room pretty sure the living rooms that room over there but this I think would have been some sort of dining room a formal eating area alright so we're gonna go check upstairs now guys first of all though this beautiful staircase  so sick I like the green carpeting with it  then from up here I feel like at that crazy chandelier I mean it's been it's been really vandalized there's a brick in it and there's that and there's no outside light but you know is what it is  possibly a bedroom be crazy bedroom  needs that right over the front of the house  look at this washroom really crap man  so we also smash the glass in here but again like this washroom is really nice fancy and you get a view outside kind of you can see from the actual bathtub itself but it's definitely nice awesome for sure then I mean obviously the woodwork in here absolutely amazing and then that thing up there that's a heat lamp for the room you can taught me that  what do you think so far one of the best best mansions I've seen then I'm guessing these are bedrooms I mean they're really nice bedrooms are like it's almost like a t-shaped bedroom but you've got the big fan at the top woodwork again beautiful nice big beans everything's stained really nicely it doesn't smell like an abandoned house smells like a wood log cabin  then from this bedroom here's the view you get might be windy but sorry but there's your nice square ways down to look at this the yeah I didn't even noticed that literally so this house like really really reminds me of something you find a Muskoka and that's kind of where we assumed this house would have been but I mean the odds of us finding something like this in Muskoka that's abandoned with the thousands of log managers that are there super unlikely so we're happy we found it one of my favorite spots of the year so far personally I mean we just hit a really nice time capsule the other day but this is just so unique it's so different it's awesome  alright guys we're gonna go venture now into the basement apparently smells like fire so that's something to keep enough a mind over these stairs are insane oh my god I can't see anything yet does my fire  but their bar you're like the bar just so much would work in this house man oh  the whole room that's like the only sort of spray-paint I've seen in this whole house is that one little mark so far yes if it's even these could have been bedrooms down here too I mean kids were in here punching holes in the wall or kicking holes yeah I know kicking you can see the footprint  the bathrooms in this house are crazy-looking they're all nice and the doors intact big ol near and see yourself and there's angels that's interesting too  Wow there is if you look there's angels all of painted above here for change  think this room doesn't fit the rest of the house it's like the only one that doesn't but the the roof tiling or whatever is interesting the ceiling tiling yeah yeah laughs I mean it's fine  not sure what this room was but you can see the kicks and the walls and stuff it's a shame for such a beautiful house  so this is really the only graffiti that's in this house and there's some over here it says Bloods stuff like that but I mean other than that house is pretty much perfect still other than the vandalism I mean this once you know where this house is it's not super hard to find it so I mean the local kids have definitely come here and done a number on it but you know so brick in the frickin in the sink the hell's in here [Applause] I guess I guess they were putting in a sauna cuz there's the rocks for it but they either took it out or they never finished it that should be what it is  then this is just unfinished in here so just go by it it's a big storage area  under the stairs nothing really else in here doors are like solid would do I don't know what kind of wood but guess this is the laundry room probably trying to wind the window closed yeah I don't think it's gonna work for all the actual arms working it's funny okay guys so we're on the balcony you'd say I had two huge skylight so you can see all the glasses down here and shattered door inside something that's really cool it's this you'd see right here there's a spiral staircase that goes all the way down like a took an iron spiral staircase look at that it's so sick with yeah with a barbecue that some kids threw over  yes oh it just happened Ethan so you're out front and taking some pictures and a couple of the residents nearby came and basically a couple words with us and they're actually over there right now walking in the front door savage if you say say the least but actually the guys were super super nice they're just telling us how the houses like I was like a hundred this thing was like a hundred years old or something oh yeah said it was historic I don't know if that's true or not but said that like a year ago it's the HUD stuff in it too yeah so I know it's interesting they're probably gonna be pretty shocked at the difference and they go in there but definitely interesting to see other people of your actions Nate it's funny because they they're literally they live in the neighborhood that's close to this and they're saying the kids come here all the time of party and nobody does anything about it so they don't care about the house this house is just being left to be demolished at this point super super shame but you know it's whatever can't do much about it at least the houses here we get to see it before it's completely mangled alright guys thanks so much for watching this explore of this massive event log mansion it was absolutely insane to check out you guys enjoyed if you did don't

on the library shelf a copy of the DSM manual Which is the diagnostic and statistical guide for mental illness. And it contains every mental illness that exists. In the past, in the 1950s, it was a small, thin booklet. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, Now it is a 886-page directory. It currently contains 374 mental illnesses. While I was reading it, I was wondering if you had any mental illness, It turns out that I have twelve of them. (Laughter) I have generalized anxiety disorder, This is necessarily known. I have nightmares disorder, Which is put under classification If you have frequent dreams that you will be pursued or declared to be a failure-- And all my dreams include people chasing me on the street Shouting \"You are a failure\" (Laughter) I have problems with the relationship between parents and the son, Which I blame my father for. (Laughter) I'm joking. I'm not kidding. I'm joking. And I have the disease. And I think it is a rare fact Have disease disease and generalized anxiety disorder, Because disease disease makes me feel very anxious. Whatever it was, I was looking through this book, Wondering if I was more crazy than I expected. Or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose that you have any mental illness If you are not a trainer to work professionally in this field, Or maybe the psychiatrist profession has a strange desire To label what is considered normal human behavior as a psychological disorder. I didn't know which of these two things is correct, But I thought it was a rather interesting idea. And I thought maybe I was supposed to meet a psychiatric critic To get his point. So I ended up at the lunch table with one of the Scientologists. He is a man named Brian He runs a special operations team of Scientologists Determined to fight psychiatry, wherever it is. They call the CCHR So I told him, \"Can you prove it to me Psychiatry is a false science that cannot be trusted? \" He said: \"Yes, we can prove it to you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said: \"We will introduce you to Tony.\" I said, \"Who is Tony?\" He said: \"Tony is on Broadmoor.\" Now, what he means by Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It was known as the \"Broadmoor Sanctuary for Unreasonable Criminals\". There they send serial killers And people who are unable to help themselves. Then I said to Brian, \"What did Tony do?\" He said, \"Hardly anything. Hitting someone or something like that, Then he decided to claim madness to get out of prison. But he claimed madness very well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor No one can believe that he is sane. Would you like us to try and get you to Broadmoor to meet Tony? \" And then I said, \"Yes, please.\" So I took the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn irresistibly at Kempton Park, Apparently, this is what dogs do when they're anxious-- Irresistibly yawning. And we got to Broadmoor. I was taken through a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate To the recovery center Where you can meet patients. It looks like a giant hampton The whole place has peach and pine trees and its colors are comfortable. The only glaring colors are the red color of the emergency button. Patients began to move in. They were a little full and wore cotton sports shorts And they seem easy to comply. Brian whispered Scientology to me, \"They are under the influence of medicine,\" Which is considered to be the worst thing that could happen in the world. But what I thought was probably a good idea. (Laughter) Then Brian said: \"Here's Tony.\" There was a man walking inside. He did not look fat, his body looked very good. He was not wearing these cotton sports pants, He was wearing a striped suit. His arm was outstretched Like a man exited from \"The Apprentice\" He looked like a man wanting to dress up Convince me that he is very sane. Sat down. I said \"So, is it true that you occupied to reach here?\" He said: \"Yes, yes. Of course. I hit someone when I was seventeen. I was in prison awaiting trial, My cellmate told me, Do you know what to do? Call madness. Tell them you're crazy. They will send you to any of the many hospitals. Where the nurses will bring you some pizza. You will own your PlayStation. \" So I said, \"Well, how did you do that?\" He said, \"I asked to see a prison psychiatrist. And you've watched a movie called \"Crash\" Where people get sexual pleasure by bumping cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \"I get sexual pleasure from bumping cars into walls.\" So I said, \"And what else?\" He said, \"Oh, yes. I told the psychiatrist I want to see women die Because it makes me feel normal. \u201d So I said, \"Where did you get that from?\" He said, \"Oh, from Ted Pandey's autobiography That they had in the prison library. \" In any case, he claimed the disease very well as he put it They did not send him to Wathira Hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the moment he got to this place, He said he took one look at the place, asked to see a psychiatrist, He said: \"There has been a terrible misunderstanding. I am not mentally ill. \" I said, \"How long have you been here?\" He said, \"Well, if I had implemented the sentence I was sentenced to imprisonment for my original crime, I would have taken five years. I've been to Broadmoor for 12 years. \" Tony said it is very difficult to convince people that you are sane To convince them that you are crazy. He said: \"I thought it was the best way to look natural You may be by talking to people naturally about natural topics Like football or what is shown on TV. I am subscribed to \"New Scientist\", And recently it had an article How the American army was training hummingbirds to smell explosives. So I said to one of the nurses, \"Do you know that the US Army trains hummingbirds? To sniff out explosives? \" When I read the medical notes written about me, I found that they wrote: \"It is believed that bees can sniff out explosives.\" He said, \"You know, they are always looking for Non-verbal signs of my mental condition. But how do you sit sane? How to put a leg on the other in a rational way? It is impossible. \" And when Tony said that to me, I thought, \"Am I sitting like a journalist? Should I put one leg over another like a journalist? \" He said, \"You know, on the one hand, I have the tendencies of a serial killer like Stockwell Strangler The \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" usurper is on the other side. So I tend to sit in my room a lot because I find them terrifying. They consider sitting for a long time in the room as a sign of madness. They say that this proves that I am lonely and arrogant. \" So, only in Bordmore, the unwillingness to go out and walk around with the serial killers It is a sign of madness. Anyway, it seemed completely normal to me. However, what do I know? When I got home, I sent an email to his doctor, Anthony Madden. I said, \"What is the story?\" He said: \"Yes. We accept that Tony claimed the story of madness to get out of prison Because of his hallucinations, which seemed vulgar to start with Which disappeared the moment Broadmoor entered. However, we have evaluated it. We have decided that what he is is that he is upset. \" And in fact, fake the madness It is precisely the kind of cunning and manipulative behavior of the disordered. She is on the list; cunning and manipulative. So claiming that your mind has something wrong It is evidence that your mind already has something wrong. I talked to other experts, They have said that the striped suit - a classic disordered mind. Speaking of points one and two in the list of symptoms; Sweet-spoken, superficial personality charm and a transcendent sense of self-worth. I said, \"Well, he didn't want to mix with other patients?\" Classical disordered, this is evidence of great feeling as well as a lack of sympathy for others. Hence, all things that looked more natural in Tony It was evidence, according to his doctors, However, he was ill in this new way. He was disturbed. His doctor told me, If you wanted to know more about psychopaths, You can go to the Psychopathology Training Course Run by Robert Hare, the man who invented a list of psychopathic symptoms. And that's what I did I went to a psychopathic discovery course, And now I'm certified-- And I must say, I am very skilled-- As a discoverer of psychopaths. Here are the statistics: One in every hundred ordinary people is psychopathic. Well, there are 1,500 people in this room. Fifteen of you are psychopathic. Note that this number increases to 4 percent From executives and businessmen. So I think there is a very good opportunity There would be 30 or 40 psychopathies in this room. A massacre could happen at the end of this night. (Laughter) (laughter) So Herr said that capitalism is at its extreme Rewards psychopathic behavior-- Lack of sympathy for others, sweet talk, Sly, disingenuous. In fact, capitalism is in its cruelest brutality, It is a physical embodiment of psychopathology. It is like the type of psychopathic That is affecting all of us. Hare said to me: \"You know what? Forget this person in Broadmoor And who may, or may not be a paranoia. who cares? This is not an important story. The important story, he says, is \"they are psychopathic companies.\" You need to interview some psychopath companies. \" So I made an attempt. I addressed people at Enron. I said, \"Can I have an interview with you in prison To find out if you are psychopathic? \" They did not respond to me. So I changed the tactic this time. I sent an email to Dunlap \"Electric Saw\" Originated since the 1990s. He was involved in companies that fell and cut 30 percent of the workforce Simply referring entire American towns to ghost towns. I sent an email to him and said: \"I think you have a very rare brain defect That makes you special And interested in predatory spirit and not to fear anything. Can I do an interview with you? About your rare brain defect? \u200b\u200b\" He said: \"Come.\" Then, I went to the great Dunlap Palace in Florida Which was filled with sculptures of predators. There were lions and tigers. He was taking me through the garden. There were falcons and eagles. He used to tell me: \"There are sharks.\" He was saying this in a less sinister way. \"There are also more sharks and more tigers.\" It was like the Kingdom of Narnia. (Laughter) Then we entered his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlop was being brought in to rescue the companies that went bankrupt. He was laying off 30 percent of the workforce. And he would often fire people from joke, For example, one of the most famous stories about him, Someone came to him and said, \"I just bought a new car.\" He replied, \"Maybe you have a new car, But let me tell you what you don't have, job. \" Well, in his kitchen, he was standing there with his wife Judy And his bodyguard Sean. I told him, \"I remember how I told you in the email Could there be a rare defect in your brain that makes you unique? \" He said: \"Yes, it is an amazing theory. It's like Star Trek. You go where no one has seen you before. \" I said, \"Well, some psychologists might say This makes you ... \"(grunts) (Laughter) He said \"What?\" I said \"psychopathic.\" And then I said, \"I have a full list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I pass it on with you? \" And he seemed very interested against his will, And he said \"Okay, go ahead.\" I said, \"Okay, a transcendent sense of self-worth.\" And what I have to say is that it was difficult to deny it Because he was standing under a giant oil painting drawn to his person. (Laughter) He said, \"Well, you have to believe in yourself!\" I said \"manipulative.\" He said \"This is the leadership.\" I said \"shallow expressions: Inability to express the extent of feelings. \" He said, \"Who wants to be burdened with some trivial feelings?\" So, he was passing the points on the psychopathic list Mainly turning it into \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" (Laughter) But I noticed something that happened to me on the day I spent with the Dunlap. Whenever he told me something he looked normal For example, he answered \"No\" to juvenile delinquency. He said he was accepted to West Point, They do not accept people with a history of events at West Point. And none answered in short marital relations. He only got married twice in his life. Acknowledging that his wife mentioned in her divorce papers He once threatened her with a knife. He said that as long as he wondered what the taste of human flesh is, But people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages at the height of verbal quarrels His second marriage lasted for 41 years. So, whenever he tells me about something that might seem non-psychopathic, I say to myself, well I won't put this in my book. Then I realized that by being a psychopath observer It has turned me a little into psychopaths. Because I was striving to squeeze it into a box that reads psychopathic I was striving to know him as crazy as possible. Then I realized, my God. This is what I have been doing for 20 years. This is what all journalists do. We travel around the world with our paper notes in our hands And we are waiting for jewelry. And jewelry is always a ceiling In the characters we meet. And we sew them together like medieval monks. We leave natural things on the ground. This is one of the countries that diagnoses many mental illnesses far more than the reality. Bipolar disorder in children - children four years old They are classified as bipolar disorder Because they have tantrums, Which makes them score high on the list of bipolar disorder. When I returned to London, Tony phoned me. He said, \"Why didn't you answer my calls?\" I said, \"Well, they say you are psychopathic.\" He replied, \"I am not psychopathic.\" He said \"Do you know what? One of the paragraphs in the list is the lack of remorse, While the other one on the list is furtive, manipulative. When you say that you regret your crime, They say; exactly like psychopathy Cunningly claiming that he feels remorse while he is not. \" It's like magic. They turn everything upside down. He said \"I have a trial soon. Can you come to it? \" I said well Then I went to trial After 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go out. They decided that he was not supposed to be held indefinitely Because its high scores on a list Which could mean that he has above-average chances of a reversal. So they let him go out. And outside in the hallway he told me, \"Do you know what, John? \"All people are somewhat psychopathic.\" He said \"You. I. Well, obviously I am.\" I said \"What are you going to do now?\" He said: \"I will go to Belgium Because there is a woman there I dream about. But she is married, so I will make her separate from her husband. (Laughter) Whatever it was, this was two years ago, And here is where my book ended. In the last 20 months, everything was fine. No bad thing happened. He lived with a girl outside London. It was, according to Brian the Scientologist, It replaces the past time - which I know looks sinister, But it is not necessarily doomed. Unfortunately, after 20 months, He returned to prison for a month. He got into a fight in a bar, as he called it-- Which ended up going to prison for a month, Which I know is bad, But it is at least one month that means whatever quarrel, It was not so bad. Then call me on the phone. Do you know what? I think it is right for Tony to be outside. Because we are not supposed to know people about their craziest limits. And what Tony is on is that he's semi-psychopathic. It is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find complexity, Where you find humanity And where you find the truth. Tony told me, John, can I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. \" I did not go. If you were me, what would you do? Thank you (clap)", "AFKG5r3qNIM": "what's up YouTube why don't when t6 here I wanted to show you my 2017 cargo trailer that I purchased to specifically turn into a camper so I went with the interstate

conditioner run through the inverter if I want it to right now it's currently set up for a short power it takes just a second to change [Music] let's go in  rv-style door okay so that's what it looks like as you're entering the camper Stainmaster flooring there's that forty gallon water tank and I've got a 12 12 volt pump and a pressure accumulator on it there is the propane leak detector I had

batteries are at thirteen point three volts and bringing in eighteen point seven votes right now from the Sun and that controls my water pump my inverter switch  the main interior light switch there again all the lights are LED on the inside and you can individually control them alright so making my way around so the water tank is actually stored underneath this section I didn't want to waste this space so I built just Chester drawers above it so they're all pretty deep this section here is the pantry [Music]  plenty of room in there actually a little kind of more than enough but it was their countertop space and then this is our charge station 12 volt 110 keep all of our devices in there while they're charging okay so my entertainment system that is a 32 inch LED TV blu-ray and Xbox would live up here if we're hitting the road for a little while [Music]  and stepping back ok queen-size bed turns into a couch so this section slides in and the bed actually tilts up on the wall to led reading lamps on both sides and that's a full/queen with a 6-inch memory foam mattress and up top is a full twin size bed 4 inch memory foam mattress and that's my daughter's buck she's got our own space in there and then this curtain install the curtain curtain rod just slides back so she has her privacy  okay there's another window a deep stainless steel sink more countertop space okay down below that's where the trash can lives this is for civil we're kind of disorganized right now very deep drawer okay so refrigerator [Music] the Dometic dual zone refrigerator it runs off a 12 volt and 110 I bought it because it will the solar that I have on the roof will power the the refrigerator so there's no it costs nothing to run it's very efficient it'll freeze the negative 10 and

want this would be this is a turn-on to 110 this is the 12 volt power source and then this is the furnace master so I can shut the furnace off all the power to the furnace off and more another what it's not use carbon monoxide detector King Jack power antenna you can adjust it here it's got an annunciator to take how much signal  go slow so don't make you sick Dometic brisk to 13,500 BTU BTU air conditioner pull this place off in just a split second okay  turn around here bathroom so whenever I first installed this or built it I had a door here that swung to the inside it got in the way replace it with a accordion style door works out perfect so no black water or gray water in this camper except what's built-in there's a black water built into the Porta Potty and I'd like to eventually upgrade to a  looking nature's own or nature secure whatever it's called there's a 110 outlet and an instant hot water heater it runs off LP as a disclaimer I don't condone this on the inside of a enclosed area it's not installed as for manufacturers guidelines don't do it do it at your own risk that being said it works out perfect for me how I have it that's my personal opinion right above it I have a fantastic fan three speeds with the thermostat and whatever get ready to take a shower which is about the only time it's used other than washing dishes open the windows in the back and turn on the fantastic fan and it turns this camper into a vortex shower okay from a shower I have a delta 32 by 34 shower it's a real shower it's built high quality and install a camper style false it in inside the shower and then I put an oxygen X showerhead in order to conserve energy or to conserve water sorry all Lots in here powered by this switch made into the wall and there is my section for towels [Music]  [Music] that's it my 2017 cargo trailer built all parts were brand new this was just a standard cargo trailer with just interior plywood on the walls nothing else when I purchased it it's taken a while but I really liked it I took it to the Catskills fully loaded it weighs in at 4,400 pounds and 580 pounds on the tongue so nice weight very nicely distributed and that does include my battery bank which is in the garage section in the back which I have approximately 325 of amp-hours cool so if you liked the video please click the like button and subscribe my videos have been slow here lately so I want to try to try to work on that but anyway leave me a comment let me some feedback and I appreciate it later", "oMm0-6UAVpE": "From creepy creatures in the mountains to alien hieroglyphics, here are 10 of the most mysterious things found in Russia\u2026. 10. Creature in a Diamond Mine In 2016, miners in Siberia found something truly bizarre while they were digging in the sand. Described by some as a mummified demon spawn, it\u2019s not entirely clear what creature it is. With the age of the region, could it be a dinosaur? Or, perhaps, a more recent creature like a sable or a pine marten (members of the weasel family)? It was found in the Mirninsky district of the Sakha Republic, in a region known for the large number of diamonds that can be found there. The sands have been dated to the Mesozoic era, more than 66 million years ago, and pretty often reveal ancient fossils and things, but no one knew quite what to make of this particular discovery. They think it could be some type of mummified mammal even like a young wolverine. Its small body, and deadly looking skull means it could conceivably be any of those suggestions, but further tests are needed to know for sure. The specimen was taken to the regional capital of Yakutsk to try and understand more but, as of yet, no results have been published. 9. Megalithic Monuments Deep within the Caucasus mountains of Russia, near Sochi, are thousands of strange structures that archaeologists are still struggling to understand, despite having been there for up to 25,000 years. Known as \u201cdolmens\u201d, there\u2019s some dispute as to quite how old they are- but one thing\u2019s for sure, they\u2019re a unique type of architecture that\u2019s seen nowhere else. Like other megaliths, they were built using large rocks that were cut following the natural geometric shapes. Usually there\u2019s a court towards the front that may have been used as a place for rituals, and bronze and iron age pottery has been found littering the sites, which is why they have been able to be dated so far back. New dolmens are found all the time, and there are at least 3,000 that are known of- usually in clusters of tens or hundreds. No human remains have been found in them, so it\u2019s unlikely that they were being used as tombs, but the mystery continues and is one of the most prevailing unanswered questions that Russian researchers have yet to solve. 8. Giant Craters These next discoveries have only just started to appear in recent years, and are thought to be some of the first noticeable signs that global warming is having a damaging impact on world, starting with the Russian landscape. In 2014, three gigantic craters were found in Siberia, with some as large as 250 feet (76.2m) in diameter! One of them, on the Yamal peninsula, was then seen to be surrounded by 20 smaller craters, all full with water, within a year of the original one appearing. As each year passes, more of these holes are being picked up by satellite imagery of the area, which is now intently looking for more evidence of why this is happening. Craters are everywhere and the landscape is falling apart! The size and immediacy of these craters suggest that some explosive force might be to blame. The leading theory is that, as temperatures in the land are rising, large amounts of gas hydrates are being released and start exploding through the softened ground. The craters are beginning to have a detrimental effect on the region, with wildlife suffering the most. The tundra, is literally starting to thaw!! Herd animals better watch out as they migrate across. If it continues to happen, measures will have to be taken to try and prevent its spread, or risk losing the landscape for good. And now for one of the most mysterious events of all time!! But first be sure to subscribe and click on the notification bell!! 7. Dyatlov Pass Incident In 1959, mountain rescuers found what would become an enduring mystery in Russia, known as the Dyatlov Pass incident. A few weeks earlier, 9 ski hikers had gone missing while on a trip to reach the Otorten mountain- a route that was, at the time, classified as a category 3- the most difficult. They were all very experienced with this type of expedition and shouldn\u2019t have encountered too many difficulties. Something, though, went terribly wrong. Rescuers first of all, found the tent that had been abandoned and badly damaged and slashed. All of the groups\u2019 belongings and shoes were left inside, but there was no sign of them. It appeared as if the tent had been cut down from the inside, and everyone ran out into the woods in socks or barefoot. Sets of 9 footprints led from the tent to the nearby woods in the snow. Here they found the first two bodies near the remains of a fire. They had attempted to climb up a tree for unknown reasons, but succumbed to the cold. Their bodies lay there, but showed signs of having been moved after they had died. Things got more bizarre when the other bodies were found over the next few days. Three of the final group that were found showed signs of fatal internal injuries- the sort you\u2019d expect from a car crash, but without any external damage. One was missing her tongue, and some of their clothes were found to be radioactive. The story has since become legend in the mountains, but to this day it\u2019s still a complete mystery as to what happened to those unfortunate travellers. 6. Volgograd Discs In 2015, when a group of UFO hunters began excavating a site in the Volgograd region, not even they could have expected to find something so bizarre. In the ground were more than a dozen stone discs. Most of them were about a meter (3.3 feet) in diameter, but there was also one that was twice that size. The shape of these discs have clearly excited UFO theorists because of their similarity to a traditional flying saucer shape, and to add fuel to speculation the team that found them said they were primarily made from Tungsten, a material often used in military applications. The team that discovered the discs have come up with some radical theories about their origin, claiming that they\u2019re more than a million years old and from an alien race. Scientists who have been studying them, though, think there\u2019s a more believable terrestrial reason for them, and think they could be unusual features created by the flow of ice across the landscape. So what do you think? Alien Hieroglyphics or natural markings? 5. Arkaim In 1987 an archaeological team, from the University of Chelyabinsk, uncovered an ancient fortress that dated back to about 2 or 3 thousand years ago. It\u2019s called Arkaim, and is often referred to as the Russian Stonehenge- possibly even pre-dating the structure built by the druids in England. There are two circular walls, all surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall and a moat. Inside there are a series of rectangular shaped structures, thought to be living spaces. A further 35 houses were found outside the main structure, and there was even a sophisticated water and sewage system. Tombs and mines were also discovered, and the entire place would have been meticulously planned before being built- something quite unusual for the time. It looks like Arkaim served as a fortress for its inhabitants for about 200 years, but then they all suddenly left. There are no clues yet as to who these people were, or why they were so advanced compared to other cultures at the time. Some strange phenomenon has been reported at the site, such as magnetic anomalies and unusual weather, but this could have a lot to do with its location. Similar to Stonehenge, Arkaim was purposefully built with the understanding of the movement of the sun in the sky, and would have been used to celebrate the summer and winter solstices. 4. Ancient Flying Saucer In 2015 there was another discovery of a mysterious disc, this time in the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia. Lots of strange activity and alien discs in Russia!! It\u2019s a region known for coal deposits and, during an excavation more than 130 feet underground, they found this flying saucer-shaped rock. It\u2019s almost perfectly circular, weighs about 440 pounds, and is about 4 feet in diameter. What\u2019s more, the excavators actually found two of the objects but the first, unfortunately, was destroyed while they were digging. To give some perspective of how old this object could be, mammoth bones have been found in the area at depths of about 80 feet, so this disc seems to be much, much more ancient. It seems highly unlikely that this is a natural formation, but if it was manmade, what was the purpose of it? There\u2019s very little record of civilisations living in the region, which makes this all the more bizarre. But, with large rock structures being found all over Russia, who knows what else could be lurking deep beneath the ground and ready to be discovered? 3. Creature Near Power Plant This next discovery is the real life version of one of the most famous Simpsons episodes, but far more bizarre than a 3-eyed-fish. In 2015, two residents of Sosnovy Bor were walking along the local river, and found this bizarre body floating in the water. The river was built in the 1950\u2019s to provide water to the Leningrad nuclear power plant, so what kind of creature is this? Initial suggestions pointed towards it being a mutant chicken embryo, but with no neck, wings, and such an elongated head this seems unlikely. It doesn\u2019t, though, resemble any known animal, so DNA swabs were taken to try and understand more about it. Since then, no information has been released about what was found, which has excited alien researchers- some of who think it\u2019s an extra-terrestrial. Despite the more outlandish theories the answer, however, is likely to be far more simple- quite often animals are born with deformities that make them unrecognisable around this river and, with the presence of a nuclear reactor nearby, this is by far the most likely and disturbing explanation. 2. Ancient Microchip Computer chips are a relatively recent invention, right? Well this bizarre discovery has got some people thinking that they aren\u2019t as new as we thought. A fisherman in the Krasnodar region found this peculiar rock and, on it, there appears to be some form of ancient technology that resembles today\u2019s microchips. Tests on the object show it to be embedded in the rock, with some suggestions dating it to as far back as 250 million years- long before humans evolved on our planet. Geologists and other scientists simply cannot explain the creation of this chip, and it certainly isn\u2019t made by natural processes. If it truly is that old, then it would completely change our understanding of the development of life on earth. Of course, it could also be a natural formation of the type not ever seen before, or even something much newer that managed to get itself entombed within the rock somehow. So far nobody knows. 1. Demonic Skulls and Nazi Briefcase Saved the weirdest for last! A team of explorers found a cave on Mount Bolshoi Tjach, and inside were a pair of very odd shaped, demonic looking skulls. To make things even weirder, someone else made another find in the region- a Nazi briefcase with a full German colour map of the Adygea region that had been made in 1941. This briefcase bore the emblem of the Ahnenerbe, a secretive Nazi faction that was tasked with proving the Aryan race once controlled the whole planet. The Nazis were also known for their dealings with the occult, and the links between these two finds haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by some- thinking it\u2019s proof that they made contact with extraterrestrial beings, or managed to summon something deadly from deep within the earth. Or at least they tried. There is a more down to earth explanation for the skulls, which could have been exposed to weathering processes for long periods of time and been misshaped, but there\u2019s still the question of the briefcase, and why the Nazis were so interested in the region during the war.

some seasoning and we're gonna walk you through how to do just that [Music]  welcome to the show and let me introduce you to the cast iron and this is my modern-day Lodge Dutch oven and it is grimy and full of old oil and soot and ash and needs to be cleaned badly but other than it's doing pretty good so I'm gonna use this to demonstrate how to clean cast iron this is another piece of modern Lodge cookware it's a griddle and it's been used and abused to the seasonings all gone and it's covered in rust and it has a lot of damage but no pitting and nothing too serious I'm gonna use this to demonstrate knocking off some loose rust and REE seasoning this skillet was made by lodge a few years ago and it has been used and abused it's doing okay on the inside just need some reasoning but on the back it's got some pretty heavy-duty rust damage so I'm gonna remove the rust and then re season the whole thing this is an unmarked Wagner skillet it's a ten and a half inch skillet from probably around the 1950s and it is in some bad shape it is covered completely and rust with absolutely no seasoning I'm able to tell it's a Wagner because of the font and the lettering it says ten and a half inch skillet and then it has the size number or on it and it's got the size on the top of the handle additionally I can tell it's post 1950s because it's got a smooth bottom but it doesn't say made in the USA on it this is a very old pot it's got a gate mark which is a mark left over from the manufacturing process which puts it probably in the 1800's sometime and it is in really rough shape it has got lots of heavy pitting heavy rust and the inside of it it has an enamel lining that's very damaged and it has about 1/8 inch deep pits all throughout the bottom so this thing is in serious trouble I really don't know if I can save this one but we're gonna try alright guys it's time to get the rust off this cast iron and to do that I'm gonna use three different methods the first method I'm going to use is electrolysis the second method is a vinegar bath and thirdly I'm going to use coca-cola this is my first time using the coca-cola method so I'm going to get a chance to compare it against the vinegar method to make it electrolysis baths all you need is a plastic bin full of water and then you're gonna want to add a fair amount of baking soda in this amount of water I'm putting about an eighth of a cup of baking soda mix it up really good and then get yourself a piece of metal you don't mind ruining in this example I've got a piece of old rebar then I'm gonna take my old pot and I'm gonna sink it down in here and I've got it hanging suspended in the water I don't want it resting on the bottom and I've got it tied with a piece of metal coat hanger in this example now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hook up a battery charger to this and I'm gonna put the positive on the sacrificial anode that you want to ruin and I'm gonna put the negative on the pot that I want the rust to come off of the more amps you run through this the more aggressively it's going to to work you can tell things are starting to work when you'll see bubbles and fizzing the closer you place the sacrificial anode to the base metal the stronger the reaction and so you can effectuate which part you want to focus on based on where you put the anode put the anode here this parts gonna clean the fastest now for this skillet I'm going to use vinegar to get the rust off I'm just gonna put it in this plastic pin here and I've got a gallon of white distilled vinegar that's five percent acidity so was three dollars at the grocery store and we're just gonna pour it on alright we're gonna let that soak for about an hour then we're gonna scrub it and soak it again and scrub it and soak it until it's clean next we're gonna clean these two pieces of cast iron using original coca-cola I've never done this before so I'm just gonna kind of do it like I would vinegar and see how it comes out  [Music]  of these three methods hands-down my favorite for this type of work is the vinegar bath the electrolysis works but it's really fidgety you have all this stuff you need to set up you know this charger and you need to constantly move the anode around to get it evenly across to all the surfaces the vinegar you just dump it in a bucket of vinegar and it seems to work fine the coca-cola works but not as well as the vinegar and it's more expensive there's a lot of products and chemicals out on the market they'll get rid of rust really well and even better than vinegar however I don't know if I want to be putting those chemicals on my cookware and letting it soak for hours at a time the vinegar the coca-cola the electrolysis all it does is loosen the rust it doesn't actually get it off you still have to use some elbow grease to do that you can use a scouring pad at or boy a wire brush a drill an angle grinder whatever helps you can use it I got this little wire adapter at the end of a drill I'm going to use it to try to get the remainder of this rust off and if I can't do it I'll put it back in the vinegar and soak it some more [Music] well you can see what a difference that's already making getting down to bare cast-iron  [Music]  all right well the cast-iron skillets been sitting in the vinegar for another hour and we're gonna see if the more stubborn spots have loosened up [Music]  let's rinse it off in some vinegar and make sure we got everything that's ten and a half inch skillet is looking really good just a few places to touch up and it'll be done  so rinse it off in the vinegar and as you can see it's just all nice and shiny so we are all ready to season this thing  you can see here some of the black spots where the electrolysis has already started to work rust is really coming off right there now restoring this pot is going to be a special kind of challenge it's got this broken enamel lining on the inside and I cannot fix it there's really nothing I could do about that so the best thing to do is try to remove the enamel lining probably the best way to get rid of the enamel lining would be a using glass beads in a sandblaster I do not have that equipment so instead I'm going to use this this stripper here on a power drill and hopefully I can take off the enamel this doesn't work I'm gonna upgrade to an angle grinder and see how that does I'm going to be doing this forever at this speed I'm going to try out the angle grinder and see how well that handles  [Music] well guys I did something stupid hey it was grinding and grinding and grinding away at this enamel and there's an hour into it and you can see how little progress I've made so I thought maybe I could speed this up if I just gently tap it with a ball-peen hammer I can just chip away the enamel and break it off and that would speed up the process and I was being extremely gentle and look at this right there just busted a hole right in the caster and it cracked all over this pot is from the 1800s and I just broke it learn from my mistakes first off don't try to buy antique pots with damaged enamel linings they are a pain in the butt second of all don't try to knock the enamel off with a hammer this is the one that was soaking in the coca-cola let's get the rust off here there's some serious rust on it  this one was really easy only took one soak in the coca-cola and five minutes or so with the English minor and the brush to get it all completely done it wasn't too bad well this griddle is pretty well off so I'm really expecting to do everything quite quickly with just the electric drill [Music]  [Music] well that looks pretty good got the rust off the griddle very easily and now one thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna smooth the surface a little bit now this is a modern-day Lodge cast-iron griddle Lodge deliberately makes their surfaces slightly textured so that it can pre season them that they can and season them quickly and cheaply at the factory so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this little thing right here and I'm gonna go and hit the surface and just take some of that texture off and that will smooth it out [Music]  well this is a whole lot smoother and it's still a few pits in here and grooves so there's places for the oil to to bake on in but he'll take fewer layers of seasoning for this to become really excellent nonstick once you remove all the rust the exposed iron is really susceptible to rusting and corrosion and you can happen in a matter of hours so ideally you want to season your cast iron immediately after removing the rust that's not realistic for me today I ran out of time and it's gonna be a couple days before I pick this project up again so I'm gonna leave all this cast iron sitting in this vinegar submerged and I'll pick it up again in a couple days and it'll have no corrosion on it look at that just a couple days ago it was solid rust now it's bare cast iron now we need to clean off the caster and get all that dirt and grime and metal shavings off the cast iron now we're gonna do this using soap and water now I know some of you out there thinking oh no you never never use soap and water to clean cast iron that's not true you don't use soap and water to clean seasoned cast iron so at this point we want to get as clean as possible soap is the appropriate thing to do once it's seasoned don't use soap and you want to get the water as hot as possible here if you want to know if you did a good job take a white paper towel hang it down the towel comes back relatively clean looking you did a good job and the towel comes back black you know you still have some scrubbing to do once you've got it nice and clean towel dry the cast iron and put it in the of it we're just gonna put it in the oven long enough to make sure it's bone-dry [Music] gotta admit that's impressive transformation that thing looks good if you have a piece of cast iron that's only lightly rusted you can get rid of the rust simply with soap water and a bit of elbow grease all the electric drills and angle grinders and vinegar isn't necessary for things that just got a little bit a fairly new rust off [Music] alright so I've got the cast iron clean I've got it scrubbed washed bone-dry and a little bit warm now it's time to apply the oil to begin seasoning it now I'm going to use organic flaxseed oil with no preservatives in it this is just some of the best stuff you can use to seasoned cast iron but you can also use vegetable shortening that you've melted down you can use canola oil some people use coconut oil there's a lot of different things you can use for seasoning one of the most popular ways to season cast iron is to take shortening and wipe it onto a hot piece of cast iron it melts right in and after you've covered every square inch of it with shortening then you take a clean towel and you wipe off all the excess put the cast iron in an oven at 400 degrees for about an hour and then repeat the process two to four times to build up a layer of seasoning now this will get the cast iron darker than flaxseed oil but I prefer flaxseed oil because it's stronger so let me show you how to season it with flaxseed oil coat the warm cast iron in flaxseed oil just like you would shortening and wipe off the excess with a clean towel now we're gonna put it upside down so the oil can drip off alright we're gonna bake it in there for one hour at 400 degrees Fahrenheit  no matter what type of oil you're using to season your castor and make sure you don't put too much on it after you apply the oil wipe off the excess with the dry clean towel if you flirt with the oil cast iron in the oven it puts off a fair amount of smoke especially you need to do three items at once so got the fan blow and smoke out and I've got the fan hood going full-throttle it was still a little smoking here but after about 15 minutes it cleared up pretty good so heads up don't do it when your wife's at home  so you notice how the seasoning on this old skillet is kind of splotchy but the modern-day large skillet it's not that's because of how these skillets are designed modern skillets are kind of bumpy so that they can be pre seasoned very quickly at the factory it takes a lot less time and energy to preseason a slightly bumpy surface the old skillets are smooth time for layer number two but again we're doing it for 400 degrees for one hour [Music] so there we go we've got two layers it's looking a little darker so there's the skillet is only the second layer and it should be very smooth to the touch it shouldn't be sticky at all if your pan is sticky that means you haven't cooked it long enough or you've added too much oil or both here's the the lodge pan you can see it's coming along very nice you can see what the griddle looks like after three layers of seasoning well it's hard it's not sticky at all it doesn't have a greasy feel to it so you can see what the skillet looks like after three layers pretty darn good but still it's more Brown than black so you can see the modern large skillet this is looking really dark it grabs that seasoning better than the smoother older skillets but it's bumpier it's not quite as smooth so here I am on my last layer of seasoning and the pots and pans skillets aren't quite black yet so I'm putting them in for a number of hours until they just turn black and this is just a way of finishing up the seasoning and making sure that thick layer of seasoning is cooked all the way through yeah check that out I didn't add any more oil to it but just a little bit more time in the oven and it turned perfectly shiny black that is gorgeous all right we're gonna do a little bit of troubleshooting here so I'm gonna demonstrate two common mistakes and then show you how to fix them the first is doing too many layers two to four layers is fine six to seven layers isn't necessarily better additionally adding more oil on each layer isn't better so here I am I'm just slopping the oil on as much as I can get on here and I'm gonna cook it in for a total of six layers on all the cast iron here and I'm gonna show you what it does and how to identify it and how to fix it if your layers of seasoning come out bumpy and uneven this is a sign that you're using too much oil you're not wiping off the excess when you turn it upside down the drips of oil are hardening you'll see them along the edge of the skillet especially and they'll break off and expose cast iron and cause weaknesses in your seasoning if you add too many layers of seasoning you'll start to get this bumpy surface that is it as nonstick as it should be you can remove these bumps and blisters through sandy removing the bumps in your seasoning doesn't take a lot of effort so you can sand by hand very easily or use a random orbital sander use 800 to a thousand grit sandpaper and just make a few passes until it's smooth to the touch alright just rinse it off scrub it without using any soap  [Music] now the fun part guys I'm going to show you how to cook with cast iron alright we're going to put this on a medium heat for about five minutes we're gonna let that pan absorb all that ki that's the beauty of cast iron is it absorbs a lot of heat and distributes it very evenly  with no one Catherine fans you are constantly moving the food around with cast iron don't do that stick the meat down and let it sit there until the surface caramelizing then it will release and unstick you can move it yes caramelized just releases  [Music]  once you sear the outside of the steaks turn the heat way down to low then we're gonna slow cook it I'm gonna put some of this Montreal steak seasoning on there I like my steaks to be medium-rare but if you like to cook yours a little bit more thoroughly one of the nice things about cast iron is you can take it and just put it right into the oven and that helps cook the steaks nice and even after you've caramelized the outside and seared in those juices  beautiful steaks beautiful now we're gonna cook the vegetables little olive oil just a dash and I'm gonna roll this asparagus around so it's getting the beef juice and the olive oil all mixed up you want all the asparagus coated sprinkle them with some garlic salt make sure you don't overcook the asparagus it should Bend but it should still be able to snap if it's floppy you've overdid it  [Music]  all I'm gonna do is just black in the pepper a little bit and sprinkle a little bit of salt on them guys there you go you can see you got a little bit of black on the pepper you're good to go you don't want to overdo already got my dirty cast iron skillet here from lunch and all I'm gonna do is just wash it in warm water and scrub it with a scrub brush don't overthink it and don't use soap the trickiest part about cleaning a cast iron skillet is it's hard to see if there's any gunk or residue stuck to it because it's a black you know cast iron let's just use your fingers really quick make sure you don't feel anything stuck to it you're good to go and dry it off really good with the towel all right they're nice and clean dried didn't take you long you don't want to use metal tools like spatulas and tongs and forks too aggressively when using cast iron they can scrape off the seasoning and that's what you see here these scratch marks from a pair of metal tongs it's time to clean this pot you can see here it's got tons of grease and soot and all sorts of nasty stuff in there and even this this is old oil I think I was making some campfire Donuts and I didn't clean this thing out heating up the cast iron can make cleaning it a little bit easier you know I still want to be able to handle it but I want to make it pretty hot to the touch [Music] water is good for removing a suit and burnt up food but if you try to get grease off often the dry paper towel does better than the scrub brush and water  [Music] there we go it's all cleaned all right that's how you restore season cook with and clean cast iron so not the only way to do it but it's how I do it and hopefully it'll get you started and you learn something new well thanks for

the mysteries of the speed square I emphasize how important of a tool this is to have in your tool belt it's so important that I actually have a backup and it's not a great one but it's a spare just in case something happens so whether you're the cut man whether you're the layout man whether you're the guy installing you need to check whether stuff is Square to your plates you got to have one of these in your belts and if you don't you're almost worthless in fact if you only had these four items in your tool belt you could do most carpentry jobs no problem hammer pencil tape measure speed square well and now see next in order I would go utility knife a chalk line the must that's off and so let's start with the things that people do know about a speed square most commonly okay number one is you can hook it on a board like that pull it tight and you can make a perpendicular line to the board and you can cut it that's number one the second thing that most people already know is that it has a tape measure on it so say I wanted to mark a stud layout I would put that on that mark and Mark an inch and a half and draw another line and there's a stud layout boom most people know that it's also a new accident that a speed square measure is about seven inches across the top in fact I hear more about seven and eight that's because two by fours are three and a half inches fine across two of them is seven inches if they're spaced out a little bit like they are here seven and an eight when you're doing your layout so you're doing 16 on the center we're gonna mark three quarters either side a 16 inch increments stud and I want to lay this out across both plates and actually you want to make sure the ends of your plates are flush like that before you do that and so strike our lines for our layout now we'll go all the way across nice and easy with our seven inch speed square okay so let's dive into number one of lesser known things that this speed square will do number one on that list would be the scribe feature on a speed square now these little notches right here are indicator marks for eighth inches on your square tape measure so we're gonna pick the one that's an inch and a half which would be right there and if you hold your square tight and pull it like that you will get a line that is exactly an inch and a half from this edge of the board so these things also make awesome throwing stars do you think you're in ninja get start with one of these don't mess with the man with the speed squared okay we're gonna look at measuring degrees with your speed square this has a pivot point which is this corner right here usually has a little a little notch in it a little see that little notch missing that's your that's your pivot point we're gonna hook that on the edge of the board and we will spin the square out and if you want to pick a degree we're gonna pick 40 degrees right there see that 40 degrees you'll line it up with this edge of the board same edge as your pivot point except on and you can now draw a line and that's a 40 degree line in relation to this edge of the board now let's get into some rafter cuts with this speed square using this pivot point the same as we did before let's turn this out here to where it says six on the common and say common top cuts and this would be the say the top end of a rafter where it butts into the girder and so this would be a six on 12 pitch so we're gonna mark that and that would be cut right here and that would make the top edge of your rafter that's your common top cuts now we're gonna pretend that this rafter needs to be cut on a 10 12 so we're gonna do the same thing pivot till we see 10 on your common right here and we're gonna draw the line keeping this pivot tight and that is a 10 12 top cut on your common scale and of course if you want a 45 degree angle or a 12 12 pitch would be the same thing you just hook this thing flat and Mark the long edge and that's a 45 degree angle and that's a 1012  now we're gonna look at this hip valley top cut scale right here now this is for the top end of a hip rafter and so what we're doing right now would be this top cut where it butts in to whatever it butts into okay so for the hip Valley cuts it works much in the same way you're gonna rotate on this pivot point and if we have a 1012 common rafter we're going to go to the 1012 on the hip Valley and that's gonna make the top cut for our hip Valley rafter described that line of course you just have to extend it on out to the end of the board this works well for that as well and now you can cut that and that's the right angle for your top cut on your hip Valley this dotted line right here is used to do your seat cuts which also called a bird mouth and that's where your rafter sits on top of a wall plate and so let's do a mock up here let's pretend the rafter tail is this end of the board and I know the measurement to the outside of the wall plate on the bottom edge of this rafter so I'm gonna mark that point and say this is a 712 pitch rafter so we're gonna mark on seven and I've drawn a line here and it can be long it doesn't matter and that's the vertical line of this bird's mouth when we're setting the rafter now we're going to use this seat cut feature we're going to line up this dotted line with the line we just made you can see how that lines up and make a line back across here now that's a bird's mouth for a 712 pitch on a three and a half inch wall and actually your wall plate is going to be right there so another way I commonly use my speed square is to flush boards on top or bottom and that would be using it in this manner to make sure I'm gonna depend on nail to boards together if they're flush and not slightly offset like that bump he'll fight nail it speed square board you don't have to draw a line just give yourself a nice straight edge looks good you're square to run the base of your saw on it make sure your fingers are out the way guys don't hold your square like this hold it way out here and that's actually the better place to hold it in anyway do not hold it there right here fingers way away sometimes you have to remember the measurements of a lot of boards and then walk to a cut station cut them that's when the speed square comes into play if I need to cut a bore 101 and a half I'll just write it on here I need one 102 and 8 I write it on here and when you're done with them little lick and they're gone ready to go again so that's a really uncommon use but I do that all the time so don't forget stuff between where I'm working in the cut station okay so I know that my speed square is 3/16 of an inch that if I'm studying windows or doing something where I know I need a three sixteenths Jim I also use it for that that's great for that [Music] and if you guys are real smart you'll ignore everything I just said and look at the booklet that comes with your speed square but that requires reading and watching videos is way more fun [Music]", "zt6gCyHrF04": "it's the 13 biggest houses until ax is the name of a giant futuristic mansion in Mumbai India and is the first billion-dollar residential

it's not in use so it hardly adds any weight to what you would normally carry on a hike desalination is a simple process when salt water is boiled the water evaporates into steam leaving the salt behind if we can collect the steam and condense it back into liquid water it will be absolutely pure this is actually a small problem because drinking water with no minerals in it at all can be harmful to your health by depleting your electrolytes but that issue is easily solved as I'll demonstrate later this video is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club the first item required for this project is a stainless steel bottle some bottles like this have a double wall to insulate the contents but for this project we just want a simple non insulating bottle with a steel lid the condenser portion of the desalinator will be made from 1/4 inch copper tubing so to attach it to the bottle I first had to learn how to solder copper to stainless steel I practiced this on a stainless steel bowl and it's a good thing I did because my first attempts were not great I learned that it's important to clean both the copper and stainless steel with a bit of sandpaper before soldering and the process requires a generous amount of flux applied to the joint beforehand since this will be in contact with drinking water it's important to use lead-free plumbing solder not the stuff made for electronics my best results used only very gentle heat from my torch just barely getting the metal hot enough to melt the solder until it joined the two pieces a spritz of rubbing alcohol from a spray bottle cleans up the excess flux and you can see how much I improved from my first attempt to my last now that I'm prepared to work on the real bottle the first step is to remove the lid and any gasket that makes a seal this is set aside for now so it doesn't get damaged the lid now needs a hole drilled all the way through it to accommodate a piece of copper tubing one of the first tools I ever wanted when I was a kid was a drill press to make this sort of task easy but you could also get this done with a hand drill I also made a tiny hole near the edge of the lid so the air will be able to escape from inside as I heat it with the torch I'll plug this later after preparing the surface around these holes with sandpaper a bit of copper tubing is pushed through them enough to stick out about half an inch from both sides then I just soldered the tube in place following the process I learned earlier both on the top and bottom of the lid the tiny hole I made to release air pressure was small enough that I could just use a soldering iron instead of a torch but the process of sanding then adding plenty of flux around a tiny piece of solder worked the same way with this part completed the silicone gasket can be reinstalled in the lid and the whole thing screwed back on to the bottle the short section of coppers sticking out of the top will connect to a longer piece of tubing using a right-angle compression fitting which can be pressed into the lid and tightened down to lock it on the other end the little piece sticking out can be removed it's not really needed for copper tubing anyway instead I take a little piece of rubber and press it into the lock nut before screwing it back onto the fitting this will make an airtight seal when the design is being used as a water bottle and to use the desalination feature you simply pop the rubber piece out first now the 1/4 inch copper tubing I have used so far in this project is sold in large coils for use as water lines leading to a refrigerator or freezer to form my coil for the desalinator I simply take this tubing and start wrapping it tightly around the bottle I found that 8 or 9 turns looked pretty good and that should be plenty of tubing to Rican dents the steam when we boil water inside the bottle I decided to bend the ends of the coil outward so that when one end is pressed into the fitting on the bottle the other side will be sticking straight out as fresh water drips from this end we want it to be easy to collect and that's it now we just need to give this project a try  after removing the rubber seal from the fitting the coil slips right off the bottle and presses back into the fitting with only a small amount of force this bottle has a ring built into the lid which makes it really easy to hang from a hook or piece of string which is good since we need to suspend this bottle over a fire I have in this beaker some saltwater equivalent in salinity to ocean water you can tell just how much salt is in this by the residue it leaves behind when it boils this is what we will aim to remove with the desalinator the salt water is added to my bottle and then reattach to the lid which is now hanging over a heat source in this case my small soup can stove [Music] this little stove I made in an earlier video and it's great for cooking over but in this case it was a cold windy day and it was too much to ask of such a small stove to keep water boiling in a bottle when the wind kept blowing the flames out from under it when there were breaks in the wind I did start to see some water production but to speed things along I switched in a larger coffee can stove this worked much better you could of course just use an open campfire to heat this bottle a stove just makes things easier this time the stove was actually so hot that the steam production outpaced the rate that the coil could cool it back down into water we can see drips forming but also quite a bit of steam exiting the tubing this is wasteful so we need to cool the tubing down until we're only seeing liquid water coming from the end an improvised way to do this is with a piece of fabric if you were hiking this could be the shirt off your back we wet this with cold saltwater and wrap it around the coil this will need to be wet again with cold water regularly as the coil heats it up but doing so will greatly improve freshwater production an even more efficient method if you have an extra container is to dip the whole bottom half of the coil into water this works so well that all of the steam will stop flowing and it will seem like water production has stopped but in a few moments water will have filled the coil and resumed pouring out of the end with this setup you will end up with almost all of the water you started with free of salt one final efficiency tip is that once you have built up enough water in your collection container the end of the tubing can be dipped into it and in that way your freshwater itself will act as a condenser for any steam that exits the tubing it's good to stop boiling the salt water in the desalinator before it runs completely dry or you'll end up with a hardened mineral cake lining the inside I started with about 250 milliliters of saltwater I ended with about 175 of distilled water now as I mentioned at the start of this video it's unhealthy to drink pure distilled water so the desalinator is cracked back open and before drinking the fresh water just a small splash of the concentrated salt solution added back in just a few drops is fine the rest should be poured out now thus water is perfectly safe to drink and if ocean water is all you have it could very well save your life this is what the water now looks like being poured out on a burner this time with much less salt you might wonder if this desalinator would work with solar power like a fern L lens or parabolic mirror definitely it could be used with either of those heat sources which I may experiment with later for best results with solar the bottle should be painted black for maximum light absorption and as you can see this happens automatically the first time you use it over a wood fire Dollar

backsplash new look so we're changing the countertops up a bit I'm you can see we already rolled out the primer you've probably seen this rollout primer a hundred times we didn't show that but we're gonna we're gonna show you the rest of the process we're going to do a new cool look we're in the past we only did this on a sample board and made a video so now we're gonna do it on an entire kitchen so enjoy  I saw RDD shed of the roller like we saw you guys let's wrap some tape on it this is gonna get all the loose hairs off right now I'm just applying a little bit of pressure and using this as a squeegee  [Music]  nice know what something out rolling over the head just yet just spread it out across the top  [Music]  I don't like to get right up to the edge without going over kind of leave with a little feed there  [Music]  now I'll just run it right to the eggs do section at a time and then then roll the face of it roll the top a little roll the face  and you can see our catch basin here so we don't get drips on there the lower countertop will start dripping once I get these edges  I know is that easy I know we could die  you said you've all  [Music]  [Music] I so you see we got the top done with the base color we swirled it that helps pop the bubbles and I'm going to have two highlights and with this technique we're just gonna drizzle it all random ways with the white and we'll come back with that with the black you want to try to get on your edges too it's a really easy technique to do look awesome in your dock like I said just make sure you get up to your edges so you're headed don't look bare when you're done  pays me water  [Music]  I don't other reasons by far really  guys can see how I'm basically out of material definitely don't want to cut it that close so just get a lot on your counters everywhere and then you can always go back and add some  do the same thing in between all the white ones try to go right over the white lines remember you're going random way you go across it'll really matter just don't look for line right over the white  [Music]  I know is that easy I know it  you said you've all  [Music]  you don't want to run out try to feel like I did on both these highlight colors make sure you get color on all your counters before you get low all right I'm gonna take my paintbrush I kind of dipped it in the stuff on the floor got a saturate in the middle now I'm just gonna blend these colors random ways and it just like crisscross patterns and once these roller brush lights go away it's gonna look awesome  just real light you're not trying to move a lot of the material around hit your edges as you go just still probably have to message your head is a little bit after after you're done doing the top  we're not living in a lot I'm just hitting it real quick-like  try to use a decent sized brush when you're doing this don't you in a really small brush  hi guys this is after we're done at the top the edges and see how get those edges look we didn't even really have to hit them did you pour that material right to the edge to highlight colors right to the edge and they just kept flowing over Joe Austin it turned out Gregg's just escaping this the drips now periodically every 20 minutes I'm just going to scrape the drips and we'll come back tomorrow do that do the top coat welcome back guys it's the next day you see how awesome these counters turned out the cool thing about our top coats is they don't really drip so we're taking all the plastic off and just write a new Fresh Beat of tape across the tiles there's just some stuff we didn't want to get a top coat on they remember we coated these counters well two years ago and he remodeled the kitchen did cabinets got new appliances put up some crown molding did a bunch of work in there and he called this up wanted to redo these so he went from a white counter now he's got gray and they just look awesome so I'm just gonna dip and roll this top coat like like they do every time get it nice and saturated  remember this stuff goes a long way I  like to roll down the middle crossbow let's spread it out and just try to do short manageable sections because this stuff starts setting up once you start rolling it out you got plenty of working time minutes in the bucket or the roller tray once you start rolling it out start setting up  nice leaving so  the whole section  we're gonna have the metal piece angling towards the direction you're gonna go you're just gonna lightly roll this back back roll slightly roll it out overlapping this is gonna help minimize any roller lines  [Music] a little bit more here  just look as you guys are going you can tell where my me  and we send out more than you guys need so you're probably going to not be using all of this don't don't think you got to use it all know you want this on a spin and you can get it [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  one of the easiest top coats to a black on the market given the fact that you can dip and roll it and get a lot of working time with it we'll just do the same thing it's like the finish it out overlap it a little  [Music]  [Music] really light you have to do it small sections I'm not trying to do this whole top or this whole bottom layer do a manageable section that's gonna keep them all alive  [Music]  so now that we're dead I'm gonna pull this blue tape on and the job site is pretty much cleaned out having a clean case like this just makes it so much easier to pull off you don't got a pop star to it  just try not to touch the top of the counter white polish off it's about a guy just real simple process  you said you've all  [Music]  you can see how all the press marks went away after the epoxy self level and cured it's what we call it our living resin it's moving and flowing and blending for the next eight hours while it's curing until it gets us to its hardness and where it doesn't doesn't move anymore it's a really amazing product that's why they always look different ten hours later all your roller marks your brush marks go away and then you have a an awesome blended marbleized countertop this is truly one-of-a-kind  thanks for watching the video guys don't forget to subscribe comment the love it us notes you guys none of these colors in this countertop how we went over his existing epoxy counter that we did two years ago just want to show you how simple our process is to change it up if you want to do a remodel you can just go right over your existing Lazzari countertop kit thanks again guys and we'll see you next time remember the guy comm had you covered  [Music]", "u_MWbZsDHC8": "if you buy a country block and it just happens to have a couple of railway carriages sitting on it for most people the last thing that they would do is look at those carriages and say I'm gonna live in those but Mandy did and eight years later her restoration project has turned into a fabulous home I'm very excited to share this place with you [Music]  hi hey hi hey how are you good lovely to meet you welcome and what an incredible location you have found here thanks God I can't really put it on for you today isn't it certainly has absolutely panoramic views and what an interesting home you have thank you how did you actually come to be living in a railway carriage I get asked that all the time and I honestly have to say that the railway carriages found me because it wasn't something I was looking for at all I was looking for a bush block on the west coast near the beach and I couldn't be more further from that if I try I find myself in Centro and I had two derelict trains that just had potential plus written all over them yeah so you actually restored both of these trains entirely just from derelict State yep my ex-husband and I worked for many years restoring them we had to start small we had to start with just a place that we could camp in and we slowly restored one and then went on to restore the other and what a great result because these are just absolutely packed full of character out they are they are indeed can you tell me a little bit about what you've had to do on the exterior well done so much to make the front look pretty we had to pretty much use a lot of the back some of the windows and things were smashed and broken and didn't exist so we use some of the good windows on the back put them on the front for me personally I love the undercarriage I think it's a real unique feature of this carriage but you couldn't see it it was grass and it was a storage place for years of where we kept all our wood while we were renovating so a very recent thing for me was to get under there clear it with the help of some friends because I don't like spiders and then put all the gravel and and really make a feature of the undercarriage because it shows what it is because when you've got such history that's just tied into a structure it's such a shame to just hide it isn't it absolutely absolutely had to be shown yes sir and I can't help but notice your bathtub I bet that gets a lot of use oh not as much as I would like but yes it's in the sensational spot water here is a bit of an issue so I have to choose very carefully when I want to take the bath but we're in Big Sky Country the stars here are just phenomenal so I love it well I would love to have a look at the inside and see what you've done in there come on in have a look oh this is lovely it has just as much character on the insight as it does on the exterior doesn't it yeah it does it does it must have been a tremendous amount of work renovating it to the standard it has taken a tremendous amount of work indeed blood sweat tears absolutely everything so when you first started this project this was just an empty passenger carriage pretty much full of a lot of crap and a lot of damp I just remember sec folds of did boots but yeah it's pretty much just a blank canvas a damp one yeah so we had to start from scratch and the first thing was making it dry so the first thing was getting a roof on top because we wanted to be able to come here and camp here and work on it and we couldn't do that to start with I was just sleeping in the back of the car for a while right yeah I think most people would see a project like that and just think it's too much work I'm not going to do it what was it that pushed you and motivated you to complete the project we completed projects before so we went shy of hard work or project our previous projects were always been working on boats and yachts so that's excited us this was like this new challenge it was like we knew it was going to be hard work we weren't familiar with railway carriages at all we loved old things and we love bringing life to old things in we were excited by this right from the start despite everyone thinking we were crazy so tell me a little bit about how you've laid out the interior space it took a while to sort of figure out in their heads how we want it because the back wall was so rotten initially we had ideas of blowing it out and you know doing different things but we really wanted to try and stick with the original shape and form of the carriage so in the end we had to lose some windows so we decided we were going to lose it down that in and that would be the kitchen we didn't need Windows from the kitchen so we used Windows from dead end to make good the front we did have that ding wall there didn't have a duel at the time so it made sense that that was the bedroom we found a door and then we decided to put in a little ensuite and we didn't know if it could happen but it gained with our background in yachts small spaces it had to happen there was no reason why it couldn't happen so we found some old timber from under the trains and I saw some old doors and we made the little ensuite happen so yeah bedroom ensuite lounge kitchen the tin roof well it was up for debate for a long time the tin was so rusted and it was so catchy we just didn't think it could be safe but I just I just remember hours of my arms up here just dying shaking trying to fill all the gates and and it's turned out really good yeah and I'm really pleased I'm really proud of the tin roof that we saved it's not very flesh but she's original all the way but yeah a lot a lot of time spent sanding in here this used to all be painted and so we standard and scraped but we didn't scrape and sand right back to nothing because we really wanted it to tell its story so we wanted to have you know the numbers that told what seat you were sitting in and we wanted the watermarks because that was part of her history she was a sinking ship for a while there there's even a cute little way and spot over on the wall here where someone's marked how many trips they were making on the train that's really cute and that's really cute so we sanded and got it back to wood but we didn't send it back to pristine we didn't want pristine we wanted really tell a story do you know what you the trainer's I had no idea no idea fair enough no I did don't know a lot of history about it but when we were scraping back the paint we scraped back the old sign up there above the door so one day when I've got time I'm hoping I'll be able to research and find a bit more information about the carriage so yeah we're but does point it to say that she was only second-class though if you look at the site and well she's first class now and then tell me about your kinship ah my kitchen that's quite funny cuz I'm not much of a cook so I don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen the kitchen was a going to trade me find and we like the color and everything was sort of built around the kitchen I like the batter's thing as well it's very nice yeah it just um spoke to us and see by me and so that's what I did so yep they look around the kitchen have a lovely guest oven which works really well and so is this from the original train as well no I did bring in a few little knickknacks oh that's from another carriage that one this carriage obviously didn't go from particularly to Thai hippy this was based in central so this carriage would have done the run from Dunedin through to Alex and then your lounge space so cozy and that fire is higher yes that's what makes this a home I think everything revolves around that fire and that fire is the difference between surviving here in winter and not we actually thought that in a space we'd need two fireplaces saw that loved it got it and then was super-excited that it works so well and we realized that we didn't actually need a stick a fireplace so it's just amazing it's a hub and then can you tell me what you've done down the other end - or come down here like this here quite proud of us this is the little ensuite yes so um and here we have everything except for a little toilet so having removed the toilet from the caboose what are you doing for a toilet here now I've got a long drop toilet just outside very exciting time for me finding keyboard and finally hit hot water because we'd spent three years just them swimming down at the local River hole so it was very exciting fair enough because until you have a hot shower you're really just camping aren't you yep absolutely I think that was what to find thus becoming a home and becoming real live here we can live here we could do this and in your bedroom sir yeah yep come on through this is so cozy yeah my little cave when you wake up in this location you must just have the most incredible feeling of accomplishment and what you've done here Wow yes well coming up here I never fail to sleep I come up here and just sleep and love it and wake up in yes fantastic so tell me a little bit about what you've done here in the bedroom I really think this was probably the worst room this at some point was an old kitchen or something and it was just disgusting this room so this was actually the first room we furnished because we needed that little camping space and this way place so we worked on this first to make this our little place to camp and it was very excited when we finally achieved it how do you find storage here do you have enough room to store everything you need yeah generally I'm down on my other carriage the queen bed that's been built and we've got secret storage under there but storages storage is not bad I mean you make things work I mean their bedside tables that you see there they were part of a big dresser and we just cut the ends off and we've got some beautiful bedside tables that fit the space and look like they were made for it so they really do yeah we should we take a look at the other carriage and see what you've done there I mean why not okay what size would you say that the carriages are cool I say roughly about 40 feet long and I know that 2.2 meters wide and I see a solar panel on this one is that how you get your power here yes Solar solar noise they have a very trusty generator because of course you're not really able to connect to any surfaces here I know and I don't think I'd want to yeah kind of like it like the selecting off the grid this dick looks brand-spanking-new compared to everything else here doesn't it it's only been a week I think since I've had this in and I've been waiting for years to get this dick in so I'm very excited so well silver off like the other one so it's looking for a shiny at home it certainly does yeah so what do we have in here oh come on side this is the spare bedroom this is where friends family and guests come and stay and how fortunate to have this little bit of extra space because it wouldn't really be anywhere to put anyone on that one but having this just gives you that option doesn't it such a bonus and I love the fact that not only is it two carriages but they're two different carriages as well you got the passenger carriage and then you've got the goods carriage and they both have completely different characters and quirks about them and this was the really good storage under the bed that you were talking about yes we had this vision that we wanted to have this and so I had to find the piece that would fit and so these are actually old drawers they only go back to here and then beyond that a secret storage space underneath and I love what you've done with the suitcases up here I wanted to showcase my suitcases which I've been hoarding for years my suitcases now 11 did you start buying the suitcases after you purchase the carrier you must have somehow known that you would end up living here when the trains found me yeah so what do we have next door out come on throw a sigh that's here for some reason there's been nicknamed the library it's not really a library but one day it might be a library there's a few books in here there's a box in here this is probably the least finished of the two carriages but it's a lovely place just to come sit and contemplate I love it I love this room don't know what it is I just love it it really has such a great feeling I love the way that you've got sort of the green color on the wall that goes down to the feature doors at the end there the nice little sitting nook and you've even got a little platform off the back here I had to have my little G&T dick this is my GMT dick come on out very cool and again you just really get to take advantage of those mountain views here don't ya I love that the stick sort of serves the purpose of storage underneath so I've got my ride on Walmart tucked in underneath but yeah I can come out here lawns mowed my attacked and underneath sit down and just enjoy it and doing it Vista this isn't a big enough section for a write on lon that's very true you most certainly do so you moved onto this property eight years ago right yeah and how long since they've actually been livable oh I know that the work has really slowed down in the last three years so I'd say five years five years of part-time work to get them to the stage where we could come in yeah enjoy it's interesting because I've always I love paintings and you'll see stashes around and I've always wanted a big home that I can put up all my pictures I've now got this carriage with no wall space to put up pictures but I have these beautiful windows and each window frames that landscape beautifully and I could just sit here for hours taking in their view and just watching the light change and I just love it the different moods of the big sky country is just magic and so now that you're actually here living on-site most of the hard work is done how are you actually finding living here I love it I love it I never want to leave unfortunately where I work I have to live on-site summer away from here for long periods of time which just gets hard and harder to leave I just love it I can't wait for this to be my full-time home and obviously this is a long project that's been done over a number of years could you even hazard a guess at what it's cost you to achieve this here it's really hard to put a figure on given that we did so much to the labor ourselves and we recycled and we reused if I was to guess I'd say maybe 50 grand that is a great result for two beautiful homes yeah I'm pretty stoked so what's next to you haha well these projects are set on going I'm here for a while yeah my list is huge I'm sure it will continue to be very rewarding these are really beautiful carriages I am so impressed with your restoration project thank you so much for sharing your gorgeous home with me thank you for visiting this could not have been an easy restoration project and you can just see that such a tremendous amount of work has gone into making this place happen what I really love about it though is that so much of the original heritage and history of these carriages has been left intact and it just builds so much character into the home this place really is something very special [Music]  you", "eawqY8ibqik": "I recently was divorced and we ended up selling the house and I figured if I got to start a new life I don't have to live it in Minnesota I would love to travel so selling the house and having some extra money I just decided yeah I'm gonna go look for my life on the road I have all the everything I need you know I have my house I have a truck to pull it and my dogs more than willing to go so here we are [Music] hi I'm Kim Harmsen welcome to my tiny house I've kind of named it two different names it's called the dog house because I have a dog Maisie she thinks this is her house more than it is mine the other house is the redo house because I probably had to do everything at least twice on this house when doing it because learning by yourself you do it your way first and then you do it the right way you do work out your bugs I think on the road you know stuff happens and you deal with it and then you fix it I have been living on the road for probably since the beginning of June since it's now on the end of August so a couple months when I decide to find that perfect place and it doesn't mean I'm gonna quit traveling it only means that I guess what I'm looking for is maybe an area where I can purchase maybe some property or rent some property I'd rather purchase some property set my a tiny house there and then still use my truck and maybe just put a truck camper on it and travel that way then and I'll just have my house in one spot and won't have to tour the whole thing everywhere we are in my comfortable spot this is where we sit relax this is Maisie she's my French Bulldog she's a rescue this is her favorite spot of course is the couch I call her the white potato because she is just totally a potato lounger I also had put this bay window in because it gets such a great view outside I ended up getting a good suggestion of what I could do for my windows because blinds are so expensive and I really wanted blinds of some kind to block blackout but I didn't want to block out the light of it so my sister-in-law dolly Krell says hey I get these paper shades at Walmart and you can cut them to size with just a little knife and they come with these great clips for clipping up to any length you want and they fit all the time because you trim them yourself so it's great for a little little window as little spaces I made this closet out of a door I had cut in half and then used it as a closet a lot of stuff in my tiny house is either reused or I do a lot from the restore so a lot of reclaimed stuff reusing that's what I loved about this so this is just a little dresser I bought at an antique place but the best thing I bought it for was this is because it drops down to a desk so I can just sit here and work on my computer do whatever it's kind of like my mail center so that was one of my great finds and you can find stuff like that once in a while and when you're building a tiny house and you find stuff like that you should just buy it if you really love it and then incorporate it into your house and that's the best thing about building a tiny house by yourself is because you can buy stuff and then that's how you build around it then the next thing I found was this ladder because I couldn't it was such a short space that I couldn't build steps long enough to come down on and so I wanted to find a step stool that I could use because I can use it other places so what you do is you just take it off out of the rubber stoppers I bolted to the top of the dresser and so this way I can use it to plug in my TV my VCR reach my lights do my fan because right now that's hooked up and then it just sits right back in there just as easy as it came out so now we're kind of getting in too close to the kitchen so I put in a wood-burning stove it's called the squirrel if you didn't notice the squirrel on the side but it's got a great viewing window and sitting on the couch and being able to watch a fire when I'm gonna be somewhere long enough would be fantastic that's kind of one thing I'm looking forward to I put it in this spring so I had one fire in it to make sure I had the piping all right and everything and that the smoke was going the right way that's the only fire I've had in it but yeah moving on to May countertop area of my kitchen so this is a toolbox that I ended up buying and everybody I have that has come in here said that's like the greatest thing because you can store so much in it and it's got great sliding drawers I keep a lot of supplements tons of space but the big drawer on the bottom is so great because that's all my pots and pans my toaster my blender a few other dishes that I couldn't get in cupboards and stuff it's the greatest storage and the best thing is when going down the road it has one lock and it lacks all the drawers turn the key and you're ready for travel and it lacks it totally my counter space it's all close to my plugins so like I say I can put my blender up here and a few other things shove them down there when I'm traveling this also these magnetic spice things are great or if you want to use it from something else they stick all on the bottom and they never fall off this is also one of my purchases at the restore I have so many things from the restore but it's just a cupboard regular cupboard that we put I hung on the wall put my TV up here above it and I also it's great cuz it has a lip around it so my VCR sits right on top and then when I travel just tucks down it goes nowhere so another kitchen find at the restore was this and I keep I really don't do much cleaning stuff because I kind of chemical on that part so everything's chemical free stuff but I keep my food in there and some under here my waters this countertop with my sink is a hand hammered copper sink which I love it's actually a bar size and because I see so many of these like tiny houses with these farm style sinks but when you're living off the grid and you can't use a lot of water it's nice to have something small to wash your dishes in not have to fill a huge sink you know with wasting your water so that's how I do it with a bar size sink well I always wanted this window lower and it was actually supposed to be that window up there was supposed to be long and kind of narrow but right in here but actually no I'm kind of glad I put the big window in and it's a little bit taller because it's a window that I can keep open at night and I really don't worry about you know being a woman on the road by yourself you're kind of safety things you kind of go into safety mode and go oh you know I can't have that or I don't want to do it that way because it's a safety issue so this window I feel like I get it it's so high off the ground that I can keep it open if I want as you can see I have my stairs going up into my large loft area but underneath is my food storage and then I'm gonna eventually connect these so what this is right now my charger inverter is underneath here for solar because I am totally off-grid I do have two solar panels so that's my inverter I do have a berkey water thing when I stay at a place longer I pull that out but if I'm not staying real long I use bottled water for drinking everything else is for the sink and shower I have a full size to me fridge because I've seen a lot smaller freezer on top packed to the gills and then a fridge has plenty of room for especially just one person I mean really sometimes a little bit over it is a propane fridge I can do electric or propane so I run strictly on propane mostly off-grid my my little stove does run on propane and it does have a little oven and a little broiler area or warming it's I was going to just put in a counter top one and then I the plug-in oven that I really liked but I figured it you know if I've got all this I'm probably not gonna be baking a whole lot so I don't know I just thought that this made more sense to me and it was a good deal I got it for Half Price because it has a big dent in this side which you'll never see my tea shelf like kind of call it my tea shelf and those things will ride down the road and they never fall off this is my utility room I have a 50 gallon water barrel I have an outlet on the outside that I put in that goes directly to fill my barrel I have a tankless hot water heater that runs on the propane I have just my regular camper pump water pump sure flow coming out this is my charger controller for my solar has my readouts and stuff that I always keep an eye on to see make sure everything's charging right this is my bathing water my washing dishes it's just that water I don't keep it for drinking because you never know sometimes where you're getting your water and I do filter it before it gets into the barrel but I still use drinking water and that's why I have the the Berkey I'm super happy that it all all works some of my wiring doesn't look real pretty or anything but you know hey it works I will now take you into the bathroom so I just have this curtain because I didn't really have time before I left to put in doors and I kind of liked the curtains they're very versatile and maisy can come in any time she wants so I have the composting toilet the nature's Head toilet that's the one that has the fan that constantly runs I have the great countertop cupboard that I ended up finding at some woman's garage that they went out of the hair business and they had this and I turned it into my vanity for my bathroom and put my hand painted sink in it which I just love I get a lot of compliments on this sink other than that I do have a tub and shower that I put in it's just a camper size tub you know you got to sit in there with your knees up but it's still a tub which I still enjoy taking just a bath if I want to once in a while and I don't you try to use a lot of water there either I do part shower and then whatever's left from showering then that's my bath water  [Music]  [Music] transitioning was pretty easy since I built it myself and I kind of knew where everything you know how it worked and where I wanted things as I was building it living in here was really no transition my truck is like oh my god that's ok I got to change make sure I get my oil change keep an eye on that keep an eye on my temperature while pulling this so I think that's people with motorhomes they kind of have to take that in consideration to where my truck is separate it's not as detrimental if my truck breaks down you know I can take that into a shop as long as I got somewhere to unhook from this and usually if you go to the dealership wherever you're gonna go they might have room especially where you can unhook and then your truck gets fixed where someone their whole house has to go in mine doesn't so what that's one thing I do like about it a lot of people maybe don't think about come on up to the bedroom this is my large bedroom I have I call them Halfmoon windows in I have a scarf over it right now that I use as a shade which I like because it still gives me light but yet privacy I do have the paper shades on my smaller windows and they do come up and I usually get a really nice cross breeze coming through usually those times when you get dead air and then I have this heat or this fan that actually just fits right in this window and I use that and it works really good to stay cool if you notice my bedspread I'm gonna do a little thing so my daughter designed this and she's on red bubble and you can buy her products right on red bubble my storage for my clothing you want to come around to this side these were planter boxes that's a store that it worked at had to get rid of all their plants so I took them all with the ones with the wood boxes because they came with these great metal containers in them and I just flipped them on their side painted the Front's and now they're clothing storage and I have all my clothes in all of them different seasons different stuff between jean shorts tops tank tops yeah it's all spread out so this is my second bedroom which is a smaller bedroom because of where the door is so it has a single bed and then just a little bit of floor space it doesn't have as much as mine because of where the door I put the door that's why I built the bed above the doorway because that was empty space and I didn't have to use this little tiny area putting a bed in and then have no area for people to move around in it or me to store anything so I hung it above the doorway it also has a Halfmoon window in it and right now as you can see I have just a few storage things that I keep up here I put this window in just because it fit here and I found I've had this window was out in my shed for like ten years and I brought it in I said I really want to use this someplace and I looked up and here we had already put this window in way before I fall in this window out in my shed it does open I just don't have anything I open it with I stuff a pillow in there or something but it does have a blackout paper shade so people who are up here can have have their own little peaceful area so this is my storage shed that I put on so it can hold my all my propane so I do have the 430 gallon tanks here I just keep my the rest of my pipe for my wood-burning stove in here that I have to put on once I decide that's where I'm staying for a while leftover compost stuff for your toilets just a little shed enough to keep some stuff you don't want in your house like the propane tanks for one I guess what I'm targeting people like women especially who are going to be on their own no matter what age don't give up your dreams especially if you don't think you can build out here so many people say I could never do that well I did it so anyone can do it because I don't have any experience whatsoever in building you can get people to help you can get a lot of information off the internet and you can get lots of advice from people like me who have done it and can give you advice so keep up that Instagram account at tiny house of Oken I'd like to give a shout out to Aaron bus for the greatest guy in solar ever he taught me a lot about solar and so when you're thinking about doing stuff like that learn how to run it and do that it's not real easy but it is totally learn about and the more you're doing it the easier it is to be off-grid thank you  [Music]  [Music]", "voztwgixwtg": "", "IqtOoyRVQ1A": "Hey, everyone. I am here with Mike from Tiny House Chattanooga here at the North Carolina Street Festival. And this is your new tiny house on wheels isn't it? Absolutely yeah, we appreciate it. It's hard to call this a tiny house on wheels because it's pretty huge. Correct. This is a tiny mansion, I guess you could say. It is a custom unit for somebody and for what they're going to do is it just kept growing. So it's 39 total feet. So it's a very large one. And the total square footage on the house? Uh, 375. Wow, and what does something like that weigh? Well, for us it weighs seventeen thousand three hundred pounds. It's a steel frame house, not a wood frame, and so it's an easy 3,000 pounds lighter. Really like the finish on this one as well. Yeah. It looks like you've actually use some really interesting materials with this one. Like, from a distance this looks like wood siding but it's not, is it? Correct. It's made by Quality Edge, it has got the wood grain look to it and it has multiple colors, you know? But it's steel, foam-backed, it's super lightweight. Goosenecks are kind of a new thing when it comes to tiny homes. We're starting to see goosenecks become more popular as the size of tiny houses increase, particularly here in the United States. What's actually the benefit of building a gooseneck? It is way easier to move the gooseneck. Like, 200 times safer. It's the way it holds the weight in the truckbed. It never wants to sway. Okay? And from there it's a different layout function, to me. It gives you the option to build a structure on top of that gooseneck that you can stand up in and so when we go inside, you'll be able to see what I mean. It's six foot seven in the center of our gooseneck right now. Six seven? Yes, sir. I gotta see this. Can we have a step inside? Absolutely yeah, please. Alright, let's do it. Check this out. I walked into a lot of tiny houses, right? But this just has a completely different feel. I mean, this is so open and 40 feet in length I can see to the back there, right? That's pretty long, yeah. That's really something. It's just the shift that I'm seeing. You know, we do build the 20s and the 24s and all that stuff but this is actually more doable, at this size. Especially if you've got a family or something I can really see this working for larger families or even just people who are perhaps intending on having something which is portable but not something that they are wanting to necessarily move all the time. Correct. Right. Yeah. It also helps out with taller folks. And beautiful kitchen, look at this. Yeah, it's a nice kitchen. Really nice outlets. You know, it's a lot of kitchen and so you have plenty of room to do anything you want here. You can have a party, you can cook, you can do anything. But at the same time, it's not too big. Yeah. Right, it's just got all the necessary parts. You know, this is a semi full-size stove, not quite the full-size. Decent size fridge, microwave. Um, it's just usable. That's kind of point. That's what the bigger size does, it makes it more usable. Absolutely, you've even managed to get your washer/dryer in here? Yeah, washer/dryer combo, washes and it dries. Tucks in nicely right there. You know, you can actually fit nice double doors and units like this, you know? You can do the glass where it lets in the light. It's big enough, not too big Oh, that's nice! That way it's big enough, not too big. It's only a 4-foot double, not a five or six to take the way wall space, but you can still bring in a light, right? Because we all know more windows the better, but to me there's a balance. Too many windows, you've lost a lot of wall space and especially in a smaller unit you need the wall space for something. Especially the storage you can see on this side which doesn't have as many windows, but you managed to get all of the storage up here, right? Yeah. So then, coming up into the gooseneck. sure stare up into the bedroom area and on the way up you have Sure. Stairs up into the bedroom area. And all the way up you have, uh, stairs that lift open. Oh, look at that! Just little cubbies here, and of course they could be drawers or whatever you might want. Electrical panel is hiding in this little cubby right here, just somewhere to hide it. Because there's a couple things in a tiny house: electrical and water heater, where you put it. And so for this particular unit, there was nowhere to put the electrical it ended up right here. Great. Really good solution. And then again, up here is really spacious. Yeah, you're six four, correct? Six four, yeah. Yeah, so this six seven for sure, finished. You've even managed to get storage under this bed right? Correct. Uh, it does lift. We won't go too far with because there's not a lot of weight on it right now. Uh, but you got drawers and you have full access back there. When you actually do make the decision to boost up to a larger size like this, it just gives you so much more options. I mean when you think about what you can achieve and the smaller model of tiny homes that extra few feet can make all the difference width- Sure. -and all of a sudden we've got all of the functionality, but it's really the ease of access that's improved, isn't it? You're not having to climb ladders to get into the sleeping loft or stairs or compromising on, like crawl spaces. Exactly, yeah. I mean, it's just a bit more normal, isn't it? Yeah, I mean like so we've done many shorter ones. We do like to do them, um, but we're seeing that it's the baby boomer age, they do not want 24 feet. They almost won't do it. And so you got to get that unit just big enough to make it simple for them. Yeah. Whether its ease of use, stairs not too steep, right? Or no stairs at all, we do that as well. And so it has to be kind of geared towards where they're at in life, versus maybe where the millennials are in life. They don't mind the stairs or the tight stairs, the ladders, and crawling, right? And so is offering a different option for the folks that want the other way. And bathroom, bathroom's right the way down the other end. Yeah. And really, really nice-size bathroom. This is a full size bathroom. You know, 60 inch shower pan or a tub option could be there as well. Sure, it is definitely big enough for a tub there. Absolutely. Is that a seat you've got in the shower in this one? Yeah, that one's a seat. Uh, this is like a pan that you can buy with a seat for the kind of the old older crowd I guess you could say. Composting toilet as well. There's no compromise in space. This is actually quite a normal sort of ensuite sized bathroom. Exactly. If you do the layouts correctly you can pretty much achieve this size bathroom, even in a 24. So what actually pulled you into building tiny houses? I was in the residential world doing building and flipping houses, remodels, everything and I saw the shows, like everybody else, I was like, well that'd be kind of fun. Different was what I was shooting for and so we tried one- -but we did it different. We went steel frame, not wood frame, and so we searched out took me four months to find somebody in the U.S. then we found a company called Vollstruct struct and we kind of worked together and now they're everywhere. When we're building tiny houses, we're building a vehicle first and a house second. It needs to be safe, it needs to be secure and there's something about the strength and weight benefits to building with steel that really does make it a very strong contender. Absolutely, because what folks don't realize sometimes is like you said this is a vehicle first. It is a home, and that's fine. But it has to take the abuse of a road. So you have to start correctly, so its trailer, make sure it's the correct one because there's plenty that are not. And then for us, it's a steel frame. That way it can take that abuse. So obviously, this tiny house is a little bit larger than the ones that we're used to seeing. How does that affect the budget of a project like this? The budget for this one ended up being 96 thousand, for what they wanted. I think this is a really exciting project. It's really cool for me to be in this house and being here in the United States, the tiny homes are definitely bigger just as I expected and it's really cool for me to be here. Thank you so much for showing me around and I hope the festival was great for you. Definitely appreciate it. Thank you", "5JVcE8gho4k": "", "zC6TkbmnU08": "with just a little bit of know-how and a whole lot of spirit it really is incredible what people can accomplish today we've traveled to byron bay to visit one DIY tiny house project that i think is really going to impress [Music]  get a bin how's it going good good thank you mate high net lovely to meet you guys this house is absolutely striking thank you very much the timing for our visit worked out absolutely brilliantly because you are only just finishing up the build of your home now aren't you we are yeah literally putting together the sort of final pieces of the puzzle at the moment we spent nearly a decade in the sukkot industry living on boats living in spaces this big with like five or six crew so this is relatively like us compared to that yeah so we've been home in Australia for a few years now and this is sort of part of our journey of moving back into the country I love the style it's very unusual can you talk to me a little bit about the design here yeah sure so we've got the recycled windows on the outside with a corrugated iron and Western redcedar cladding sort of combination of all the three and and the white we knows we felt this styling sort of suited really nicely and yeah so the corrugated iron cladding was a sort of few different reasons one of them was the coal we liked the colour and the aesthetic of the corrugation and also the extra bracing that it applied to the side of the building as well we're going to use 70 mil stud framing so the extra bracing was actually really effective for the house and one of the really unique features about this house as well is this really interesting wedge that you've got on the top there can you talk to me about how that works yeah sure that was a labor of love the whole idea of that is to give our standing Headroom in our loft which we sort of considered quite important for our our long-term livability in the house yeah so it's road-legal height with the roof level and then it pops up once the house is in position now the wedge looks like quite a complicated thing to put in can you talk to me about how this was built and how its installed it's relatively simple in terms of what it is it's not really easy to put in it's a bit heavy it's a bit cumbersome we can do it with two but three people is much easier so the first thing we do is we lift the roof up the big windows go up first and they sit up on the roof and then the two wedges go in one at a time one on each side and then we stand up the front two windows and put it against the two wedges we then put the roof down and put the screws in that hold it all together and throw it down to the frame and up to the roof as well and then we've got a series of cover plates that go over the top of the screw holes on the inside to sort of make it look a bit pretty on the inside now this whole build was done as a DIY project wasn't it yeah it's been a real labor of love the whole thing it's been probably six months of intense building we're unemployed at the moment so yeah this is pretty much all we've done for six months is just focus on this weed yeah we want me to help my dad has to be credited with a huge amount of work in this project and my brother as well has been down quite a lot to help us out but ya know it's been a great project and it's been awesome to do it ourselves and I think the fact that we know so much about it now is really beneficial for us so the things that we enjoyed I guess were the creativity that this project allowed us to have we sort of had a bunch of ideas in mind and it was really fun to be able to sort of make them become reality we had a vision at the start and what we've ended up with is quite similar to that vision so there's a lot of sort of satisfaction in in that I really enjoyed being able to share our daughter too that the girls can use tools as well and she got to see me using the drop saw and she got to be a part of the building process and she was hammering away and we gave her screws and she had her own tool kit and so that was really really cool really empowering for her so what are the dimensions of this home the trailer itself is seven point eight meters on the deck 2.5 wide and it's four point three high when the roof is folded down and the spot that you're parked up on here it's absolutely idyllic what's the story of this place yeah so we're very fortunate this is family land it's mom and dad's property so we're very lucky to have this little spot to call home the tiny house so this actually isn't its final resting place it's going to move a little bit in the not-too-distant future but yeah being in here surrounded by the trees and in the environment Yearwood we're very fortunate how much land do you have here it's about two hundred and sixty acres in total Wow and for your parents being able to have you here to help manage that must be an essential part of the equation for them it most definitely is they get just as much out of it as we do we're really excited about the opportunity as well to help them look after it we've got some lots of plans to do a lot of bush regeneration and whatnot here so yeah it's a great opportunity for them and and for us yeah it works beautifully we've both done such a phenomenal job on the exterior of the house I cannot wait to see how you've kid it out on the inside can we check it out yeah that's good thank you oh this is absolutely beautiful what a fantastic job you've done in here thank you very much I really love the style can you talk to me about the design in here yeah well a lot of discussions over how we should go about it but we both love natural Timbers and we wanted it to be as low-impact build as we could reasonably make it we use natural paints it means two natural tumors that we sourced locally and flooring that was a hard fight and did a lot of research to find the Baltic pine flooring and have it brought up from Melbourne it's so lightweight and so we wanted it to be clean and white and open so that it would feel as big as possible yeah still warm with the timber and lots of places for me to put my plan I do love all of the plants in here that looks really nice it's amazing how quickly plants can just make a space feel so homey mm-hmm definitely I really enjoy having plants in the space as well so that was a factor in our design and we always knew where we were going to place them and had some growing ahead of time ready for their new home we also really wanted the house to engage with the outside as much as it does on the inside as well so the house is like a place that we live but a half the idea of the tiny house is that we actually spend a lot more time outside the house as well so engagement with the environment was really important to us and the placement of the windows sort of where they're positioned helps you engage with the outside when you're hanging out inside the house throughout the house you really can see the beautiful Timbers that you've used in here even the Shelf is just a really striking timber what does this wood oh yeah so it's cane floral which is actually a naturalized weed in the Northern Rivers area and it just happens to be beautiful timber when it's all up looking nice we're really really happy with it this shelf is also a structural element of the house it's batten screwed through the studs into the back of the shelf so it's a stiffener for this wall at the same time and now tell me about the design of the kitchen well we really wanted it to be clean again and open and we know that spaces like this can get cluttered really quickly so lots of storage and we also wanted it to flow out onto our one day deck so that people can be out there and we can be cooking again it can be all one space yes so we were also inspired by other tiny houses that we've seen of late and this is just the design and we really loved that we felt comfortable with great that you've managed to put the fridge into the Steyr space as well yes Oh full-size fridge was something we really wanted and yeah it just made sense to put it under the stairs and so we built all the stairs ourselves kind of around our existing fridge it fits there really well and it's actually really good spot for it and then down here we have your lounge area yes oh it's built into the house it's obviously designed be lounge be comfortable but it's also covering the wheel well so it's still exposed on that side you can see but because we have the lower trailer we have a wheel well so it was important to us to build this in so that it did cover that we couldn't put an actual piece of furniture in here cuz the wheel wells in the way so it works really well to build it in not my cushions for and everything it's good it's comfy lanch fantastic and then you've built storage into these as well I'm guessing yeah yep so underneath we just lift them up there just hinged tops and there's also HDMI cable so we're gonna put a DVD player in there and it's then linked up to this little hatch on the wall here just gonna have a little projector on it which is gonna shine onto all of you onto a spring just behind your than window there there is a very clever idea I love the way that you've built that in we wanted to still be able watch movies and whatnot obviously but yeah we didn't want to have a TV that was potentially always on in the house so yeah we sort of thought that was a nice way of taking over to watch movies and not over TV and not taking up extra wall space for a TV which we don't really have any spare wall space anyway windows are better absolutely I completely agree and you've built an extra storage space into your stairs as well yes we do so I'm gonna put our shoes potentially and we've got the family drawers here so the dog gets bottom one Charlie gets a little toy one and mom and dad get the high ones a few others and we also put this one in here as a bit of a pantry you're the pantry or maybe some gin that is a really good idea I love the way that that's been done and then I see some stairs there behind the couch where does that lead us goes up to our daughter's blocks can take a look yes please this is adorable what a cute little space so how old is Charlie she's two and a half so she's very excited that she can touch the roof her loft and yeah she's got her very own room that she's helped decorate and chosen the colors and her very first big-girl bed so it's a big deal so yeah we've added a little desk for her because she loves drawing and we wanted it to be a really nice place for her to hang out so she's got a little cushion and she's already been sitting up here drawing away so that is a very sweet addition I like how you've done that and then can you talk to me about the plans that you've got for this roaming because you're doing some things to safety proof it for a toddler aren't you we are yeah we're really worried about it so we've got to stay kind of ladder and it lands on the couch so if anything is tapping she'll land on a soft surface there's plans to to put shutters there on order so that she won't fall out and she can open them and we're going to put rigid flyscreens and or something on the windows to stop her hanging out it's like some security measure or something like that so yeah she's super biased at the moment at all times and she hasn't actually slept up here yet but once still safe she gets to and then underneath here you've got your bathroom don't you yeah sure do yeah so this is our bathroom I love what you've done here with this waterfall vanity that's such a nice touch thank you that's that's actually the off cut from the can for shelf that's out in the lounge room out there beautiful it's quite an interesting design what you've done here with the composting toilet can you tell me about that so the toilet bits fairly standard but it's also got this step which we built specifically for our daughter for Charlie to be able to step up she can step on here and then stand up in here and access the sink up there and wash your own hands and that sort of stuff and cleaner tape there is such a good idea I love how all throughout this house you've just really thought about your daughter and her ability to use and enjoy the space as well yeah that's really important to us and it makes it a lot easier for us as well for her to be able to access everything it's practical but it's also a convenience thing for us that we don't have to supervise as much we can tell her Gamal shams and she can do it without too much input from us and then you've installed the Shub as well which i think is a great idea especially with a toddler you've got to have a place for baths right yeah most definitely and Charlie loves her baths I think Matt actually made one in a bar when we first started talking at tiny houses she right from day one was like how can I feed a bath into that my husband and I consider have a bath more not side yeah it sort of serves a few purposes fantastic it does look like your knees would be around your neck if you were sitting in there though I don't care it's worth it anyway fair enough and it looks like you've got plans to add something in here as well oh yeah so this is where the washing machine is gonna go so we've got the taps in there ready to ready to go say it was important to us that we had a washing machine inside as well in sake and then we've got your sleeping loft up here as well yeah let's go and check it out yes please this is really cool having this which it's amazing how much space it's added to the loft isn't it yeah being able to stand up here really was the whole reason we did this basically it was to be able to stand here at the foot of the bed we can get dressed here really easily we can do whatever we you know whatever we need to do here and have heaps of head on so it's very convenient worth all the trouble of what it takes to put these things up here for sure the placement of these windows is great as well because not only do you get a great view from up here it's also doing a lot to create some breeze through the harness yeah ventilation was yeah a big part of these for sure so it does create you can feel at the moment is a lot of breeze flowing through the house so being up there at the highest point definitely helps to vent air out of the house now we've visited your home right nearing the end of this part of the build but you're nowhere near complete at this point are you you've got big plans can you tell me what's next for your home yeah so we're gonna relocate it a little bit just behind us over there we're gonna put in a new driveway first then we've got a whole off-grid setup that's going to be part of the project as well so we've got a whole big solar system we've got an evacuated tube hot water system it's all got to be set up beside the house once it's in position so yeah that's coming very very soon and for us it's probably one of the most exciting parts of the whole project was not only to build the house but to then use renewable energy and be completely disconnected from the grid so as DIY is what has the process of building your own home band like for you yeah it's been awesome it's been a real journey probably not a long journey in comparison to somebody because we've had the luxury of being able to do it full-time but yeah it's been a journey we've got a toddler running around at the same time which always makes things interesting and to be able to now live in a house that we have built with our own hands it's hugely rewarding for us you have got here at a time when we're literally just moving our stuff into the house and this is like the real beginning of us living in this house it's actually the first time that we really sat back and sort of taken a moment to look at what we've done over the last six months and seen it as a bigger picture so the satisfaction levels are pretty high at the moment weird feeling like we've really achieved something pretty awesome yeah it's suddenly just and come together we just imagined how it would all go together and fit and we're looking at it this home has been beautifully done you've obviously felt a lot of very high quality elements in here do you know at this point what the cost of the builders I haven't added up the last couple of weeks because it's been quite busy there's about 20 grands worth of solar setup and hot water system setup going on so the house itself was about 45 ish and then here 65 total overall this is a really great result for that budget you've both done a really wonderful job thank you both so much for sharing your great project with me thanks thank you for coming Ben and net have done such a great job with this home as first-time DIY is it really is so impressive what they've accomplished here and best of all this project is just getting started I cannot wait to see what happens and how this home transforms once all of the solar and off-grid technology is added to it and hopefully one day we'll be back to check in and see how it's all going [Music] you  [Music]", "eA327Mtrex8": "Hey, I'm Elsa and I'm Barron and today is our one-year anniversary of living in this Scamp trailer. We were living in a one-bedroom apartment about five years ago when Baron brought up the idea to me. The obvious thing that I had on my side was that houses are just stupid expensive and this was a way that we could pay off the house for an amount of money that actually makes sense. We were draining away $700 with that apartment and $900 for a house from a family friend. And that's just rent like utilities and everything-- and that's just Kansas City, too. With Barron I started doing some research on tiny houses looking at YouTube and forums. I would just find the highlights and then bring Elsa all the highlights of the cutest one or the one that was like the most.. something that she would dig and then over and over again.. They're really freaking cool. Tiny houses are SWEET. Fall of 2015 we decided to take a trip to Portland. We'd been looking at some tiny house builders. We thought that we would get a tiny house built for us so that we could save time. We wouldn't have to pay rent living in a space as we were building our tiny house. We like the idea of a tiny house because we could build something custom. So we could get exactly what we wanted laid out how we wanted. We could have workspace, a nice bathroom, all the things that we needed. --Or thought we needed. Ironically we wanted a space where Elsa could set up cameras and have like a good place to do tutorials and stuff and it's kind of hilarious because we have 3 cameras set up right now and we're doing it right here. So, we toured tiny houses and after we left Portland we loved them, like we were all in. I thought it was a great idea and then we got home and looked into loans, like how we were gonna pay for it because they were anywhere between 50 to 80 grand depending on how you did it which was still a lot cheaper than any of the houses we could've bought in Kansas City, so we were still like, okay, we can own a thing-- Then we thought about it and we could do so many things with fifty to eighty thousand dollars. That's a lot of money and that's a lot of commitment We've both been self-employed for several years, so getting a loan with our variable incomes and self-employed tax returns wasn't gonna be easy. It's also amatter of is it an RV loan? Is it a house loan? The other thing was we couldn't find anywhere to park it legally. In Kansas City especially. There was nowhere that we could legally do it aside from an RV park. But then we would be paying rent to an RV park every month and living in an RV park in a tiny house which was not super sensical, no. Tiny homes also are very heavy, so you effectively need a semi truck to pull them around and they're not meant to be towed all the time. So we needed a place to park this thing and to not move it unless we had to. And then all those combined brought us to the idea of RVs. People mentioned it often like, why don't you just get an RV? We stubbornly clung to the tiny house thing because it's cool. RVs are generally pretty heinous looking they look like something out of that 70s show, like intentionally. And we just thought we needed more space, too. We thought that an RV wasn't gonna cut it. It started making more sense that RVs are made to be traveled in, RVs are significantly cheaper it was It was easy to get a loan on them - yeah they're legal. My grandparents have been living in their RVs through the winters for I think my entire life. They're snowbirds and they would go down to Mexico so we drove up to Iowa and with them and toured a bunch of RVs. We went to some RV retailers to look at some used RVs and we looked at toy haulers, for example, and utility trailers Like an empty UHaul. Because because they were convertible we could do whatever we wanted to them. We also looked at truck bed campers with the camper in the truck bed of a truck. and we looked at some other tow behind trailers. We really couldn't find anything much smaller than 20 feet though. Yeah, and we were looking for something smaller. Primarily so that we wouldn't have to get a giant truck. Elsa's grandpa, Huck, insisted that we have a truck over and over again, \"You gotta have a damn truck!\" He wouldn\\'t let it go Well because for most of these you do and we would have, so that was gonna be an added expense. An expense that was probably gonna cost more than the camper itself. While we were in Iowa, we were also on Craigslist trying to find some other places to look for trailers and up finding a teeny tiny little fiberglass trailer in my grandma's neighborhood. It was the first Scamp that we had ever seen and we toured it but it was really small. So small, it had a bathroom so that cut down on its whole size. I thought that it could never be something livable, but it was really cool. It was an older guy that had it and he said that he had travelled the west coast up and down and back to Iowa pulling the scamp with his Subaru which was really appealing to me. That opened an entire new category of things we could live in that maybe wouldn't require us buying an expensive truck. We started looking into fiberglass trailers and at this point we thought that a bathroom was a definite necessity so we were looking at the 16-foot models of the scamp primarily. And as we were thinking about it it was like, well if we didn't have a bathroom we could go down to the next size in Scamps to a 13 foot. Do we really need a bathroom? And after a bunch of thought we kind of realized we didn't want to be pooping in our tiny space, we didn't want to have to carry around all this black water, drain it, clean it, that would take up a lot of space and also just be a huge pain in the butt, and people shouldn't be in a bathroom more than 30 minutes a day, so why would we dedicate 20% of our living quarters to a place where we spend such little amounts of time? There's toilets everywhere. Everywhere! In every public establishment there's a toilet and several in everybody's homes. If we ever needed a toilet, or even now if we decide that we want one for whatever reason We could do a composting toilet and just put it under where we have our shoes. So then we started broadening our search online to 13ft fiberglass trailers. We tried to snag like five of them- If they're under ten thousand dollars they're gone or claimed in like, 2 days. They hold their value well, we really had no idea that there's such a market for fiberglass trailers. They're awesome- yeah they're really cool.- We saw a guy in Minnesota selling his for 4500 with some water damage. 1988, so a little bit older. We borrowed our friend Jordan Mackey's truck and drove it all the way up an hour south of Canada. When we toured the Scamp, it had more water damage than we had previously thought. So, we talked to the guy down to $3,700 and gave him the cash and hooked up the Scamp And drove it back! 20 hours total and then finally decided to stop at Des Moines, Iowa, Walmart parking lot and stay the night I cried. Reality was finally kicking in like, oh my god we're gonna.. We're doin it! We did it! We just did it so, we're doin it I felt pretty good because every time I looked in the rearview mirror and saw our house that was completely paid off behind us I was like, okay.. :D Yeah... -Elsa not so much. We were planning on using my Pontiac Vibe, it's rated to tow about 2,000lbs. I was on the phone with my dad, talking to him about whether we could do it with the Vibe and he was like, couldn't you just do it with the Mini? I guess, maybe. and we looked into it, put a tow hitch on the back, took it on a test drive and the Mini Cooper became our tow vehicle for an entire year. A month before we moved into the Scamp full time, I went with a friend to Vietnam and you stayed back and you worked on- I worked on like all the water damage and just really made the Scamp livable. And the day I got back to the US, we moved out of our house and into the Scamp.. and it was a pretty big thing At first it was very challenging, it is a smaller space. Another difficult thing was getting around societal validation, to like keep doing our thing. It seemed like everybody that we talked to was skeptical and would just tell us that that's not gonna work. So to keep our head on straight and just keep pushing with our vision was pretty difficult, especially initially. --Right now we're kind of like, what should we do? We have our whole house basically on our backs we can, we can go anywhere! But now after your practice we are living full-time in nature, we have more time, we're creating more. We're making so many new friends and connecting with people that we wouldn't have been able to. And we have a cool place for our friends from Kansas City to come out and hang out, too, which is pretty awesome. We are absolutely so much happier living this way than I could have ever imagined. I would have never guessed that this was going to be so incredibly perfect. And honestly, solutions have come more easily than we previously thought. As you do it, or as we do it, we figure out solutions to things more quickly than I could have imagined, truly. So now we're here on a mountain with our new Subaru and a year of scamp life under our belt. And so, our journey begins.. Again! Thanks for watching and we'll see you in our next video! Bye!"}
