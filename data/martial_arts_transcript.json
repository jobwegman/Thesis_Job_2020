people will laugh for a few minutes at your failures and immediately forget the failures of these athletes will be remembered for the rest of their careers hi there and today we will look at the 20 most embarrassing moments in sports at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro during the competition of racewalking something very strange happened a bad case of diarrhea caught this athlete by surprise right during the competition and there was nothing the poor man to do about it in this video the suit of British bobsledder gillian cooked burst open before the start of the descent and became a big hit on youtube  [Music]  Lord of Aston Villa Nicholas Helen OU's would have scored another goal if he had not been hindered in such a cheeky way with shorts at the knees it is quite difficult to score a goal  [Applause]  and this Saudi goalkeeper decided to score into his own goal  [Applause] next we have basketball Sam Decker has an excellent breakaway opportunity but as it gets into the open court he trips over his own feet and ends up knocking the ball out of bounds with his face this is a prime example of how not to play basketball and here we have Chicago Bulls Ford Carlos Boozer while

relaxed too much bright in the cage I think that from now on during future fights Travis will definitely take the toilet paper  and here we see how during the fight both fighters simultaneously sent each other to the ground with a knockout  [Music]  and this is an incredible double knockout after which the fighters could not get up and more than both of them needed medical assistance [Music]

lucky player was in front of an empty net there was no one near him who would prevent him from scoring a goal but the athlete sent the puck to the other side and then tried to turn around and fell the opponent sees the moment and scored a goal themselves  [Applause] [Music] and in this footage the ref decided to stop the fight but the fighters were too carried away by the fight and ignored him and continued to fight it's hard to imagine how it would all end because the judge just fell into a rage and already the other judges came running to help the fighters due to a strong push the uniform of Finnish hockey player Tommy Maki got stuck in the gap between the glass panels the athlete could not free himself so the referee and other players came to his aid  in this video the girls too late as

about the ways of the Chinese masters it's bad to say the best but in my opinion I think boom foo is pretty good welcome foo is originated in China it is the ancestor of karate and jujitsu it's more of a complete system and it's more fluid by that I mean it's more flowing there is continually movement instead of one movement to movement and install a karate bun just like an iron bar what a go punch is like an iron chain with an iron ball attached to the end there it go black and it hurt in something li has studied a system of Chinese gun foo for the past nine years called Wing Chun and is considered one of the arts most talented and articulate exponents his teacher in this art has been an elderly Hong Kong Chinese master by the name of Yip mom despite his proficiency in this style of gung foo his study of philosophy has caused him to question and now he begins to question why most martial artists Chinese and otherwise seem more concerned with preserving tradition then was looking more deeply into the matter to penetrate through to the ultimate rule of martial art moreover Li's begun to develop his own method of gung foo which he describes as non classical in nature and which takes as its core the principles of economy of motion simplicity and directness all right for instance you will read it in a magazine and everything that when somebody grabs you you will first do this and then this and then and then and then and then thousands of steps before you do a single thing of course these kind of magazine would teach you to be fear by your enemies and admired by your friends and everything but in food in always in bomb a very fast motion like poison a guy grabbing your hand it's not the idea to do so many step standby on there instead do let go this is what we mean by sympathy same thing in striking it in everything it has to be based on a very minimum motion so that everything would be directly expressed one motion and he's gone doing it gracefully not go ah yelling and jumping all the way  both the American and Chinese martial art communities resent his iconoclasm for such a young man to stand up against thousands of years of tradition and venerated Authority is considered a direct threat to the status quo and its entrenched power base prior to Bruce's coming to this country you know the young foo was was alive and most on the Chinese community but there was nothing taught to outsiders basically and Bruce came along and and with that basis of trying to create equal equality amongst all people regardless of race he chose to you know to let anybody into his school regardless of what color race they were as long as he knew what was what was in their heart was good and positive why he he took them in and like when he was down in San Francisco where the Chinese committee was much more like being in China they they took exception to it and he had to fight his way out of it in Oakland he received a challenge from the San Francisco Chinese martial arts community and the challenge read that Bruce if he were to be defeated in this challenge would have to cease teaching Caucasian or non Chinese students and the Chinese martial artist who came over from San Francisco to Bruce's studio in Oakland and a very formal challenge took place I was present there in fact I was eight months pregnant with Brandon and James Lee was there and this fight with this Chinese martial artist lasted about three minutes consisted of a lot of running where the Chinese martial artist took off and started running around the room and Bruce was pursuing him before Bruce finally he got a hold of him and took him down to the floor and made him give up well after the challenge ended and with the Chinese martial artist being soundly defeated and they all went away Bruce won the right to teach anyone he wanted to by February 1967 Lee has three schools operating in Seattle Oakland and Los Angeles that teach his own interpretation of kungfu based on his own investigations into the ultimate truth of unarmed combat however by now the young man is openly critical of the traditions and limitations he sees as inherent in the martial arts as they're currently being practiced to America he believes they lack a solid grounding in reality consisting for Hearst self-defense routines that are employed and predictable his rhythms he notes that real combat is spontaneous not rehearsed and is made up of irregular or broken rhythm that a martial artist cannot anticipate only respond to even the championship karate tournaments of the era are non-contact Affairs settled not on knockouts but on an accumulation of points awarded for blows that never touch an opponent a victory is determined by a team of judges who conclude which combatant would probably have hurt the other combatant the most had contact been allowed Lee has no use for such styles of pseudo fighting which he calls organized despair and dryland swimming Lee's criticism of the arts can be attributed in part to his background in Hong Kong which consisted not of non-contact karate tournaments but full-contact street fights and challenged matches  when not fighting against proponents of different style of food rooftops Lee had also fought frequently against knives changes in such a real world encounters referees and judges were not necessary rather than participating in non-contact karate which he considers little more [Music] and the instead devotes himself to devising a more scientific approach to on our economy his research leads him to the science of Newtonian physics and the techniques and principles of European Benson and Western boxing worth efficiency not traditional are the touchstones of both disciplines please research causes him to understand that the only litmus test of a combative techniques worth is whether or not it can be landed effectively on an opponent anything that's ornamental is discarded from his style he retains only those techniques that he himself has determined to be practical in real self-defense situations Lee is the first martial artist in North America if not in the world to have his students gone boxing gloves headgear and body projectors and spar all out nothing is rehearsed no punches are poor and full contact reality based martial art is the order of the day in 1967 Lee introduces the concept of full-contact sparring at the International karate tournament in Long Beach California", "93b3D1rNlZs": "", "nTWnU-AcoOE": "", "ad-Kp4Lu6UI": "", "TBUQtfeICaE": "", "sFlQC8_uPMg": "",

guard [Music] [Applause]  it's a brazil for for having the character brought with him where the knock-up he will use the jab effectively and throw the right hand this is what the ante Wilder does I just came back in March of 2018 and sold and it's funny you could see it happen as before your eyes because he threw a couple left hooks and he was just short of it and that particular one is a man that went in and back the fundamentals of boxing right this Sergei did the right thing throw another hook he throws one hook and then he comes back  [Applause] by the time he goes down  got away with those low punches but the gloves came down and I don't think coaching who's going to get up he's trying we tried mentally but it's been waived here we go that's a great show if you got it if it's if that was slowed down I think you'd probably see well he has to keep his right hand up one and he has to come behind the jail you know to get close [Applause]  [Applause]  the boys have been landing all night but it just happened to land in the right spot and then out goes haste yeah but check out that look at the right hand okay look how it came [Applause]  [Applause] just thought it out another

he needs a knockout to win this fight [Applause] we get up knock out Smith and it's all bad look at this so this is the left yep off the ropes  [Applause] and he saw the greatest from Alvarado after that combination landed if you can't tell I got hurt straight right hand when Newman closed comes out with two punches like that match up here in Biloxi Mississippi that was an amazing amazing amazing fight this is what ended it there it is the left hook oh yeah there's the right hand I got it yeah let me tell you you don't want to catch a punch in the body that winning he was  [Applause] [Music]

in any country with water [Applause] I need to the devastating  but that doesn't mean he got us working fair but sometimes you can get caught running into power like that  there they may stop this fight if he does not get his feet over  but that will do it I told you is explosive but he wasn't ready to stand back in there she's in trouble blasted away he's taken care [Applause]  welcome to Vegas our great Africa tremendous shot the right time they have to get really busted and Williams knows it he's gone he's got down it was the writer and the right uppercut that did the damage and he's just relax are going to move in for the finish right here Conroy is still tucking up and in big drama on that right handers probably just one judge frugal waxing the British light heavyweight belt Conroy is going to do incredibly well to beat this count okay but will he be allowed to continue no he will not so his great credit that he did that's a big big knockdown that was it I don't think that's one that goes Jake and it was just a cumulative effect oh he's that I think and get up that's when he don't want to get it there was no one punch that really did it there it was just the power

or a typical martial Channel I'm a very successful businessman I run multi-million dollar companies today I'm going to show you the three common mistakes that people make in the street fight  good good good guy shop very good thank you I say thank you shame mistake number one in a street fight thinking it's going to be a fair fight you gotta understand when this kind of situation happens things are very unpredictable sometimes you're walking down the street someone trying to rob you someone try to pour a weapon on you someone or maybe in a bar you're walking down and night in the street especially also the ladies right you don't know when it's gonna happen you may be be sometimes they may just come to you it's very sometimes these attackers they come to you in a very positive situation so maybe it's something like the hey man what's up right they're very aggressive but the good attackers sometimes they just hey man they might do something like this watch I'm sorry do you have some change oh that's how they get you verbally they with this arm you they're not thinking about hey give me some we'll give me a Mac you got some change or do you know the direction or where should I go from here the minute they distract you you can see the weapon here you don't see it he was just looking at me I'm talking I pull wrap there's four steps right there so it's not a fair fight how do you know they don't have a weapon how do you know they don't have a gun how do you know they don't have their friends how do those how do you know you're not dealing with multiple components how do you know their friends don't have weapons and how and also the situation in the street what if it's raining what if it's sunny what if it's snowing what if you endure whatever outdoor what in a body's a bottle right there all these things are very very different in street fight when you're training in the dojo in the school that's all good usually it's your training body one-on-one you're wearing a glove that's very very good the minute I pulled this out it changes the whole game right the miniature he might be a very good fighter this excuse me 1020 years of events as a martial artist and anyone can get this for 20 bucks bucks and this kind of knife right I've seen also guys where they have a little clip knife right there I'm kind of unfortunate but a lot now guys you can't even see it it's not as obvious a clip knife on here and they poured it out holy and a lot of guys sometimes not a fair fight they will do something like this and even you're attacking me I just need to get you once we're gonna do we're gonna do from here we're gonna do you see this in prison fight a lot that guys with a toothpaste to sharpen the end of the toothpaste like that like just like that just like this so number one mistake is not a fair fight you go in in an unfair situation with a fair mentality you are you've lost you think oh yeah he's not gonna hurt me he's not gonna stab me he doesn't have a weapon he doesn't have friends everything's gonna be okay he's gonna throw this punch at me he's gonna sold it and I'm gonna block it perfectly at the perfect timing I'm gonna and he's not gonna hit with his hand either it's just gonna stay there and I'm gonna punch him and gonna knock him out with one punch and all very good not hurting badly I'm gonna go home safely no no your job as a man as a woman is to go back to your family go home safe if someone's trying to hurt you do whatever the it takes right if he's trying to hurt you you try to hurt him first it's not a fair fight miss number one mistake number two you give the attacker the signal that you want to fight now you notice that a lot of horse you watch youtube video a lot of these fights they start off with very a very rare it starts off with something like this yo yo what's up what's up no usually it's very close quarter it's this kind of distance right and usually hey what's up man what's up verbally right hey what what what the minute you do that you are signaling the guy you're on a fight remember mistake number one it's not there so why would you give him an advantage thinking you wanna fight him it's the dumbest thing you can do the minute you put up your hand what does that tell you you are fighting right immediately the minute I do my stairs  whoo-hoo Jesus Christ right you dancing with a guy and eat it with no you want to fight me no you know what and I personally I know there's some self-defense classes they like to do this hey man I don't want any trouble I don't even like to do that to me also signals that you want if a good fighter the minute look look at my stance okay look at my stance if I'm like this like this guy right here if he's more neutral one neutral doesn't want to fight yet one foot backward like this he wants to fight he or that stands this is a ready to go where the Explorer kind of stands myself the minute I do this I'm ready to go I don't need my this I'm ready to go I'm ready to explode from here so don't give in a signal don't give any verbal warning the dumbest hey what what what what what it's gonna do would you man what what the man what the men for beep that's four or five free shots think about it it's crazy why would you want to do that so that's mistake number two don't give any signal so learn when you're practicing do your move don't you do your whatever style that you do practice that from your Ongar stance your ready stance first few years you got to learn that stuff later on learn to explode from nothingness learn to move without getting ready so don't get it habit first to learn the technique but when you're fighting when you're in self-defense when you're training for self-defense you don't want to get ready to say some push me oh okay  believe it or not a lot of people do that because that's all I get ready to fight no learn to what push there is nothing I'm in there is no you just flow with it there's no I don't give a signal I don't give me any warning I don't give him anything you just go and ideally you don't even show it in your face you don't even show it like what what what what what like that totally relax when you see someone like that when you see Majan facing me if I show you like this what what and see how I'm signaling on a fight  turn off the emotion there's nothing then you see a light guy I like I like that run that's a scary one when a guy who's very calm he's not nervous it's not like oh like like that or March off it's like totally calm just cool like like that holy you gotta be careful that guy see because that guy it means he's not nervous either he's stupid or just not nervous at all he's just like he knows what's gonna do and just move so that's the second mistake the third most common mistake in a street fight is over estimating that time and distance that you have you're thinking well if I'm gonna get in a fight I'm this close and sometimes you see people leaving the vulnerable target their throw right they're gone they're hit like this thinking you know what in the air money this guy's gonna hit me I'm gonna hit him first I'm gonna grab him I'm gonna do it whatever you do not want to overestimate the distance that you have that's why Brucie talks about the no-man's land it means so let me let me let me just show you you can see it on camera they'd be further out further down further out for the up so stop now this is no-man's land meaning I cannot hit him with my foot I cannot his shin with my hand but he cannot touch me okay this is no-man's land okay so this it's okay to me this is all already kind of like a yellow light okay so go back go back go back more yeah this is safe the distance these you want to chase me what I can see try to run right I can still do all of that this is red we stop we don't we we don't go stop yeah this this to me is yellow this I gotta be ready because although he cannot touch me I cannot touch him right but if I'm good I can bridge the gap pretty quickly right so from here I can bridge this gap pretty if he's good so this is yellow little bit more where I can kind of touch him with my feet I'm just maybe little bit I can touch this him with just tiny little step I can hit him with my my hand this is green this is go when he comes this close it's go time you do not want to be this close absolutely not I'll do a quick demonstration you see what I mean now see what I want you to do and just hold up a finger okay hold up like this and whenever you see me move I just wanted you to do it do this yeah it's good for so this is a reaction time okay so try that okay one more time now so it's facing me this close okay now if I see me touch you I want you to do this try that okay okay now I'm not using a speed watch no speed I'm not using any speed and his reflex from here to here to react from his brain to be able to encounter and defend its animalistic because there's a lack time I'm not doing fast I'm not doing any speed no speed no I'm just doing this and you can see there's a delay and that's delay from him I'm throwing a strike to him to block something to do something to avoid and to counter that is stupid you do not want to do that that's why Jake Eid is a lot about preemptive strike I'm not counting I don't underestimate occur how do you know let's say you train three four five years how do we know this guy doesn't have more training on you how do you know he's not working out how do you know he doesn't have any background how do you know he doesn't have any military background how do you know you don't know anything so don't go into a fight way under your underestimate your opponent always assume this guy is faster is more this just is more powerful he has more speed he has better timing than you how can I beat the guy don't go in there I'm so good no problem you can hit me I can I can take this I could hit you back how the do you know how do you know don't do that always if your soup okay he's faster he's stronger he's smart got more experience I'm not gonna let him get this close well he gets close right I'm already Hey I'm hitting this stuff I don't even wanna take a chance cuz he pees in my a strong neck he can take this punch now take the chance I hit the throat I hit the eyes I know those he cannot train you cannot lift weight with your eyeball in your throat I know death sauce I don't give is 200 pounds I hit with my 14 I could do some serious damage so those are the three common mistakes in a street fight it is a little bit violent I understand but sometimes you got to protect yourself you have to go into a situation where you understand your well prepare and you smell lipstick that's the purpose of this right comment below let me know your thoughts or maybe what are the common mistakes I see people make in a street fight maybe you've seen it live in person maybe it's watch other YouTube videos comment below and if this is first time you're watching my video on my channel he just subscribe button we upload a video every single day a little martial video maybe once or twice a week

other videos maybe they would interest you as well until next time be water my friend", "8uuxCd4LhcA": "", "CrgMeLy6-mc": "", "xYemnKEKx0c": "So this story begins: I was at a friend\u2019s house She had on the library shelf a copy of the DSM manual Which is the diagnostic and statistical guide for mental illness. And it contains every mental illness that exists. In the past, in the 1950s, it was a small, thin booklet. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, Now it is a 886-page directory. It currently contains 374 mental illnesses. While I was reading it, I was wondering if you had any mental illness, It turns out that I have twelve of them. (Laughter) I have generalized anxiety disorder, This is necessarily known. I have nightmares disorder, Which is put under classification If you have frequent dreams that you will be pursued or declared to be a failure-- And all my dreams include people chasing me on the street Shouting \"You are a failure\" (Laughter) I have problems with the relationship between parents and the son, Which I blame my father for. (Laughter) I'm joking. I'm not kidding. I'm joking. And I have the disease. And I think it is a rare fact Have disease disease and generalized anxiety disorder, Because disease disease makes me feel very anxious. Whatever it was, I was looking through this book, Wondering if I was more crazy than I expected. Or maybe it is not a good idea to diagnose that you have any mental illness If you are not a trainer to work professionally in this field, Or maybe the psychiatrist profession has a strange desire To label what is considered normal human behavior as a psychological disorder. I didn't know which of these two things is correct, But I thought it was a rather interesting idea. And I thought maybe I was supposed to meet a psychiatric critic To get his point. So I ended up at the lunch table with one of the Scientologists. He is a man named Brian He runs a special operations team of Scientologists Determined to fight psychiatry, wherever it is. They call the CCHR So I told him, \"Can you prove it to me Psychiatry is a false science that cannot be trusted? \" He said: \"Yes, we can prove it to you.\" I said, \"How?\" He said: \"We will introduce you to Tony.\" I said, \"Who is Tony?\" He said: \"Tony is on Broadmoor.\" Now, what he means by Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It was known as the \"Broadmoor Sanctuary for Unreasonable Criminals\". There they send serial killers And people who are unable to help themselves. Then I said to Brian, \"What did Tony do?\" He said, \"Hardly anything. Hitting someone or something like that, Then he decided to claim madness to get out of prison. But he claimed madness very well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor No one can believe that he is sane. Would you like us to try and get you to Broadmoor to meet Tony? \" And then I said, \"Yes, please.\" So I took the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn irresistibly at Kempton Park, Apparently, this is what dogs do when they're anxious-- Irresistibly yawning. And we got to Broadmoor. I was taken through a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate followed by a gate To the recovery center Where you can meet patients. It looks like a giant hampton The whole place has peach and pine trees and its colors are comfortable. The only glaring colors are the red color of the emergency button. Patients began to move in. They were a little full and wore cotton sports shorts And they seem easy to comply. Brian whispered Scientology to me, \"They are under the influence of medicine,\" Which is considered to be the worst thing that could happen in the world. But what I thought was probably a good idea. (Laughter) Then Brian said: \"Here's Tony.\" There was a man walking inside. He did not look fat, his body looked very good. He was not wearing these cotton sports pants, He was wearing a striped suit. His arm was outstretched Like a man exited from \"The Apprentice\" He looked like a man wanting to dress up Convince me that he is very sane. Sat down. I said \"So, is it true that you occupied to reach here?\" He said: \"Yes, yes. Of course. I hit someone when I was seventeen. I was in prison awaiting trial, My cellmate told me, Do you know what to do? Call madness. Tell them you're crazy. They will send you to any of the many hospitals. Where the nurses will bring you some pizza. You will own your PlayStation. \" So I said, \"Well, how did you do that?\" He said, \"I asked to see a prison psychiatrist. And you've watched a movie called \"Crash\" Where people get sexual pleasure by bumping cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \"I get sexual pleasure from bumping cars into walls.\" So I said, \"And what else?\" He said, \"Oh, yes. I told the psychiatrist I want to see women die Because it makes me feel normal. \u201d So I said, \"Where did you get that from?\" He said, \"Oh, from Ted Pandey's autobiography That they had in the prison library. \" In any case, he claimed the disease very well as he put it They did not send him to Wathira Hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the moment he got to this place, He said he took one look at the place, asked to see a psychiatrist, He said: \"There has been a terrible misunderstanding. I am not mentally ill. \" I said, \"How long have you been here?\" He said, \"Well, if I had implemented the sentence I was sentenced to imprisonment for my original crime, I would have taken five years. I've been to Broadmoor for 12 years. \" Tony said it is very difficult to convince people that you are sane To convince them that you are crazy. He said: \"I thought it was the best way to look natural You may be by talking to people naturally about natural topics Like football or what is shown on TV. I am subscribed to \"New Scientist\", And recently it had an article How the American army was training hummingbirds to smell explosives. So I said to one of the nurses, \"Do you know that the US Army trains hummingbirds? To sniff out explosives? \" When I read the medical notes written about me, I found that they wrote: \"It is believed that bees can sniff out explosives.\" He said, \"You know, they are always looking for Non-verbal signs of my mental condition. But how do you sit sane? How to put a leg on the other in a rational way? It is impossible. \" And when Tony said that to me, I thought, \"Am I sitting like a journalist? Should I put one leg over another like a journalist? \" He said, \"You know, on the one hand, I have the tendencies of a serial killer like Stockwell Strangler The \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" usurper is on the other side. So I tend to sit in my room a lot because I find them terrifying. They consider sitting for a long time in the room as a sign of madness. They say that this proves that I am lonely and arrogant. \" So, only in Bordmore, the unwillingness to go out and walk around with the serial killers It is a sign of madness. Anyway, it seemed completely normal to me. However, what do I know? When I got home, I sent an email to his doctor, Anthony Madden. I said, \"What is the story?\" He said: \"Yes. We accept that Tony claimed the story of madness to get out of prison Because of his hallucinations, which seemed vulgar to start with Which disappeared the moment Broadmoor entered. However, we have evaluated it. We have decided that what he is is that he is upset. \" And in fact, fake the madness It is precisely the kind of cunning and manipulative behavior of the disordered. She is on the list; cunning and manipulative. So claiming that your mind has something wrong It is evidence that your mind already has something wrong. I talked to other experts, They have said that the striped suit - a classic disordered mind. Speaking of points one and two in the list of symptoms; Sweet-spoken, superficial personality charm and a transcendent sense of self-worth. I said, \"Well, he didn't want to mix with other patients?\" Classical disordered, this is evidence of great feeling as well as a lack of sympathy for others. Hence, all things that looked more natural in Tony It was evidence, according to his doctors, However, he was ill in this new way. He was disturbed. His doctor told me, If you wanted to know more about psychopaths, You can go to the Psychopathology Training Course Run by Robert Hare, the man who invented a list of psychopathic symptoms. And that's what I did I went to a psychopathic discovery course, And now I'm certified-- And I must say, I am very skilled-- As a discoverer of psychopaths. Here are the statistics: One in every hundred ordinary people is psychopathic. Well, there are 1,500 people in this room. Fifteen of you are psychopathic. Note that this number increases to 4 percent From executives and businessmen. So I think there is a very good opportunity There would be 30 or 40 psychopathies in this room. A massacre could happen at the end of this night. (Laughter) (laughter) So Herr said that capitalism is at its extreme Rewards psychopathic behavior-- Lack of sympathy for others, sweet talk, Sly, disingenuous. In fact, capitalism is in its cruelest brutality, It is a physical embodiment of psychopathology. It is like the type of psychopathic That is affecting all of us. Hare said to me: \"You know what? Forget this person in Broadmoor And who may, or may not be a paranoia. who cares? This is not an important story. The important story, he says, is \"they are psychopathic companies.\" You need to interview some psychopath companies. \" So I made an attempt. I addressed people at Enron. I said, \"Can I have an interview with you in prison To find out if you are psychopathic? \" They did not respond to me. So I changed the tactic this time. I sent an email to Dunlap \"Electric Saw\" Originated since the 1990s. He was involved in companies that fell and cut 30 percent of the workforce Simply referring entire American towns to ghost towns. I sent an email to him and said: \"I think you have a very rare brain defect That makes you special And interested in predatory spirit and not to fear anything. Can I do an interview with you? About your rare brain defect? \u200b\u200b\" He said: \"Come.\" Then, I went to the great Dunlap Palace in Florida Which was filled with sculptures of predators. There were lions and tigers. He was taking me through the garden. There were falcons and eagles. He used to tell me: \"There are sharks.\" He was saying this in a less sinister way. \"There are also more sharks and more tigers.\" It was like the Kingdom of Narnia. (Laughter) Then we entered his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlop was being brought in to rescue the companies that went bankrupt. He was laying off 30 percent of the workforce. And he would often fire people from joke, For example, one of the most famous stories about him, Someone came to him and said, \"I just bought a new car.\" He replied, \"Maybe you have a new car, But let me tell you what you don't have, job. \" Well, in his kitchen, he was standing there with his wife Judy And his bodyguard Sean. I told him, \"I remember how I told you in the email Could there be a rare defect in your brain that makes you unique? \" He said: \"Yes, it is an amazing theory. It's like Star Trek. You go where no one has seen you before. \" I said, \"Well, some psychologists might say This makes you ... \"(grunts) (Laughter) He said \"What?\" I said \"psychopathic.\" And then I said, \"I have a full list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I pass it on with you? \" And he seemed very interested against his will, And he said \"Okay, go ahead.\" I said, \"Okay, a transcendent sense of self-worth.\" And what I have to say is that it was difficult to deny it Because he was standing under a giant oil painting drawn to his person. (Laughter) He said, \"Well, you have to believe in yourself!\" I said \"manipulative.\" He said \"This is the leadership.\" I said \"shallow expressions: Inability to express the extent of feelings. \" He said, \"Who wants to be burdened with some trivial feelings?\" So, he was passing the points on the psychopathic list Mainly turning it into \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" (Laughter) But I noticed something that happened to me on the day I spent with the Dunlap. Whenever he told me something he looked normal For example, he answered \"No\" to juvenile delinquency. He said he was accepted to West Point, They do not accept people with a history of events at West Point. And none answered in short marital relations. He only got married twice in his life. Acknowledging that his wife mentioned in her divorce papers He once threatened her with a knife. He said that as long as he wondered what the taste of human flesh is, But people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages at the height of verbal quarrels His second marriage lasted for 41 years. So, whenever he tells me about something that might seem non-psychopathic, I say to myself, well I won't put this in my book. Then I realized that by being a psychopath observer It has turned me a little into psychopaths. Because I was striving to squeeze it into a box that reads psychopathic I was striving to know him as crazy as possible. Then I realized, my God. This is what I have been doing for 20 years. This is what all journalists do. We travel around the world with our paper notes in our hands And we are waiting for jewelry. And jewelry is always a ceiling In the characters we meet. And we sew them together like medieval monks. We leave natural things on the ground. This is one of the countries that diagnoses many mental illnesses far more than the reality. Bipolar disorder in children - children four years old They are classified as bipolar disorder Because they have tantrums, Which makes them score high on the list of bipolar disorder. When I returned to London, Tony phoned me. He said, \"Why didn't you answer my calls?\" I said, \"Well, they say you are psychopathic.\" He replied, \"I am not psychopathic.\" He said \"Do you know what? One of the paragraphs in the list is the lack of remorse, While the other one on the list is furtive, manipulative. When you say that you regret your crime, They say; exactly like psychopathy Cunningly claiming that he feels remorse while he is not. \" It's like magic. They turn everything upside down. He said \"I have a trial soon. Can you come to it? \" I said well Then I went to trial After 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go out. They decided that he was not supposed to be held indefinitely Because its high scores on a list Which could mean that he has above-average chances of a reversal. So they let him go out. And outside in the hallway he told me, \"Do you know what, John? \"All people are somewhat psychopathic.\" He said \"You. I. Well, obviously I am.\" I said \"What are you going to do now?\" He said: \"I will go to Belgium Because there is a woman there I dream about. But she is married, so I will make her separate from her husband. (Laughter) Whatever it was, this was two years ago, And here is where my book ended. In the last 20 months, everything was fine. No bad thing happened. He lived with a girl outside London. It was, according to Brian the Scientologist, It replaces the past time - which I know looks sinister, But it is not necessarily doomed. Unfortunately, after 20 months, He returned to prison for a month. He got into a fight in a bar, as he called it-- Which ended up going to prison for a month, Which I know is bad, But it is at least one month that means whatever quarrel, It was not so bad. Then call me on the phone. Do you know what? I think it is right for Tony to be outside. Because we are not supposed to know people about their craziest limits. And what Tony is on is that he's semi-psychopathic. It is a gray area in a world that does not like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find complexity, Where you find humanity And where you find the truth. Tony told me, John, can I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. \" I did not go. If you were me, what would you do? Thank you (clap)", "1RA2Zy_IZfQ": "you  I just want to say you know as somebody who also works in the fields of hypnosis and stage hypnosis I've always surprised by the way the general public sees it I would I believe that most people probably see hypnosis is really about you know turning people into chickens basically and another thing if you ask somebody who's a little bit let's say a little more paranoid that you'll find out that hypnosis is really about mind control and you talk to somebody who's a little more traditional and you'll find out that hypnosis is really about sin and something's quasi diabolical here's an example of a son Gally who is a 20th century film star who is a evil hypnotist now even among the scientific community there's been studies that show serious studies that show that there is no such thing as hypnosis that the hypnotic state does not actually exist and I think that even if you talk to let's say educated people such as yourselves that you'll find out when you boil it down that hypnosis appears to be some kind of magician's trick mind trick and that when you boil it down it's ultimately completely and totally fake now what if I said to you that if we don't understand hypnosis is it possible that we could be being hypnotized right now you basically don't know so I'm gonna make a suggestion let's call it a hypnotic suggestion i suggest you that hypnosis is entirely real in fact stage hypnosis is real and hypnotherapy is real here's an example of some of the many things that are treated with chemotherapy as well not only that but accelerated learning by hypnosis is real and the hypnotic bar as previously mentioned a bar where people are hypnotized to be completely drunk while they remain absolutely sober is also real hypno surgery where you can be operated on while completely awake is also real and of course absolutely that being turned into a chicken under hypnosis is also completely real maybe I could start off by saying there's good reason why we don't understand hypnosis and these are some of the reasons we go way back in time probably the first hypnotist were shamans aboriginal and native shamans here's an example a real example from 1914 but Shawna's generally didn't share their secrets there's one man who really put hypnosis on the map and that's this guy Anton Mesmer an Austrian doctor he was so influential that the word to be entranced to be mesmerised is from his name Mesmer Mesmer was the talk of paris and in the 1780s more than three thousand people a day would often go visit Mesmer to be healed he would do strange incantations he would appear to knock people out he would give them and hold them with magnets and thousands of people would come to see him regularly now this attracted the attention of the medical establishment of the time and they put pressure on the king of France Louis xvi who actually organized a Royal Commission to investigate Mesmer which was led by this guy Benjamin Franklin now the interesting thing about Benjamin Franklin is at that time he was the ambassador to France and also a great scientist and he and another group of scientific luminaries got together and they investigated Mesmer they concluded that there was nothing to Mesmer's claims that he was not really healing people and as a result Mesmer was treated and named a fraud and a charlatan in fact here's some popular artwork at the time that shows Mesmer being sent to the fires of obscurity by the light of Reason science and justice I would say that till this day as a result hypnosis hypnotism lives in the shadows in fact if you go to a bookstore often in North America or Canada and ask for books and hypnotism you'll usually be referred to the occult section so this is why hypnosis remains in the realm of the fake now if that's true if hypnosis is fake can I propose maybe a simple test that basically we perform right here this is a quasi scientific formula that we perform a series of very simple hypnotic inductions and maybe some hypnotic suggestions and we see what happens if if not if no if hypnosis is fake then nothing will happen if it's real then I guess we'll see is that okay  okay alright so if anybody is nervous and there always is a few people that are nervous I can suggest to you that you can avoid this process by simply ignoring my instructions for the next three minutes simply ignore my instructions and you'll be fine for the rest of you I'll just suggest you that right now you put your feet flat on the floor so focus on the center of the spiral and now I'll ask you to take a deep breath in take a deep breath in watch as the spiral moves very good and now take another deep breath in straight up towards the ceiling and now allow your eyes to just slowly blink on the count of three two one you can blink now very good and asking to blink one more time and blink now reopen your eyes and as you do as my hand drops you're gonna feel your eyes getting heavier your eyelids are going to get heavier heavier and a few seconds you'll just allow them to close three two one you can shut your eyes now beautiful as you close your eyes you get a very deep relaxed feeling and that allows you to feel like almost like your eyelids are melting into your cheeks you're so relaxed and calm and in fact your eyes are going to close tighter and tighter that they are now shut very good the more you try to open your eyes the more they will stay shut you can try to open your eyes but the more they stay shut and as few seconds I'll ask you to do a test and see if you can open your eyes but the more you try the more they are shut right now get anybody open their eyes very good now on the count of three you will be opened your eye you will be able to open your eyes if you can't let's go one two three now you can open your eyes beautiful who could not open their eyes just now who could not put up your hand if you don't mind could put up your hand okay good the people who could not open their eyes I miss gesture you come up on the stage for the next part of our experiment you could not open your eyes come on up the stairs are over there the stairs over there come on up you could not open your eyes very good people that are more hypnotizable are often more imaginative some of the greatest athletes in the world are very hypnotizable they're often strong and brilliant and beautiful as these people clearly are so now just gonna do a little bit of an experiment though if you guys don't mind so I'm just gonna ask you to stare at the light that little light at the end of the room right there very good now here's the interesting thing I didn't ask you sir just to put your hand out put your hand out and push down in my hand push down my hand harder harder harder sleep all the way in dropping down all the way relax and sleeping and ask you right back here very good I'm gonna ask you just to push your hands out like this very good don't worry don't worry feels good just push your hands up like this if you don't mind ready go take a deep breath in stare at that light you focus very good focus deeper three two one sip all the way and dropping down to sleep beautiful very good some people are not gonna react now just what your hands go down hand goes down up down and now sleep beautiful very good now this next person very good we do something this is a new induction that we developed for TEDx actually it's called a TEDx induction just stare at that spiral and ask you to put your hands up like this like an X that's right except facing the other way beautiful now stare at the light take a deep breath in and relax hands a little more straight very good as it cut me down it lets you didn't notice that your heart is beating because you're on stage all these people are looking at you look at the light and just focus on the light take a deep breath in relax them sleep all the way in very good rock them down all the way very good relax and calm now  I'll explain I'll explain in a second okay sir same thing push your hands out like this deep breath in just watch my hand go down just watch it right here go down down down down sweep all the way up drop him down all the way very good excellent shake your hand breath in and sleep all the way and drop him down all the way very good person okay right now I'm gonna say a word when you understand what that word means it's gonna happen to you you understand so just there at that spiral Sara that lights why right there and I say the word SL e t sleep beautiful very good excellent person I'm just gonna ask both you to stick your hands up like this both of you deep breath in stare at the spiral and everybody sweep all the way up very good nothing a beautiful and you can just rock down and sleep it's okay very good excellent  you're so amazing and just say sleeping's gonna happen very good dropping down excellent I'm gonna leave these people up here so you can experience are you okay for being up okay so what these people are experiencing is something that we call hypnotic sleep hypnotic sleep is actually they appear to be sleeping but I'm gonna suggest you that that is not true they are not actually sleeping here's some examples and they show some examples if not its sleep so here's some examples of hypnotic sleep and one of the reasons why we don't understand hypnotic sleep is we tend to focus on the hypnotist and not the people who are actually sleeping so now I'm gonna go a little bit closer take a look I'm gonna suggest to you that these people are in a very interesting state now do they look like they're sleeping and I'm gonna suggest to you that they are actually awake and alert if you can hear my voice and you know what's going on you have the power to lift a finger on your right hand you can do that now if you can hear my voice you can lift a finger on your right hand now beautiful take a deep breath in and relax and now go back to sleep beautiful relaxing all the way they are actually still here they haven't gone anywhere I'm going to suggest to you that right now these people are in a state that is akin to what you might call sleep paralysis sleep paralysis is a state where we feel like we are sleeping but actually every night when you go to sleep you become paralyzed by your own body so that if you dream that you are running or falling or jumping you don't actually jump out of your bed or run out of your bed so this state is right now sleep paralysis you notice that people are quite relaxed and limp okay so let's do a little bit of an experiment let's do a bit of an experiment right now and I'm going to suggest at this point that people are very open to suggestions so maybe I'll start with this fellow read here when you hear the word hypnotism person I'm touching me now when you hear the word hypnotism you will shout it's fake when you hear the word hypnotism you will shout it's fake when you hear the word hypnotism you will start laughing you will shout I am in complete control of all my actions do a bit of an experiment and I must try something else there probably people in the audience right now that are actually in trance so I can ask you to take a deep breath in anybody the audience and you can go right back to sleep beautiful anyone the audience is relaxed and sleepy so anyone in the audience who hears the word hypnotism will also shout it's fake okay very good so now coming back into the room feeling refreshed and relaxed remaining in trance on the count of three two one when I snap my fingers now when I am talking right now about hypnotism fake what I'm trying to illustrate is that something hypnotism is not it's not it's not well understood okay it's not well understood what do you think of hypnotism big if I could just ask this person for a second what do you think of it clearly clearly you do now I'm going to show you something in my right hand I have a sleep gun this is a gun it cannot hurt you but when I shoot you with this gun you're gonna go right back into a deep and relaxing sleep on the count of three two one bang sleep and bang sleep and bang sleep very good so these people are in a very relaxed state these are sort of our all-stars here now I suggest you there's something very interesting going on with these people and it's something if you want to look at it it's actually in the eyes now I don't know if you can see it clearly but you see this person right here can you see it their eyes are actually flickering now why would their eyes are flicking on to suggest something interesting that their eyes are actually rolled up in their heads now why would that happen isn't that kind of weird and I'm going to suggest you let's go back to our friend the shaman look at the shaman his eyes are also rolled up you can look at here is it a little bit closer you can see a little bit closer and now let me show you something else that sometimes when people are in this state you can see his eyes are flickering the people are in this state that they they sometimes remain with their eyes open that looks a little bit like this now look a little bit closer and of course we get an effect that looks almost diabolical in fact this is straight out of the Exorcist and it may explain this stereotype so now let me show something let's go back right here and let me suggest to you that there's probably a reason why this state actually occurs and maybe I'll start with this person right here that is it possible that the original hypnotist to use the stereotype of hypnotist somebody uses a pendulum that goes back and forth but that pendulum going back and forth is doing something particular to the eyes let's do a little bit an experiment this is a induction developed by Mike Mandel a Canadian hammer test I can ask you man if you don't mind if you can just sit up for a second I snap my fingers you can sit up now I'm just gonna ask you just to look at my finger right watch it keep your head steady and watch it go back forth back forth your eyes get heavier and a few seconds they will just close back forth now you can just go relax to sleep beautiful look at her eyes are flickering so she has entered a state and I hope that this is kind of sciency she's entered a state that is very similar to REM now is it possible that what hypnosis is doing is jump-starting the actual REM State now to show you perhaps an interesting example of why this must mat might matter let me show you a video take a look at this [Music]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause] [Music]  so I know that's a pretty ridiculous video but let me explain this actually something very profound going on here and that is there's actually a veterinarian rodent wrote an article for the newspaper that explained that what's actually going on here is that cats are actually reliving traumas they're not but here's the weird thing why are cats afraid of cucumbers because cucumbers remind them of what or look like what snakes exactly they look like snakes but hold on a second with domestic cats in North America or in Kingston anywhere like that would they ever encounter a snake no never so why would domestic cats all seemingly be programmed to already be afraid of snakes that they've never met the explanation very simply is that professor Michel Juba experimental medicine the University of Lyon the sixties did a series of experiments he's called the Christopher Columbus of dreams and his theory is that mammals are all mammals while they're in the womb basically enjoy a powerful REM state a dream state that dream state may be essential to programming us to be what we are so cats would be programmed to be afraid of snakes while in the womb that would be an explanation for why they are now afraid of cucumbers even though they never encounter snakes that make sense so now is it possible that hypnosis is us hacking in to this actual dream state and let's take a look here's a here's a here's a common experiment you probably remember the movie the matrix and the matrix neo is programmed to know kung fu it's advanced technology helps them know kung fu and I'm going to suggest to you that we can do something like that today I'll take this person right here you are a kung fu master now and you're going to demonstrate a new form of kung fu in the red dot known as TEDx a powerful dramatic form of kung fu you will always remain safe and you will not push your body beyond its known limits you are also a kung fu master you will perform an even more dramatic form known as TEDx squared you will also always remain safe and you will perform your kung fu exhibition right after the first one so I can ask this person to come back to the room in the count of three two one mice at my fingers please meet the master of Kung Fu right now sure you want demonstrating the rare and beautiful TEDx form  hi what he cook  Sara coming back to the room now you are a kung-fu master you will beat that come that incredible demonstration that you only heard you're going to perform this is the form now known as TEDx squared  thank you now I want to take us from in conclusion maybe back to the the chicken what is really truly amazing actually is that when I do hypnosis shows I used to avoid ever turning people into chickens because it's cliche and silly but then I actually learned something amazing when you do the research there's something amazing about people being chicken so I'm gonna do a demonstration deep breath and relax and sleep beautiful maybe Tara you can go read like to sleep beautiful very good you are a chicken Peck and you say macaw you do all the chickeny things you are a chicken that's right you do all the chickeny things you're a great amazing chicken you madam are a cat you are cat and you're very much like a cat now [Applause] chickens can come out you can step up here now one thing about chickens and cats  [Laughter] [Applause]  now I'll just ask you remind you as chickens and cats you have been programmed to be mortally afraid of cucumbers if you see an image if you see a picture or an image of a cucumber you will scream you will scream anyone sees a picture of a cucumber here will scream now cat do you see the chickens sure do you see the chickens  [Applause]  now I'm going to ask all of you you don't mind to direct your attention to the screen  [Applause]  sorry ok ok it's alright it's alright it's alright go back to your you can go back to your that's right you can go back I'm gonna make a suggestion now [Applause]  here's a simple demonstration of hypnotherapy now when you see a cucumber you will no longer scream you will only laugh you'll laugh incredibly hard you'll be unable to stop laughing now  [Laughter] [Applause]  [Laughter] very good you can have a seat right now so I'm gonna give you Tara I'm gonna give you the sleep gun here's a gun and what we do take this gun I want you to shoot the cat over there I want you to shoot him he won't be hurt you're gonna go into a deep relaxed state and then I'm gonna ask you to shoot yourself okay and go into a deep and relaxed state so here's a sleep gun right now you can just make a loud bang that's all shoot the cat over there if you don't mind go into a deep relaxed state and sleep beautiful very good when you shoot him he'll go into a deep relaxed state very good  okay now I know that we all laugh at the guy and has stands for the person that becomes a chicken but actually this shows a very profound and amazing aspect of humanity humans have the ability unlike other mammals apparently to dream just about anything we can imagine ourselves as chickens as aliens as any kind of weird associated thought or or feeling and that really shows why humans have such a powerful and it's a sonnet to some extent limitless imagination I'm going to suggest to you that hypnosis itself remains completely uncharted it is still misunderstood and that the state that these people are in when they come out of the state they're going to feel wonderfully refreshed and relaxed that's because with hypnosis we hack into the fundamental programming state which also happens to be a state that is itself tremendously recuperative this dreaming state is tremendously recuperative and healthy and you're going to see these people will come out of it feeling very healthy relaxed and clear so in conclusion I wish want to say hypnosis is not the preserve of hypnotist or hypnotherapist even it is the common massive and amazing inheritance of all humanity and that's something that the world needs to know so in conclusion the people that are in a hypnotic state and the people that includes the people in the audience if you're hypnotized in a few seconds you'll come back into the room you're going to feel refreshed and relaxed and wonderful you've done an amazing job you're really incredible and magical when you come back in the room you're gonna feel refreshed relax no longer hypnotized there's only one catch you'll have no idea what happened while you were on this stage you will forget everything that happened to you on this stage until you hear me say the word fake then everything will come flooding back to you you remember everything and you will laugh okay so I would just like to say in conclusion I hope today that I have demonstrated that hypnosis is totally and completely fake  thank you very much [Applause] [Music]  you  [Music]", "G2A-185WViw": "", "WdhQ5mM_Giw": "", "q_z-9Xr8SZM": "after another huge month of boxing we take a turn from fights that could be to look at a few mishaps from the past that serve as a lesson to both present and future fighters a swift reminder that as we know you don't play boxing and so unlike a through the leg dribble in basketball or a step-over in football there are a few pretty obvious reasons that most should avoid showboating inside the squared circle  whilst Roy Jones rooster punch Ali's shuffle and Hammad's Lohan's all made for incredible viewing a short lapse in concentration for a lesser fighter could have devastating consequences  when she did here we look at five high-profile occasions where the showboating went very wrong welcome to a motive PDF presentation we'll start with the most recent where we head to Leicester England a vacant WBO title bout that became a viral sensation for one clear reason  Maxwell Maxwell and Sudhir II both entered the ring with almost identical ten and records in the early rounds the Frenchman seemed to be getting the better of Maxwell putting him down in the first and second surviving and early scare the Britt looked to regain some control though was seemingly on his way to a clear points loss that was however until the tenth and final round Sudhir he landed a clean few shots which led to careless showboating and dancing around the ring in pantomime fashion he had little hands chin exposed and with just 14 seconds to go Maxwell landed the shot of his career  a night that echoed a brutal reminder to fight until the final bell and then it's not over until it's Oh [Applause]  next we take a trip back 4 years ago to a night in Orlando Florida [Music] Felix beer dae-ho two years into his professional career and 14 and Oh at the time an Olympic quarter finalist who lost out the Lomo changer the Dale is not bad at all nice style talks up pretty good and with the warning signs of having ten knockouts already on his resume his opponent appeared to show little concern  happy to trade with the Puerto Rican it made for an exciting matchup early off  however only three rounds into the fight the gravity of the situation seemed to dawn on the Mexican landing more and more cleanly Verdejo took control avoiding a shot in one of those poker face Bluff moments Villanueva dropped his hands and taunted his opponent needless to say just five seconds later it came back to haunt him [Applause]  some of you love and some of you hate him but you know what just like boys mayweather he evokes emotions eight months prior at the end of 2013 we revisit that unforgettable night in Texas Adrien Broner 28 and Oh looked to be on the path to superstardom however against the rugged and heavy-handed Argentinian came the rude awakening that many believed he needed December 14th we weren't about Maidana you know um I respect this coach I respect him as a fighter but December 14 mama beat his ass though swarmed from the opening bell Maidana put pressure on him immediately and in a moment of disrespect Broner taunted his opponent at the end of the first another gesture which would come back to haunt him later in the punishing to the body and head Maidana landed the left hook in the second that floored Broner for the first time in his career and despite seeming to recover mid fight round eight saw another looping left hook send him down  knocked out twice yeah black power winning by unanimous decision came a satisfying victory for the Argentinian and watching Broner leave the ring without congratulation or being interviewed was clearly a huge reality check for the American okay you know it happens to the best of them in and it doesn't eat even as of right now I'm still one of the best moving back still we remind another 18 months to Quebec Canada at the Bell Centre in front of 15,000 fans the unbeaten bootay came in against Olympic bronze medalist Edison moraga you know I don't think they need to count loans and it's neat to make sure that they win the fight looking this sharper and smarter fighter bouquet looked comfortable during the first couple of rounds moving well and unloading flurries of punches where his Colombian opponent looked to land power shots frustrated and having little success me Rhonda tried to get into his opponents head taunting bouquet at the ending bell of the first been carelessly dropping his hands in the third and just like the fighters featured previously we know how this ends hands on hips stood up straight Miranda suffered a careless lapse of concentration and false confidence regaining stance and walking forwards he found himself immediately on the receiving end of a vicious left  [Music] and did not see that coming didn't expect it yeah they love  [Music] last up a night 15 years ago in California that saw the collision of two solid lightweights two fighters that had been beaten previously but still had a lot at stake in what was always destined to be an all-action fight the pace was high from the get-go despite landing some crisp flurries of punches early on Hayden saw himself fading in the middle rounds as Campbell the bigger puncher of the two looked to be capitalizing piling on the fresh searching in five looking to be on his way out Hayden was caught with a sickening body shot doubling over in obvious pain  knowingly hurt kampl grew more and more confident with little return fire coming his way just 20 seconds later the American dropped his hands playing with his opponent and right on cue the Australian unloaded the biggest left hook of his career  another instance where one single punch and split second reaction can completely flip a fight on its head played with his opponent who's completely confident with his hands down hit right on the chin with a perfect left hook and with  five harsh reminders that boxing is not for the faint-hearted and that no matter the circumstances to fight to the final peg regularly we see fighters take matters into their own hands though with the continued revival of the flashy style displayed by fighters like lomachenko Kelly and Saunders comes the harsh reality of what could happen in a moment of negligence [Applause]

from a woman winning a million dollars and not telling her husband about it two people that won big and blew it all on cars and drugs we take a look at 15 stupid lottery winners number 15 Denise Rosie when Denise Rosie won the California lotto to the tune of 1.3 million dollars she did not wish to share it with her then husband Thomas she left her husband without a word of her winning and despite him thinking that something was fishy Thomas agreed for a divorce as fate would have it Thomas came about the truth and filed a lawsuit against ex wife Denise now since we all know that greed never pays it's no surprise that Thomas won the case and without even purchasing a lotto ticket the lucky guy got every single cent of his ex-wife's winnings number 14 Michael Carroll when Michael Carroll won the 2002 jackpot in England he quickly came to be known as the lotto lout he went on a crazy binge of purchasing houses and cars as expected of most lotto winners but he took his overindulgence a tad bit too far when he used the backyards of those very same houses as open areas to hold demolition derbies that featured the cars he had bought we already know that he would end up in jail and end up penniless soon enough that's exactly what happened enough said number 13 Etta may or kuu heart California's Etta may or kuu heart after playing the lottery for over 18 years actually won the jackpot she was hit by a fit of nerves as she couldn't stop shaking when she went to claim her prize she asked her son Ronny to sign the ticket and claim the jackpot on her behalf greed however can overpower even the closest of relations and to ed his disbelief Ronny claimed the jackpot as his own and went on a spending spree with the money he had claimed number 12 Timothy Elliot Timothy Elliot had always wanted to win the lottery at any cost and he was caught in an armed robbery once which he only undertook in order to get money to buy lottery tickets during his trial for the same he was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder and hence the court put him on probation with mandatory mental counselling instead of sending him to jail the terms of his probation were the usual no drugs no gambling and no getting into any trouble when he finally lucked out in 2011 and won his million dollars he was arraigned for breaking the terms of his probation thankfully the court asked him to make a moderate restitution and let him keep the rest of his winnings number 11 Ian Gault hrus we have heard about all the stories out there where lottery winners have misplaced their winning tickets only to have to go on a massive treasure hunt to retrieve them most of them claim to have rifled through their trash retrace their steps and even went so far to turn their houses upside down and search for them Ian gouges an engineer from Merseyside faced the very same emotions when he realized that he had lost his winning 1 million pound lottery ticket how did he know for sure well because he had purchased another ticket for his girlfriend and it was just one digit away from his which of course turned out to be the winning one when he had lost him number 10 Americo Lopes greed is always the precursor for a case of breach of ethics and that's what happened with Americo Lopes construction company worker Americo was delighted when he won the lottery in 2010 he immediately quit his job on the pretext that he required foot surgery while none of this appeared suspicious for a person who had just won Millions it was only months later when his co-workers filed a lawsuit against him that things became clearer it seems that all the workers in the company usually pooled their money together in order to buy lottery tickets and it was on one such cash pool that yielded the winning ticket number 9 Vivian Nicholson of course everyone that wins a lottery jackpot wants to spend and spend and spend and when Britain's Vivian Nicholson won the lottery in 1961 her very very public exclamations that she was going to spend it all seemed very apt but of course no one thought that the lady would literally go ahead with her plans to such an extent that would run through her millions in just a matter of years rather than keeping aside some of the cash for rainy days or investing at least part of it on her future Vivian blew it all on how to tour Vivian was soon jobless alienated from her friends and a widow number 8 William Budd post William Budd post was unfortunately the victim of the common phenomenon that lottery winners have to go through family members coming out of the woodwork assuming that they are entitled to a chunk of the cash for no reason other than that they're related when post 116 point 2 million in the lottery his girlfriend sued him for some of his winnings actually winning her case his brother attempted to hire a hitman to kill him so that he could get the money for himself it was unsuccessful but still crazy his other siblings persuaded him to make bad investments that left him 1 million dollars in debt and living off Social Security checks at the time of his death number 7 Jeffrey Dampier Jeffrey Dampier had good intentions with his money he really did once he won about 20 million dollars from the Illinois Lottery he actually invested it in a gourmet popcorn store called Cassie's gourmet popcorn his sister-in-law along with her boyfriend who undoubtedly had dollar signs in his eyes shot Dan Pierre in the back of the head with a shotgun seven years after he won and then left him in the back of a van intending to take his money they were obviously caught however and convicted of murder and now they're both in jail for life number 6 Alex a sope Alex is Soak won about $500,000 in the lottery to benefit his nonprofit organization a group that aided victims of sexual abuse but Alex's soap was a sexual offender himself he molested two girls under the age of 13 one in 1993 and one in 2000 and no one actually knew this until he won the jackpot and the media dug up the info not too long later a soap was attacked while walking down the street and hit repeatedly in the head with a pipe that left him severely injured number 5 Evelyn Adams winning the lottery once is one thing the odds are astronomical at best normally if it does happen to a person it never happens again for Evelyn Adams of New Jersey however it did happen twice in 1985 and 1986 she won about 5.4 million in total and instead of thinking that maybe it was a sign that she should put it away or invest it in something Adams thought it'd be a great idea to spend it all gambling in nearby Atlantic City a little over 20 years later she found herself broke in living in a less than lavish trailer park number 4 honda lynn former Waffle House waitress Honda Lynne thought she could easily get away with keeping her millions from being shared with two of her waitress colleagues when the three of them had verbally agreed to share the winnings if any of them ever won from tickets that they got his gifts from the joints patrons since verbal agreements related to gambling do not hold up in court she did win the case that her colleagues filed against her number three Callie Rogers when Callie Rogers was 16 she was just another normal teen living in the UK then she won the lottery about 1.9 million if you're currently thinking that 16 is far too young to be dealing with that much money at once you are completely right because shortly after receiving her cash prize Callie went on a spending spree and threw her hardly hard-earned cash at everything from clothes to vacations to parties to breast enhancements oh and cocaine lots and lots of cocaine which is a pretty expensive drug so you can kind of see why she's on this list number two Jeanette Lee when the 52 year old wig shop owner from st. Louis Jeanette Lee won 18 million dollars in 1993 she initially spent it on all the usual stuff later though she went on a philanthropic binge that went unchecked still she had lost everything and had to file for bankruptcy the South Korean immigrant took her donations to educational programs community services and political organizations a tad bit too far number one Amanda Clayton Amanda Clayton was arrested for welfare fraud when it came to everyone's noticed that she'd still been collecting her welfare checks even when she had a million dollars in her bank account you either have to be too greedy to give up on welfare coupons even though you're rich now or too stupid to notice the welfare coupons you still continue to get she got five years in jail but that didn't kill her though a drug

I'm Jesse from KARATEbyJesse.com, aka The Karate Nerd, and today I am joined by the one and only Sensei Bill \"Superfoot\" Wallace. Thank you so much Sensei for joining us today. - Thank you sir, my pleasure. - So, what many people might not know is that you were actually the commentator of the very first UFC fightl. - Yes Could you take us there, bring us behind the scenes and tell us what actually went on in the early beginnings of the UFC. - What happened is Rorion Gracie, the father, calls me up and he says, \"Bill, we would like you to commentate at \"our first, you know, fighting championships.\" - Yeah. - And I went, \"Whoa, well, yeah I could do that, no problem. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s gonna go well, \"because the martial artists are not in, \"they like the kickboxing part of it, \"but they didn\\'t like the grappling part of it, \"and so sure, I\\'ll do that, \"\\'cause you\\'re paying me a lot of money.\" - Okay, yeah. - So, I go and I show up, I'm with Jim Brown, the American Football player, and Kathy Long, who was also a lady kickboxer. - Yeah. - So, we're sittin' there, we're going over it, now, there's no pre runs or anything, we're just, I get there on Friday and the thing happens on Saturday. So they have the meeting and there are no rules, the two rules were: you can't stick your fingers in a guys' eye and you can't kick him in the groin. - Right. - That's the two rules. I went, okay. - Interesting. - Yup yup. And, the participants could not wear hand wraps. - No. - Could not wear leg wraps, and just like it was. They had to wear a mouthpiece 'cause-- - Okay. - It protects the teeth. - Groin cup? - Yeah. - Okay. - And when the fights happened, I'd have a guy sitting beside me, from the Gracie Jiu-jitsu, telling me what to say about the Gracie's. - Oh right. - So it's to push the Gracie's. So basically I'm thinking oh, something doesn't sound right here. Seems to me like it's a two hour advertisement for Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, which is what it turned out to be. I mean, Royce did a fantastic job, don't get me wrong, He didn't punch anybody, - No. - He didn't kick anybody, - No. - He just got 'em down, took 'em down with a double every time was a double leg takedown, and he choked 'em out. - No one barged, choked all of 'em out. And the first time I said, \"Okay,\" and I think it was Royce's second match against Ken Shamrock. - Yeah. - They're fighting and Ken Shamrock jumped in for a double leg takedown. - Yeah. - And Royce reaches under his belt and grabs his own belt. - Right. - And chokes Ken Shamrock out. - Okay. - Ken Shamrock chokes. - Yeah, yeah. - Taps out. They get up, \"You can\\'t do that, you can\\'t do that!\" and finding out was Ken Shamrock accused him, which is rightfully so, - Yeah. - That you can't reach under, grab the belt, - Okay. - And choke me out with your own belt. - Yeah. - Well yes you can because, as we know in martial arts training, - Yeah. - Our uniform is also a weapon. - Right, so that was allowed according to the rules? - Yeah, Ken Shamrock wasn't for it, he was upset. - Right. - But he lost. - Right. - And then, you know, then Royce just went through their belts, choking everybody out. - Right. - Behind him, choke out. - Yeah. - But just, you know, choking out. - Exactly. So are you saying they kind of organized this thing? I don't want to say it's a conspiracy theory but-- - No it wasn't, it just-- - Was it like a marketing stunt, almost? - I guess you could say that. - For the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu system? - Oh sure. - Yeah. - 'Cause they pick the fighters. - Oh really? - Rorion Gracie picked the fighters. - So they probably picked fighters that would look good against Brazilian. - Of course they would. - Because you've got the stand-up, the hands are here. - Right. - How easy now is it for you to drop down into your double leg takedown? - Double, yeah. - 'Cause they've never seen it before. - They had never seen that takedown before. - They're stand-up fighters. - Exactly. - So they have no idea how to even react to it. The boxer didn't even throw a punch. (Jesse laughs) The boxer never threw a punch. - They're just shooting for the double leg. - (mumbles) Took him down and that was it. And what I don't understand too is that they had a big sumo wrestler. - Oh yeah, right. - Excuse me. (Jesse laughs) What's the job of a sumo wrestler? To push you out of a circle about this size. - Right. - I push you out, I win. He doesn't know how to strike. - No. - He doesn't know how to kick. - No. - He doesn't know how to choke or arm bar, he just pushed you out of a ring. It's a closed ring, you can't get out of there. - Right. - So what are you gonna do, push him against a wall until he suffocates or something? (Jesse laughs) And I'm sure that's what he wanted to do, get him down, lay on top of him. - Yeah, yeah. - So what happens is this kid from the Netherlands. - Yeah. - Just nails him. He comes in (mumbles) the guy drops down to his knees. - Yeah. - And the guy from the Netherlands, I can't remember his name, just nails him right in the face with a roundhouse kick. - Right. - And a tooth goes flying over my head. - Oh! - I went (mumbles) then he steps down and the kid's still sitting there. Punches him right in the mouth. Now, the kid from the Netherlands broke his foot, - Really? - And then broke his hand on the kid's face. - Oh! - But they stopped the match. - Yeah. - Now, I don't know why because he wasn't hurt, bleeding a little bit, but he wasn't hurt. The guy was 350 or should be 400 and something pounds. Hell, this guy is like a log! (Jesse chuckles) So he wasn\\'t hurt, he said, \"Why are you stopping the fight? \"Why are you stopping?\" Only because he knocked a tooth out. But he was okay. - Yeah. - So there's another conspiracy. - Right. - Because now you're saying, just a minute. - Right. - If this guy can hit this guy with his best shot, two best shots, and nothing happened, what happened? How's Royce gonna take him down? - Oh! - Royce is gonna get dropped down for the double leg. - Yeah. - Or he just fans out on his back. (choking noises) Now he, Royce is on his stomach flattened out, this guy is going. - Yeah. (choking noises) - So they wanted him out? - Sure. - Yeah. - And then one of the guys who was a really good boxer, really good puncher, asked him not to use the smoke because he had asthma. - Okay. - So they used the smoke anyway. We're coming out there, 'bout halfway through the match (heaving noises) - Oh, so like smoke machines? - Sure. They go, now hold on just a minute. (Jesse laughs) What the hell's going on here? (stutters) So there's eight guys, which means there's seven fights. - Yeah. - Right. Four, two, then one right? - Right. - And you go, okay what the heck's going on here? But I never thought it would be as popular as it was. - No? - No, I never did. - How come? - Because the first time I saw it I didn't like it. - No? - The first time I saw it I said, \"What, that\\'s bull!\" Because, number one, Royce never threw a kick. He threw one kick to keep the guy away from him. Never threw a punch, just standing there like this. Drops down, and Gracie was the only one, the only one that was allowed to wear a uniform. The other guys couldn't even wrap their hands, but he was allowed to go in the uniform. - So when they couldn't wrap their hands, they can barely punch full contact? - Exactly. And you got guys that, because you're, \"Oh I want to wrap my knees.\" \"No you can\\'t wrap your knees.\" But Royce is allowed to wear all that stuff, yes. So, you go, hold on, what, I don't understand this. And I think the reason I wasn't invited back, one of the reasons because there are several-- - Oh, so you were not invited back? - No. I asked too many questions. (Jesse laughs) I said: \"Why don\\'t you have a regular wrestler there?\" A wrestler that knows how to defend against-- - Oh, there was no wrestler? - Nope. There was six strikers, strikers, Royce and the sumo wrestler. - So it sounds to me like it was basically set up for a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. - Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong, they all had their chance to win. - Sure. - But Royce knows how to defend that. But this is 1993. - And they didn't know how to defend that. - They didn't know how to defend against a takedown. Even though you say, \"Well I\\'ve practiced,\" no you haven\\'t. Not against a guy that knows how to do the takedown. - Yeah, exactly. - So, Royce was the reason, the first one he won, the second one he won, the third one where they changed the rules a little bit because the time, it was taking too long. - Ah, I see. - And on the third one he had the Grand Championship Master between Ken Shamrock and Royce, rematch it might say. Shamrock shot him with a punch right here, split him wide open, but it didn't do anything, all it did was cut him and so they finally called it a draw because it was ... - But that's how Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu became so famous! Because it looked so effective. - Well, they keep saying most fights end up on the ground. - Yeah, I hear that all the time. - Well all fights start standing up. - That's true. - All fights start standing, so if I stand up and I'm from me to her, she's gotta come close to me before she can do anything, before she can punch me, before she can kick me, before she can do a takedown, right? - Exactly. - That gives me the chance to counter. Well, they're not used to that because if I'm standing right here and I do this, you've got to put your hands up and I drop ready for the double leg. That's what they do and the stand-up fighters, naive, that they are, they say, \"Well when he stops \"then I\\'ll just punch him in the mouth.\" No you won't, because I'll do this first. You put your hands up and then I'll drop down. - Yeah, exactly. Well it worked very well because now Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the world's largest, most popular martial arts. - But what did they have to do? They had to learn to strike. Because remember, we learned how to defend against it. - Exactly. - So they had to learn how to strike to get in there. - Especially against a wrestler who knows the double leg takedown, who knows the defense. - In wrestling the double leg is the first takedown you're taught. It's also the first takedown you learn to defend. - Imagine if a wrestler had been invited to the first UFC. - Imagine that, imagine. - And if that wrestler knew a little bit of striking so he could do ground and pound, for example. - Imagine that. - Maybe the whole martial arts world would look different. - Imagine that. (Jesse laughs) - Wow. - They're in the process now of even trying to get rid of wrestling in the Olympics. - Oh is that so? - Yeah. It was the very first one, it was in the very first Olympics back in somebody AD. So think about this. If they want to get rid of wrestling, then how many people will not be using wrestling techniques but the Gracie's still will. - Exactly. So you could say they have something of an unfair advantage. - Well, no, they know what they're doing. They know how to work the chokes, they know how to work the arm bars, they know how to work, most of them now have learnt the striking aspect of it. - Yeah, exactly. - The speed aspect of it. - And they manage to combine that. - And they don't mind you taking them down because now even though you're on top I'm in the on guard position to where I've got my legs wrapped around you and pretty soon you get frustrated, you reach, I get the arm. You reach, I get the neck. (background shouting) (Jesse chuckles) So what happens is UFC now. - Exactly. So what do you think, looking at the first UFC to all the way, looking at the evolution of it, comparing that to today. - Oh it's 100% different. - It is? - Sure. Because the rules have changed. Now there are rules, before there were none, remember? Now, it's a funny thing, that if I'm on the ground I can kick you in the face but you can't kick me at all. - Exactly. (chuckles) - You can't punch me in the back of the head. Why? - One might argue that those rules favor a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. - Shame on you Jesse! (Jesse laughs) You shouldn't talk like that, but again it's the, and I hate to use the term sport of it, you know. I mean, it's like two gladiators out there fighting. Except this time, hopefully, the loser doesn't die. - Exactly, yeah. - I don't like to watch it because I hate that term ground and pound. Think about it, ground and pound, what does that say to you? You get a guy on the ground, you beat him until he says: \"I quit.\" Well, that doesn't even happen out on the street. There's gonna be somebody who's gonna pull you off. I don't know, just me, I like to kick people. (laughter) - All right, thank you so much Sensei. - Thank you. - For sharing that amazing...", "rStsx8SGsPc": "arabiska", "rjZEDmLtDr4": "[Music]  [Music] hey my name is Victor marks it's great to be here with you this is our first video for you - that's instructional and I want to say thank you to all of our subscribers and today I think we're over 12 million views on our channel so thank you for that I'm gonna be demonstrating how not to get knocked out there's tons of different ways fighting styles techniques all of that and you know what most of them are good but not all of them work okay so we're very pragmatic and realistic about self-defense we teach a style called Kate judo but I'm not here to promote the style I'm here to help you keep from getting knocked out I'm he's one of my top black belts mr. Jeff Brothers and we're just demonstrating this first of all positioning when somebody's coming up on you never keep your hands down that's a good way to get knocked out because some people are very fast and slick and pop you get down and you won't get back up for a while so if anybody is in a posture that's aggressive just put your hands either go hey man calm down calm down now a lot of people specially they go tell fighters they have a hard time with keeping the hands open because it makes them feel like well this ain't really I just want to knuckle it up but you still can but we're doing this for two reasons one if you have to defend yourself what's it doing this and this well it's about a millisecond when you go like this boom boom and fatale knock him out but you need witnesses that are gonna say well you know the Smurfs grandpa dude his hands were open and then you know the black ranger ha ha you know doctor destroyer he was just aggressive so that's what they're gonna say in court and on the police report okay so we're just being realistic so hey man calm down calm down all right now the positioning of my hands I'll give you a little different angle come here for a second I want to put one hand up by his face other hand like this ah I want to keep this arm up a little bit and this arm is gonna be just stay here and let me tell you why the most common type of punch is a right hook punch haymaker whatever you say generally speaking the person wants to knock you out that's the stock out punch okay so since we know that we're gonna keep my hands up so we don't get knocked down okay the first thing we do is we know he's probably gonna throw that this money time come through a jab because my hands right there but if the guy is just swinging for your head we're gonna put our hands behind our head just like this grab tight just like that on this side we're gonna put this hand here to protect our face just like this we call this turtling up it looks like this boom it looks like this boom my hands are here hey man calm down whoa just like that alright if he hits anything here on the elbow boom ricochet up the end don't don't do like this boom and keep that down cuz he'll connect so one two you got this elbow here this one we're gonna do is actually wrap around the arm just like that to neutralize it behind the elbow you get in front of it he'll jerk it out and then you're gonna get tagged so one two wrap put my head real tight here just like this just like this now look he'll try to pull it out that's the number one a heavy costume they'll be screaming they go my god don't let it go okay so you're gonna ride it out like this  just gonna come on you finest throat and then from here we're just going to gently squeeze right there to call those the walnut relax okay and one's gonna tell them hey man you need to calm down you need to calm down now from here there's a bunch of variables you can do the arm you can do it though you can and with that you can smack you can you confront whatever you wanna do but the main thing from being knocked out just don't be like this don't let say get right here like you wanna fight cuz the difference between being a fighter and a self-defense practitioner big difference okay so you don't have to get in the pool with the shark you can stay out of it make him get out and then you take advantage of it so a little bit faster looks like this boom what you're pulling back down control the person or whatever you want okay I hope that helps you and it don't matter if you in a uniform I'm glad you join us for our first video I wanna invite you the mouth to take a look at our fight scene and our film the victim art store it's on the channel go take a look right now god bless you and remember stay tough not hard god bless you", "l4a7MBfz-sw": "", "2fjMpn7JCJ0": "[Music]  wait here is not me anybody can do the knife it's that if you have a gun expert who knows what he's doing I think you can cut that 21-foot rule can cut it because he knows what he's doing now you know in in the previous videos that I've seen the guy with a gun who's got a gun it just doesn't even know what a gun is something 200 somebody comes here I mean they're not expert so what happens easy for the guy to run with a knife anybody can run with a knife but now what happens with a guy who's skilled with a gun is able to use it that's what I want to see the other thing like I talked about earlier was the situation if I am actually going to engage somebody with a gun the last thing I'm going to do is let them know that my knife is here run at unless I'm that emotionally disturbed person but again that's the next scenario is the point that people understand right and and and what what mr0 said earlier right where does it start did a seven-meter start here or did the seven meters start here you got to remember from a knife point of view I will pull my knife here knife point of view is I'll be somewhere here now the knife because he allowed me to scull you will not see me go like this well what is that that's Hollywood right so the idea of once again you can understand the parameters of even a weapons fighter weapons are made to be felt not seen because if I pull the weapon and you see it you run away or you shoot me I need to get this close if I'm not this close I'm not gonna pull my weapon out so understand that understand that in the in the context of already now we're talking about here that somebody who doesn't know weapons will charge okay then let's see what happens somebody would skill that's very important that you put that in context never important and there is a very pointed volume also about my my impact about my brain because I'm going to see someone with a big knife or my Chatterer or with a small life is the thing that ran to me and run to kill me to try to hit me and these may mean only wanting I'm under stress I'm under it stress if I my if I'm not trained for that for I mean training for that training for work and the stress but what are what we what we are going to do now first we try with a with a gun in concealer mint condition but we are going on so fast so are like a medium operator you know what I mean right I want to test this about this kind of situation okay so what are we doing here okay for example if doc start Sammy  I was exactly starting wool and we are going there where in Canada meters meters meters and in the United States they would be using feet or urk it's very different it's very different we start with a with a walk Ross hey so get on my bed but you need to understand that it's not the same because I know now that dad's starting to make this aggression in a relative condition maybe every rocks and someone can run on my back if I'm lucky and I heard a noise or someone maybe shout my attention going back I can see but I don't know where maybe I can see what is here well maybe I can see what is is there it's very different between an ambient light needs so your relative ignition it's sure that it's rocks between now you know what I mean yeah this is the worst case since now I I lost here in the radical vision is Ross between here you know what I mean okay okay whatever  see I missed that okay we'll do it again fur okay so say that again you will you're only going on his audio because in recognition is easy but now I know that doc starts running to me but I want to start my reaction really when I heard the noise and it's very easy to heard the noise here that there is known not emit noise there is no people here you know so I startling relaxed done he got you sure  so what's a tool we've done we don't need to demonstrate that is something that it's impossible we can work on these without usual O's I show you a different technique for engaged I don't this is a bad Phoenician and consider man concealer mint-condition my my shirt is not too large so I need to rip out and see the block it is not so large I want these go on after we can try also like these but now I want to work like this okay boys line but this is the first time and these diseases or these these and these or there is another technique that we are going to applicate that very fast that appeases is going to read my dad something like that going to put distance and i'm going to greet then I'm going to read because if not sure that is the only one that do that I need to control to control my side bra now but I can do another team okay  and we see that wait because oh sorry  that's enough and he sees on the bed  this is on the bed now thinking in the front there in the front it's not yes it just need a bit more ease but not too much because - oh please I am relaxed I don't know I feel a lot of fear and that started I'm going to try to find Jonny's arriving sure 100% if I have a concealer mint condition I can try to stop with my hand so I can hear the audio CDs that's hell yeah I'm going to have some of that that creates distance faster going down I can't reach what should I help mean for you that he's down now your targets here here it is easy I got momentum for my salsify shuttle reach now from a high level 12000 down I've changed I have to change my trajectory which allows in my back here that can make a distance so when if I saw someone on a front am i lucky that I have someone on my front and I love the fact I tried to go down and reduce the last chance that again I can do my friend good nothing more or I can try to make another team but is the same a'right I can try to chip off the road I try to definite myself because it's a right straight to me I waited him I thought late I belong engage this is a bad best rule is advanced by deadly distance you free I changed my plane and going here I use my knife in my leg I team for a decent and I had my hand here or here by time so I'm happy hacking in here yeah you see this the difference between this and the previous videos is that he stayed most of the time the gun with a guy the man with a gun stays in the same spot too late I will have the advantage but now he is moving as I'm coming and even if he doesn't move he moves by changing levels it's like I just like a crocodile I can only go in one direction if you change I have to change you by half a second to change and do everything and better yet when he left now I'd

debut in the UFC lightweight division he was set to fight for the title but the reigning champion Rafael dos Anjos had to pull out just days before the fight due to a foot injury in order to save the card Nate Diaz stepped in on 10 days notice to fight Conor McGregor in the days leading up to the fight the feud quickly became one of the biggest rivalries in UFC history Diaz and McGregor exchanged a ridiculous amount of insults and trash talk particularly delivered from Conor McGregor this is how the events unfolded and most importantly a great example of when trash talk goes wrong  ghazal friends are gonna be stand true to cage looking at you getting getting your carcass getting eaten alive doing it now all they're gonna do is say we're never gonna cross this river again I'm gonna talk

came and blessed you Willie this man let's see let's see can he fight you know let's he can he bring the fight he's talked a lot like he's like a little cholo gangster from the hood  coaches teach to teach you on a Sunday morning and goes on bike rides with the elderly but now as the fight comes closer he's like a scared little boy really the main thing to succeed in this game is to either be me or fight me everything else is peanuts so ask Nate that he knows that firsthand yeah I guess mission accomplished them right I could easily switch you up now and go put you back on that 20 20 and 20 if you want but all I wanted to thank you or even a little time welcome even a little dance dance for me Nate times for me and don't look me in the eye when you dance he makes gun signs with the right hand and Alamo balloons with the left hand he really should be thankful and be grateful for this opportunity that I am giving him [Applause]  make the answer making up some ground here in the second row it's  he's been overwhelmed by what's happening here I just saw scared lost little boy in there holy moly getting sniffing no one cannot live to play with him there are many many shots that mayilu the 360 round house the soft body on him he has a he has a soft flabby body like he was a fat guy I got it all figured out [Applause]  you're always making predictions on fights how's this one going to go I feel his repetitive foot patterns and his pull motions are too readable to predict ridiculous he'll be too slow in there the speed will stifle him his soft body and his lack of preparation he will not be able to handle the ferocity so end of the forest I feel he would be put away will be a old inside the fort round [Applause]  I feel myself innate we have a similar will but the skill doesn't match the will and that's that's where the difference will be I also would like to dominate him on the map I think his jiu-jitsu was overrated I think it has no positional dominance of a no positional understanding at all [Applause] you will abandon position and end up on his back on end up in a scramble so I feel if he is still conscious when he hits the deck I will crush his hips pass his guard Amell camp and then hit a pound him out RR choke [Applause] [Music]  it's about survival [Applause] [Music] Judas has defeated the notorious Conor McGregor [Applause] Conner's Galatians - you motherfucker on the show and I'm not surprised motherfuckers  Diaz and McGregor exchanged an exorbitant amount of shit-talk leading up to this fight and in this case for McGregor it definitely backfired the two ended up having a rematch at UFC 202 where Conor McGregor won by decision talks have been circulating that when Conor McGregor does make his anticipated return to the UFC it would be in a third and final fight with Nate Diaz to see who wins the trilogy it's not gonna be a good night for him hands down you know I got too much to get prepared to take somebody's life in this cage I'm

this is Fred and this is my bar and these are five Easy Bar magic tricks if you like this video please click on the link below and at the end of this video please look for all of my other bar and restaurant related videos thanks for watching okay for this first trick what you're going to need is you're going to need a dime like it heads up two pieces of paper and a high bowl or a rocks glass and first let me show you the trick and then I'm going to show you how to do it and by the way this always works good that's why this bar magic is people are usually drinking at the bar and it works so much better when someone's had a a couple drinks in them all right here we go  with the dango  right there all right let's do it again  one more time if you haven't seen it  alright let's put it back real quick alright so pretty easy trick it's not really magic at all what you've done is you've taken a highball glass and you've put a piece of paper on it like that too to make it look white and then when you put it over the dime magically Boop the dime disappears so it's all how you move your hand and how you cover it to make it look like it's vanishing so I like doing it that way I've seen other people put a towel on top of it and half the glass and then the time disappears but this is how I learned it and enjoy all right for this for this next trick you're gonna need two regular straws let's give them editor plastic oh actually I have one large and one small straw let me go fix that let me get it actually will do with this so I want straw that's slightly bigger than the other but that's no problem so let me show you the trick and then I'm going to show you how I did it I'm gonna take this draw us I'm gonna tangle it tie that one around that one that's one around that one and now you've got the two straws totally intertwined Alakazam and the two straws are not broken and yet they're apart pretty cool magic trick not really magic let's show you how to do it for this trick you got the your two straws you're going to then take the first drum and make it t put your thumb there and you're gonna wrap it around too completely so it actually looks like bent just show you so you see how that's around that and just show you the bottom just like that so then you're gonna take this next one the bottom piece you're gonna wrap it to the right all the way around and come back and grab it like that then gonna take these two and just pull them over like this what it's actually doing is its untying itself so it looks like a mangled not there and then you should twist slowly twist come right apart super magic but not it's actually a really cool trick and anybody anytime anybody tries it they really get it tangled in a knot so pretty cool trick for this next trick it's a it's a card trick and this is the easiest card trick I know it's probably the very first card trick I learned when I was like 6 so I guess I wasn't even in the restaurant of our industry yet so I'm gonna just shuffle our car and then you're going to you know have your person they pick literally randomly pick any card so they pick what's just a card deck down that's your car don't let don't show it to me that's your car so then they put it on top of the deck you're gonna take the deck you're gonna put it behind your back you're gonna show them the card and say is that your card and they're gonna say no it's not you go okay so you put it back 100 you're back you cut the deck just say is that your card and they're gonna say no it's not so then you're gonna say okay give the car you give the deck to the person you're doing to trick trick to and they're gonna shuffle it or do whatever they want you can tell them to shuffle it you know look through the deck to make sure you didn't mark the deck or mark the card you can shuffle it a million times whatever and then they'll look for the card in the deck they'll give it back to you and say yes their cards in there you can cut it again or do it every one and you're going to flip through the deck and try to find their card  and then you know once you have it set up you're gonna say you know what was your card and they're gonna say it was the seven of clubs and you go yes it was so a pretty easy trick I'm gonna show you how I do it but I'm gonna show you from my my side my view I'm actually going to show you this way cuz I can't seem to get my camera to to move from there so you're literally gonna shuffle the deck and there are randomly gonna pick any card in the deck so you hold the card they could pick whatever one they want so let's say it's that card so they're gonna look at the card which I'm gonna show you and then they're gonna here and put it on the deck so they're gonna put it on the deck when you put the deck behind your back so now this is behind your back you're just gonna take the top card and flip it so you see the card which their card is the six of diamonds but when you show them and you pull it behind your back you're gonna show them the bottom card on the deck and say is that your card and as you're looking as they're looking at this card you're looking at that card so you can see it and then you go okay so that's not your card they don't know when you put the deck behind your back you're just simply gonna flip that card and just cut the deck you actually already know what they're they're carter's then you show them and say is that their car and they're gonna say no you're gonna say here right it's not your card put the deck down let them flip through it let them shuffle let them cut you already know what their card is and then you do you know whatever you want to get the car to the top of the deck go whichever way you may may want to get the card so I personally like flipping through it and you know making a few cuts when I see their card and I get it in my hand I just cut it to the top so it's right there and when I cut it I just put it on the top of the deck now do a couple more and then when I put it down and say what was your card and they go who is the six of diamonds there's their card and literally you know what the card was before you gave him the deck okay for my next trick and by far this is my favorite trick of them all and if it works it really knocks the socks off people so for this trick you're going to need to make a pyramid of fives so you have 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 s & 5 fives and what you're going to do is ask your friend who you know when we're doing this completely concentrate it's gonna sound funny we're gonna need you to say the fives outlaw out loud the row but in the middle of everything I'm gonna stop ask you a question and you need to give me the very first answer related to the question that pops in your head and like I said if this works it works and it makes them go crazy so so what you're gonna do we can actually try this at home or you could try this at home I'm gonna point to a row and then you are going to say the row out loud and then I'm gonna start from the top and go straight down and then I'm gonna randomly pick and like I said in the middle of it I'm gonna ask you a question and you're going to answer the question so again you need to really concentrate on this for this to work so let's start at the top yeah 555 555-5555 and 55555 five thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five five five hundred and fifty five fifty five thousand 555-5555 five five hundred fifty five fifty five five thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five 555 555 thousand 555 555-5555 thousand five hundred fifty five fifty five five what's the first vegetable that comes to your so then I'm gonna hold this up and say now if that worked on you whoo and then if they say another word which is another vegetable that has that color which would be tomato it works really good it's a great trick I'm going to tell you how this works and how I said how I you know set it up you're gonna actually have the fives and you are really going to randomly pick fives so from what I have been told the number 5 is related to the color orange in your head so when you're just thinking about 5s 555 555 and the rows of 5 and then you ask them a question what's the first vegetable that comes to their mind pretty much 70% of the time they say carrot or tomato so carrot being the number one answer tomato being the number two answer so what I usually do is put carrot I have it written on a piece of paper have it in my right pocket and I have tomato written on a piece of paper in my left pocket and if they say a carrot and you pull it out it just totally blows their mind if they say tomato same thing it totally blows their mind now like I said it works 70 percent of the time but when it works it's amazing so give it a shot on your friends but remember they need complete concentration all right for this this next trick you're going to need a a pen in a piece of paper so I only need one so what you're gonna do is ask your friend and this could be a this is a very good group trick if you have more than one person two three four people it works but since I'm here by myself we're going to use a deck of cards here to randomly pick a four-digit number so we have a deck of cards and we're just gonna flip through and say okay to can't use jank I see one two four six clean seven so two four six seven is our number two four six seven now being the magician than I am I'm going to write the answer down right now before the trick is over I'm going to write down  right that's the answer hold this over  I'm gonna leave it right where everybody can see right okay so now for the second part of the trick to continue we already have the answer written down you're gonna ask another person for a four digit number so let's pick some cards  Jack we got eight ten five so we're gonna use the ten in that one I should have used those as ten so we have a eight one zero five and let's pick a few more numbers three nine eight so three nine eight four all right three nine eight four so those are all the random numbers that that we've picked or your your friends have given you I'm just again using a deck of cards to to make this work so now I am going to use my exquisite math math my exquisite magical skills to to make this work so I'm going to pick a four digit number myself I'm going to pick one eight nine four and the next number I'm going to pick is six zero one five and now let's add these up and hopefully when I add all of these these five digits up they're going to total the magical answer so let's try this so we've got 10 18 25 we got 1026 we've got 1024  we've got 1022 so the answer I came up with is 2222 462 let's see if the magical answer  see if you can see that one two two four six two so I'm gonna show you how to do this trick now actually I have a Freudian slip before it is mathematics it is a mathematic trip so let me show you how to do it now you're going to ask your your friend for a four-digit number and if it's a group you could ask someone for two digits and another two person for two digits the only rule is the four digit number they give you can't end in 1 or 0 it cannot end in 1 or 0 so I'm going to use 6 5 4 3 as a number so there's your starting number and now you're going to write the answer down to get the answer what you're going to do is you're going to subtract 2 from the final number and put that 2 in the front so the magic answer for this one would be 2 6 5 4 1 so again 2 6 5 4 1 will be the answer I'm gonna write that down on another piece of paper 2 6 5 4 1 so that is going to be the answer to this trick now you're gonna ask them for another four digit number and then you know first you're gonna wrap that up and say okay I have the magical answer if you can put it in someone's pocket you can put it on the you know on the bar under a glass so there you go and then you're going to ask for another four digit number so they can give you it at this point time you could use any numbers you want so one six seven two and another number could be five three one four so now for this next part what you're going to do is each one of these numbers individually you're going to make equal nine in your four numbers so for the first number I'm looking at as this one so my number is going to be eight the next number is six so my number is going to be three seven my number will be two and two my number will be seven so let me just show you how that looks 8/3 - seven okay so and now I'm going to make this next line the next four digits one two three four those I'm going to individually make equal nine so five is going to be 4 3 is going to be six one will be eight four will be five so let me write that down to show you so we've got four six eight five and just to show you arrows these are the numbers then I'm making equal 9 the reason I do it this way is so they can't see the way I'm making it equal 9 if you do all their numbers in a row so you're making this number equal 9 7 2 and then this number you're gonna make 5 plus 1 equals 9 4 3 plus what equals 9 6 etc etc now if we add this all up it should equal our magic number so so we've got 10 21 you've got 10 24  we've got let's see 6:12 21 22 23 24 25 this last one we have that city can 25:26 so that's the magical answer - six five four one and surprisingly - six five four

one-in-a-million moment where some crazy unexpected things happen which defy logic and totally shock everyone watching today we're going through ten sports moments that no one would believe if they weren't filmed this first clip shows a baseball game which was interrupted when an actual plane was forced to land on the pitch if one on the field runs for their lives in this dangerous situation and luckily no one was injured or killed still wouldn't be out on the mound yet  there's a plane coming down onto the field folks right now we got a crazy landing going on here it comes right onto the field right behind the field and it's on fire no way did that just happen folks and everybody running over there now to see if they can help somebody my goodness yeah be careful because we saw some flames go up you don't want that thing to blow up over there what a crazy event folks we're so used to seeing the planes here so it didn't seem like much and then it just got real close oh boy  and where's clay Johnson going through out there he's trying to get a better look over that part of the fence I can't believe what we just saw here folks that did not look well obviously having to make some sort of emergency landing and tried to put it down on the field I think Todd's saying he sees somebody that's come out of the plane and looks to be moving  [Music] this next moment is very unlucky and shows an NBA player who believe that or not accidentally scores a free pointer into his own net he throws the ball backwards trying to pass to a teammate he did it without even looking but the ball unbelievably goes into the net and counts as a free pointer against his own team actually thought AJ Jacobson was good but watch this oh it is a three-pointer and what I don't know is if there's something about if the other team does throw it in if it has to be a - I don't know but that's completely fine I've never I'm right there with you I've never seen anything like it - just not been kind oh this next moment is something that never ever happens in golf if it has this happened only a few times this is a rare moment where golf actually becomes exciting but seriously this golfer actually putts the ball towards the hole knocking his opponents ball out of the way and by doing this he actually knocked his own ball into the hole  this next football moment was absolutely unbelievable to watch the player is heading up towards the wing and it's probably planning to cross the ball in when a defender kicks the ball to try and clear it it deflects off the player and turns into the perfect shot which practically rips the back of the net  this next basketball clip shows a player who technically stopped the whole game and it's not what you're expecting this player dunks the ball so hard that the whole net and rim comes down stopping the whole game and they were forced to reschedule to match for a later date  puts it on the floor  goodness  for fuck  I'm just glad he wasn't hurt that time I mean that thing came straight down [Applause] right on the on the phones down the hands down he's done it in Phoenix he's done at the biggest media market in the look at us  there was a foul on the play to that sort of incidental now let the foul is on Dwayne so you'll get but the problem is now this is going to be another one of those 30 40 minute delays and when you have to get plane get back to Orlando  and you'll see the basket come straight down on his head here he got out a hurry oh he's lucky he is the Metrodome Stadium was home to the Vikings an American football team in 1981 something shocking happened to the stadium costing millions to repair the roof literally comes down due to the weight of snow and the stadium is flooded within seconds luckily the stadium was empty and no one was injured free Metrodome home of the Minnesota Twins from 1982 to 2008 and the Minnesota Vikings from 1982 to 2013  [Music]  last month the stadium's famous white roof was deflated for the last time while the support cables continued to secure it streets and local businesses were closed at 1 billion dollar stadium for the Vikings the home of the Minnesota Vikings or at least it used to be construction crews were filmed setting off explosives this week Benicia is immoral  [Applause]  this next moment must have been terrifying for players and fans in this stadium as this next shocking moment sees a fire which broke out in the stadium this could have put a lot of people's lives at risk and took hundreds of firefighters to take out and delayed the match indefinitely [Applause]  this next moment shows a skydiver who accidentally sky dives into a boxing match mid-round interrupting the match and injuring some spectators this is a complete accident which has never happened before and has never happened since it goes down as one of the strangest sports moments ever recorded  someone is  and somebody [Applause] as just [Applause] into the ring has been pulled away by security guards the fight has been brought to a halt there's a massive melee at ringside  as this fellow with a motorized pair has landed right on top of spectators and officials at ringside he's in the midst of a massive security guards now rock Newman Riddick bows manager was right there this is a monumental  disaster right now police are filing by me at ringside and grabbing this gentleman who has created a monstrosity of an interruption in the bail his parachute has caught itself up on a row of ring lights now we're going to take a look at an earlier shot not the parachutist earlier this evening from our live coverage [Music] as this took place we are told that our flipped camera man tried to alert us to the possibility that this was going to happen that's why he was zooming in and out as you can see here and there it is he targeted the ring and came right down  health this guy is going to wind up in the slammer in Vegas tonight and with doggone good reason  yeah this thing to get some publicity for himself this next moment is something shocking and I'm not sure exactly how this happened but due to some miscommunication somewhere this NFL match was interrupted when the band comes on to the field and swarms the pitch lead into an easy touchdown because all the players are confused [Applause]  thanks for watching guys subscribe if you know around here and I'll see you guys next time goodbye", "EChjIHaBjf8": "Arabic", "QZRLrGmoMdQ": "[Music] Mike Tyson used his intimidating aura to give himself an added advantage before and during a fight I was being either his pure brute strength and determination most guys we found pretty much intimidating they loved to fight before they even got hit after menacing pre-fight quotes and behavior if he doesn't die doesn't count Tyson would I up his opponents from the moment he entered the ring and he often sense fear by looking at their body language and facial expressions I walk around the ring but I never I never take my eyes off my opponent I keep my eyes on even the fees we're ready and pumping he can't wait to get his hands on me as well I keep my eyes on him I keep my eyes on him I keep my eyes on him then once I see a chink in his armor boom and one of his eyes may move and then I know I have them then when it comes to the center of the Ring he still looks at me with his piercing looking as if he's not afraid but he already made that mistake me when he looked down for that 1/10 of a second I know I had Tyson scored many quick and brutal knockouts throughout his whole career 22 of them coming at the very first round and having a reputation as a devastating power puncher that could end a fight in the blink of an eye further enhanced his intimidating aura [Music] I was a right to the body and an uppercut to the hand and phurba kiss down [Applause] it's over that's all  the best example of Tyson's intimidation affecting an opponent before a fight came on June 27 1988 when he faced Michael speaks on a huge unification fight for all four heavyweight championship belts now let's see who's champion and who's it's chump both men were undefeated Tyson held the WBC WBA and IBF belts while Spinks was the lineal champion on the night of the fight just minutes before Spinks was due to ring walk there was chaos around Tyson's dressing room area after butch Lewis spaces manager complained about a bump in Tyson's left glove and demanded that it be rewrapped moments ago in the dressing rooms a major controversy erupted you're looking at a tape shot of butch Lewis the manager of Michael Spinks who went wild after he discovered red Mike Tyson had his hands tapes mister and apparently had the gloves put on without a representative of Speaks camp being in Tyson's dressing room Louis's protests over the buff delayed the fight Tyson began pacing his dressing room and in a moment of anger he punched a hole through a wall and the thudding sound was heard by Spinks in his dressing room which Lewis  when as you would go into in every championship fight these dressing room of your opponent to watch their hands being wrapped I had just finished taping his hands and so Bushmills try to make a thing about it which so aggravated Mike who was already on edge that he threw his hand out through a wall Spinks had heard that and that it was the sound of Mike punching the hole through the wall which had prompted Michael to be reticent about coming in to bring the matter was eventually resolved when sphinxes trainer Eddie Futch was called in and he inspected Tyson's left glove and said that it was fine as butch Louis and everyone else involved left the dressing room area Tyson turned to his trainer Kevin Rooney and said you know I'm gonna hurt this guy legendary trainer Emmanuel Stewart was at the fight and went to check on Spinks during the delay and compared him to a deer caught in the headlights in an interview from the book one punch from the promised land Stewart said I went into his dressing room and they couldn't even get him to come out he was so scared he was a nervous wreck really freaking out 20 minutes after he was originally due to ring walk a visibly nervous Spinks left his dressing room and made his way to the race [Applause] Mike Spinks makes his way is the crowd touching him he has more of a look of concern on his face as he makes his way to the ring all to see this Michael Spinks his way into the ring in contrast Tyson marched to the ring without a robe bare chested and dripping with sweat with a deafening drone noise chosen as his entrance music  this heavy metal sound that you hear is Mike Tyson about to make his way and I believe  the sound is deafening here in the arena so I won't try to yell over it it's interesting to note that Mike Tyson selected us pre-fight music just noise every once in a while you hear the clanging of chains I think that's what he's getting mine to do to Mike speaks his head but we're waiting to see everything that Tyson does is intimidating there he is he comes out he doesn't wear it coat in he's worked up a full sweat I want to tell you the electricity of this Brown is awesome I've got goose pimples on my abs watching this event and a lot of people in here do you know all the history you've been reading about it for the past several weeks the heavyweight champion of the world comes into the ring this is whywe air sphynx continue to look nervous during the introductions while tyson bounced around and paced up and down the raid and when called into the center of the ring for the referees final instructions there was no eye contact between the pair tyson attacks banks from the opening bell and landed a solid left hook to the head and a right hand to the body by his face after being constantly pushed back Spinks tried to slow Tyson down by clinching him a couple of times I said not afraid [Applause] ready to mix it up with him a minute into the contest Tyson attack specs along the ropes and a left uppercut followed by a right hand to the body for Spinks to take a knee  I was surprised there was a body shot that put up to the canvas after Spinks took a count of eight both men move towards each other Tyson rolled with a right hand from Spinks and responded with a left-right combination that landed flush on the jaw and put Spinks down again [Applause]  sphynx was unable to beat the count and the fight was over after only 91 seconds he's not going to make it it's all over [Applause] what happened what was all the delay about before do you think Michael just didn't want this to get here this is where I think he was trying to scoot and I with my brain and make me wait it out but you know I was getting affair I wanted the girl I'm the kind of guys wanna fight let's get me a fight I'm in the dressing room with Tyson and I'm looking to rattle this guy I walk in and he's punchy standing there he and Rooney Rooney is

No", "lhULvm3TNl8": "[Music]  it was one of the most feared places on earth  a colony of the Damned  the final judgement site for tens of thousands of criminals  [Applause]  it was so harsh it broke the spirit of even the toughest convict  here was a land of no escape a hell on earth  a notorious prison colony known to the world as Devil's Island [Music] on the northern coast of South America lies the colony of French Guiana  quiet backwater this small French outpost has been nearly forgotten by the rest of the world today it's home to over 100,000 people who thanks to massive subsidies of the highest standard of living on the continent but lurking behind the colorful exteriors lies a dark past until the middle of the 20th century this country existed mainly as a giant prison most people knew it as Devil's Island from 1852 to 1947 men were sent here in Chains all were condemned to serve harsh sentences some faced the ultimate punishment [Music]  over 70,000 convicts were eventually banished to the prison colony of French Guiana city by mafia via and Kasich was really a living hell especially when you realize that out of 70,000 men three-quarters died here from disease from hunger from mistreatment and one can't deny that some men were sent to the prison camp even though they were innocent and many of them was savagely beaten tied to a bench and whip I hope that God reserves them a place in heaven Devil's Island itself was the infamous home of France's most feared political prisoners but what the world thought was just an island was actually a vast system of cruel prisons spread throughout French Guiana the largest camp was on the mainland in the prison city of saleroom this was where the convicts first arrived and where the majority of them served their sentences many tried to escape some died at sea others perished in the savage jungle most were caught in less than 5,000 actually lived to see the day of their release  the once formidable prison is today an abandoned ruin it sells deserted but some of its long gone inmates have become legendary one of them was only sherry heir he was better known by his nickname the French word for butterfly Papillon society had no intentions of helping me of bothering to find out if I was worth salvaging the world had cast me beyond the reach of hope into a hole like this well they had only one thing on their minds to kill me off no matter what [Music] only puppy on shalyah  Papillon was convicted of murdered in 1932 but he always claimed he was innocent  determined to escape he made his first attempt in an open boat sailing 1,800 miles to Venezuela [Music] but he was ultimately captured by the Venezuelan police and sent back to French Guiana the prison authorities had little patience for Pepe oh and he was condemned to two years in solitary confinement it was a sentence that almost killed him one of the most remarkable convicts ever sent to the prison colony was Rene Belle Benoit  Belvin wah had served with distinction in the French army but after World War one desperate for cash he committed a series of small burglaries he was arrested at age 22 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor in French Guiana  any other civilized nation would have given us a chance to remake our lives instead of sending us to death some of us committed the first felony in an excess of folly and we are no sense criminals now we are locked up like animals in close quarters with assassins and thieves we are men with energy and self-respect the confinement was hard with our temperament horny Belle Benoit  just weeks after he arrived Beldon Hwa attempted his first escape but he was ultimately caught in Dutch Guiana and returned to the French authorities  captured escapees often spend six months in the much-feared block house as they awaited trial before a special maritime tribunal  the blockhouse was a place of exceptional cruelty  each night the prisoners legs would be shackled to a long iron rod scratched on the walls graffiti still counts off the endless days of waiting  some of the men were walking skeletons breathing the hot tainted air makes them anemic they suffer from cholera hookworm and malaria many of them will be dead when the day of the trial arrives Honorable Benoit  but despite his confinement the daring bellman wah was soon planning his next escape how did such a diabolical place come to be ironically early in its history French Guiana held promise it's thought that Christopher Columbus noticed the coastline on one of his voyages to the New World but it wasn't until the early 17th century that the region was first claimed by French explorers soon there were rumors of a giant city in the interior made of gold called Eldorado in 1763 an official call went out to find settlers for this supposed paradise entire French villages emptied of their inhabitants as they departed for a new life across the Atlantic  but catastrophe quickly struck the ill-prepared colonists tropical diseases began to decimate the population within the first year over 12,000 settlers had died those who survived fled to three offshore islands a dubbed it the islands of salvation because the death rate dropped very very quickly they were able to find a way back to Europe and after they came back to Europe it was confirmed that this was not the land of Eldorado but this was the land of pestilence and this was a land of disease this was a colony of the Damned over the next 80 years others would try to settle this inhospitable country but all efforts failed  in 1852 Emperor Louie Napoleon the third devised a plan to settle French qiyamah and at the same time combat a severe crime problem at home his idea was to send Frances criminals to the distant South American possession regulations were established for this new prison colony including the concept of de blah de blah required a convict who had finished serving a sentence to remain in French Guiana for an equal period of time the first convicts were sent in 1852 and it wasn't long before female convicts were sent as well over the thousand women were transported to the prison camp it is shiny they were watched over by the nuns of st. Joseph's convent of Santo Rome learn to keep house learn to sew the convict who wanted to marry and receive permission from the penitentiary administration would go to look for a wife at the convent [Music] but the plan to encourage convict marriages to populate the colony was doomed from the start this'll still be fun is the main reason that women were sent to the prison colony was because they were condemned for infanticide killing their own babies it seems like a paradox because they were sent to Guiana to bear children the government schemed to populate French Guiana with the offspring of convicts was failing in both OCS vimana in Liberty they began to think that if you married female convicts to male convicts the children could only turn out to be damaged so the authorities stopped worrying about colonization they now worried only about emptying France of its context and installing them in Guiana  the authorities ended the transport of women in 1903 but by then this ill-conceived plan to rid France of criminals and used them to populate one of her colonies had turned into a folly of monumental proportions and it would take almost a half-century for it to be stopped French justice was harsh and often pitiless a convicts journey through the depths of hell began the day he was sentenced to servitude in Guiana prisoners from jails all of her friends were transferred to the town of San Martin in the northern French coast  twice a year a column of condemned Souls would march from San Martin's prison to the pier  specially trained Senegalese troops in combat uniforms and with fixed bayonets guarded the convicts as they walk through the town  since these were men with little to lose French authorities feared a mask insurrection most went peacefully others did not [Music] the column moves slowly forward  policeman hands back the curious who had gathered to watch our departure I looked up and there was my wife Nanette I never saw her again  neither prisoners guards nor public broke in on this poignant moment  everyone understood that these men were leaving the normal life behind whatever  and we've dug beyond show yeah [Music] the prisoners clamored aboard a transatlantic steamer called the margin year [Music] like cattle the men were forced into the hull of the ship  once inside the holding cells only a few hammocks were issued those without were forced to sleep on the steel floor which was often covered in human excrement  there was always a tremendous fear by the prison guards that there would be an insurrection aboard the ship anytime an insurrection was about to foment guards opened up steam hoses inside the cages and that quieted the prisoners down very very quickly for half an hour each day the prisoners were allowed out of their cages for fresh air they had been stripped of all personal possessions and wore only prison uniforms but they did have a secret way to hide valuables money and jewels were kept in small hollow tubes called plans Aleph Emet bra this is the famous plan the metal tube opened up in the middle everything valuable that the prisoner owned was inside there they could even keep small tools - saw metal bars with and in order to hide it they would use the plan like a suppository pushing it up into their lower intestine without having a place to keep one's valuables rather be confiscated by the prison guards or else it would be stolen by the other prisoners and prisoners would sometimes be murdered for the contents of their plans  after a journey of 20 torturous days across the Atlantic the convict ship arrived at the mouth of the Maroni River entrance point to the prison colony of French Guiana we steamed slowly along the bank toward Saluja we all flocked to the portholes of the cage there were exclamations of many kinds look look over there monkeys look apparent flying as I gazed out of the green jungle its immensity frightened me for I knew through it I'd have to take my chance to escape evany Beldon one  the martini air pulled into the dark as sama wrong many of the town's residents were there to get a glimpse of the new arrivals it was the only amusement in this bizarre town on the edge of the rainforest  after the material cargo had been removed from the ship the human cargo of convicts was marched toward the prison in French slang it was known as Lavanya [Music] there was a huge gate over the opening I read in large letters Count de Letran spot assume it's the banya the men behind me murmured in voice that was robbed of all hope so this is where I live until I die  the newly arrived convicts were assembled in the prison's large central courtyard the Commandant of the penitentiary made his traditional welcoming speech you have been brought to the prison colony of French Guiana he said to serve sentences for crimes committed against France behave yourselves and it would be possible to serve your term without suffering unduly first escape attempt had two years to your sentence second attempt at five more but escape is impossible there are two constantly watching Guardians at this prison the jungle and the sea [Music] a few days later our names were entered on the roll velbon wha-la four six six three five the figures burned like a brand in my mind I was the forty six thousand six hundred and thirty fifth condemned man who had arrived in Guiana since 1852  but despite the unimaginable misery and hardship to come the banya could not break Melbourne while spirit he kept dreaming of what only few men had done before him escape from Devil's Island [Music]  Renai Belvin woz second escape attempt was not successful either he and his companions were shipwrecked on the coast of Dutch Guiana hungry desperate and without any provisions they killed one of their group and grilled his body parts over an open fire  Belvin wah declined to eat the flesh  local Indians eventually turned the escaped convicts over to the Dutch police the special military tribunal sentence Bell Benoit to the punishment cell this time for half a year [Music]  bell Benoit's cell was just large enough to fit a wooden bed at its foot the so-called bar of justice  [Music] city of San LaRon where Belvin wah was kept existed solely as a prison city each morning the convicts would leave the compound and go to work in town prisoners kept the streets eerily spotless the little houses freshly painted convict labor helped make sound of raw live up to its nickname little Paris [Music] see I think I said it yeah they raised animals and farm built roads and houses all different chores then after 17 or 18 hours of work they returned to the main entrance of the prison and was searched for weapons [Music]  at night they were locked up in barracks that held up to 60 men the guards rarely ventured into this world it was a place of alcoholism rape violence and fear [Music]  the men were classified by the administration into several categories [Music] well the classification of prisoners started out with what the French called tonsfeldt a that would be the equivalent of felons they were sentenced to French Guiana for a determined period of time or for life a second classification of prisoners were called relegate relegate were petty offenders prisoners who had been sentenced for bicycle theft for stealing food such was the case with my father he was caught red-handed on the highway stealing potatoes and had to pay with the last 15 years of his life spent in the prison camp a convict sentenced to life in prison does not want to have anything to do with the relig a like my father I relegate was considered garbage he's a thief who will die a thief once a prisoner finished his sentence he was considered a liberate a freed person but in reality he was only free to live in French Guiana and struggle each day to stay alive  in the capital city of cayenne a liber8 and played for meager tips in a cafe she was in one situation if you are a citizen of Guiana that owns a small business you can have for a modest feed of the penitentiary administration convicts to work for Healy you're not gonna hire an e Beret who will cost you more who has already done his 10 or 15 years of forced labor and is worn out the last category of prisoners were the Incas or the incorrigibles these were men with unbroken wills men who rebelled against their captors but once labeled incorrigible a prisoner was destined to a faith it was very likely to kill him he would be sent to the much-feared jungle camps  men accustomed to city life in the temperate zone were put to work chopping down huge trees in the heart of the tropics half would quickly break and die  to the administration the men are things to be disposed of honeybell been one [Music] disease would eat away at the prisoners malaria typhus and yellow fever quickly drained the population  at night the men were locked in cage like cells deep in the forest here they were in constant fear of predators  venomous spiders deadly snakes poisonous centipedes and vampire bats that sucked the blood of sleeping convicts  although many tried to escape very few succeeded and a recaptured conduct might have a fate even worse than the jungle camps  the items of salvation a cluster of three islands nine miles off the coast of French Guiana this was the final home to hundreds of the most hardened prisoners Royale the biggest island housed the island prisons administration and also held over 400 convicts here life was an endless repetition  the bell that strikes at dawn to awaken the sleeping man is the one that strikes at dusk recalling us to ourselves  the sound of the bell punctuates our routines we live by it stalling another day no different from any other this is prison life forces lag Holmes  Francie's lagron who was sentenced to life imprisonment claimed to be one of the great art forgers and counterfeiters of modern times though he was known to be a compulsive liar one fact is indisputable he was a talented painter  following time spent in solitary confinement the ground began to paint religious scenes on the walls of the chapel on royale but alone in his cell he also created a series of vivid images of life in the prison colony  I think it really accurately portrays not only just the physical environment but the agony of many of the prisoners take a look at the prisoner with the double leg irons there he is in solitary confinement with a stub of a cigarette from his mouth we're think about the prisoners attached fighting with knives probably over a homosexual lover's quarrel he was telling the world the penal colony was rotten the penal colony was inhuman it was a way that the French government had decided to just get rid of people without thinking about the future or the past  [Music] across a narrow strait from Royale to st. Joseph's Island today there is nothing but ruins hoeper groaned by vegetation but half a century ago this was home to the reclusion or solitary confinement cells rebellious convicts and captured escapees were sent to this maximum-security prison  damp and moldy cells were only 9 feet by 12 the grilled ceiling allowed guards to watch the prisoners from an overhead catwalk to make their punishment even more cruel the men were sometimes forced to remain standing for 12 hours a day if you lifted up your head to look at the guard you felt like a leopard in a pit being watched by the hunter who had just caught you it took me months to get used to that offer sensation the men who planned this place must have been loved some monsters only thought beyond Shire  st. Joseph was known as the island of silence the prisoners were absolutely forbidden to talk  food served once a day in a small bucket supplied only a minimum of nourishment it was here men came to die a slow death  and yet some like the legendary Paul Drewes sank endured this cruelty for unimaginable periods but he was brought into the cells on st. Joseph's and at the end of his first 30 days of imprisonment he spat on the guards so they added another 30 days he threw his bucket on the guards at another 90 days insulted the guards added another 30 days and he spent 11 years in the solitary confinement cells and st. Joseph's half of his 11 years in the black pit dark hole cell which was completely cut off it was just a total darkness his name got as far as the newspapers of France and recite became a symbol for the rebellion of the prisoners sent to the colony  there's a small Cemetery on st. Joseph it was for the unfortunate families of the guards children who died of fever wives who died in childbirth [Music] but there was no cemetery for the prisoners when a convict died the body was rowed out to a point between Royale and st. Joseph's islands and unceremoniously dumped into the sea  almost instantly sharks long accustomed to the taste of human flesh devoured the corpse  eventually the Sharks themselves were caught and fed to the prisoners completing a gruesome and food chain  [Music]  the final island that made up this nightmare prison colony was Devil's Island it acquired its ominous name when the local Amerindians found it inaccessible because of treacherous currents that made the island ideal for isolating some of France's most feared political prisoners fewer than 50 men were ever imprisoned on Devil's Island  the island is only about 1,200 yards in circumference and one can almost circle it while smoking a cigarette it looks like a paradise all covered with palms but in reality it is an island hell where many poor souls suffer eternally in torment her neighbor Benoit  the most famous prisoner on Devil's Island was captain Alfred Dreyfus he was one of the first Jewish officers in the French army anti-semitism in the upper ranks was probably a strong factor in his arrest on charges of treason in 1894 a wave of hysteria swept across France Dreyfus was vilified in the press caricatured as a traitorous monster he was soon tried and convicted of treason based mainly on the evidence of anonymous documents  he was then publicly humiliated stripped of his rank and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island [Music]  alone on the island except for a contingent of guards Dreyfus was kept in a stone hut on the edge of the sea he thought that he might never return might never see his family again his wife's children he suffered the greatest harm that a military men could suffer he was accused of betraying his country in the first year and a half of his confinement Dreyfus was permitted to take walks around the island to receive books and letters and to occasionally speak to the guards but the prison administration became obsessed with the irrational fears in Dreyfus might somehow escape [Music] his conditions were changed radically the solitary confinement cell was built just for him outside a machine gun was mounted for added security this was an excessive type of punishment here is one prisoner alone on an island where Escape is virtually impossible and yet not only is he put in a Cell but he's guarded shackled and constantly watched the only movie ever made of the great French writer in 1897 spurred on by dreyfuses wife and family emile zola published his famous article J'Accuse in which he charged the French military with condemning and innocent men the case now commanded worldwide attention and caused an enormous uproar see diffusivity offer me but I think if Dreyfus had been locked up on an island somewhere in France people's imaginations wouldn't have worked quite the same way if you're convinced like Zola the Dreyfus was innocent that this innocent person was on Devil's Island meaning in hell it would strike your imagination very hard confined to his heart his mail heavily censored Dreyfus had no knowledge of the storm his case had created he passed his days solving complex mathematical problems [Music] but the long nights were more difficult he would write I was shackled in an unchangeable position to my been the shackles which were very tight lacerated my ankles the torture was hardly bearable during those tropical nights [Music]  on the northern tip of Devil's Island is a bench made of stone it is said that in the days before he was confined to his Hut captain Dreyfus would sit here for hours and stare out in the direction of France  I was invited to visit on the 100th anniversary of my grandfather's arrival in Devil's Island and I was very moved of course to see the places where he had spent so much time where he has suffered so much and and looking at these bars and his walls and think that my grandfather had spent so many many days looking at the same wall not knowing when he would ever return to his family so it was difficult difficult for me to fully realize what went through his mind when he was there  in 1899 a new trial was granted and after four years on Devil's Island Dreyfuss returned to France although he was again convicted by a military jury the government yielded to international pressure and pardoned him Dreyfus was reunited with his family finally in 1906 the French High Court of Justice cleared him of all charges [Music] he was reinstated into the army and in a moving ceremony captain Dreyfus received Frances highest military award the Legion of Honor thanks to his wife and millions of supporters Alfred Dreyfus had escaped the horror of Devil's Island [Music]  in French Guiana there was only one thing worse than imprisonment on the islands of salvation the guillotine  nicknamed The Merry Widow the guillotine was assembled often in San Lara killing a guard or a civilian was almost always followed by a death sentence the condemned man's fellow convicts were forced to witness the execution [Music] [Applause] [Music]  prisoner volunteers acted as executioner's and they were often the most despised men in the colony Omri claudia was hated by the prisoners when he walked a condemned man to the guillotine he mistreated him claw Co hit him with his fists swore at him called him a good for nothing but claw Co met a sad end he was murdered by some liber8 they tied him to a tree where there was a nest of ants and covered him with honey then they let him die a slow death burned by the Sun and devoured by the ants  to some men being sent to the prison commoning was a fate worse than death a few survived the ordeal only to come out broken and irredeemable  but there were those whose spirits could not be easily broken for them the only way ever to be truly free was to escape [Music] more than three-quarters of the prisoners in French Guiana would attempt escape there were only a few ways to do this all dangerous escape through the jungle almost an impossibility the convicts become prey to it and perish escape by way of Dutch Guiana must have been handed down and sent back to Saroja but there is the great and magnificent way of the sea and this is the most dangerous of all our nipple burn one [Music]  Renea bell benoit's third escape attempt in 1934 was finally a success travelling by land and sea he carried with him 13 years accumulation of journals and sketches about life in the prison colony eventually bellman wah made it to Panama and befriended the natives the Indians were shocked to find that an escaping prisoner would have all these papers on them completely useless things to carry around well if you had a sea turtle you put that in your back and you'd have enough to eat for three days but here is a man escaping from the middle of the jungle with 30 pounds of manuscript and original artwork from the penal colony he was determined to tell the world about Devil's Island [Music] Belvin woz dream seemed finally to be realized when he reached New York in 1936 two years later his manuscript entitled dry guillotine was published the French government was deeply embarrassed by bellman wah story and demanded his extradition he was forced to flee to Mexico but returned to the US with world war ii erupted in Hollywood bellman wah became a technical consultant on several movies about Devil's Island like passage to Marseilles which starred Humphrey Bogart why should we help you escape I leave that to your conscience in 1956 bellman wah was granted US citizenship by a special act of Congress his escape from Devil's Island had led him straight to the American dream  Auri sherry air claimed to have made eight escape attempts he finally succeeded in 1944 floating off Devil's Island on a raft made of coconuts  Cheri air became a citizen of Venezuela and published his book Papillon in 1968 it became an international bestseller translated into 35 languages later a hit movie appeared starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman but weather papillons accounts are true or not remains a matter of debate VVT did the truth about Papillon about his book is that it's a fine piece of work there is a part of it that really did happen to him it's been documented but he embellished the story with The Adventures of his cellmates and the convicts he met there however sherrier came by his story his prison comedy experience led him to become a very wealthy man [Music]  on November 22nd 1938 the Martin air left friends with 600 convicts it was the last convoy ever to French Guiana  World War two brought German occupation and misery to France  as the war raged in Europe US troops entered French Guiana to prevent it from becoming a Nazi be checked [Music] and though cut off from the world the prison system continued to operate  the French had known for years that the colony was a failure and after the war a plan was developed to shut down the prison  by 1947 the last of the convicts was freed most returned to France he's a leader tycoon defeated big so then they had a lot of trouble reintegrating into modern society because these men had acquired habits that were incompatible with the French Way of life many of them ended up in institutions and asylums they ended their days being taken care of by society Paul Roux sank the man who spent 11 years in a dark solitary cell could not adjust to freedom he told people that he no longer felt like himself in fact in 1949 he ended his life by throwing himself in the dubrow River his mind was still in prison [Music] 300 ex-convicts chose to stay in french guiana they had been away from france for so long that this was now their home by 1965 less than 100 of them were still alive  that year dr. Raja pretinho was assigned to the hospital in San Lauren his home movies of the ex-convicts are some of the last remaining images of these condemned Souls lit that esprit de Saskia met the spirit of the old prisoners very did slavery unikitty there were some who were jokesters and there were others who were rockin tours telling stories about their lives but others were much more discreet about themselves and didn't speak much GIM Chi Yong is great on morphine I remember one man who was always staring into space and from time to time he cried tears running down his face and you could see that this was someone who had been deeply traumatized someone who had certainly suffered a lot but didn't talk about it [Music]  French Guiana today looks upward to the heavens for its salvation this sank got  the European Space Agency launches Ariane rockets from a site across from the islands of salvation luxury cruise ships now make stopovers at Royale where there were once grotesque cells of despair there are now tourists strolling leisurely through the ruins the restaurant now caters to customers who can enjoy a picturesque view of Devil's Island  the colony of the Damned is now a country looking toward the future  if the buying I knew no longer exists it most certainly exists elsewhere the injustice and atrocities I saw are being duplicated at this very moment in prisons everywhere it is important to understand this because the prison is a prison whether it is located in Soho or in Paris and Devil's Island or anyplace else in the world [Music]", "BNOn63T56dg": "okay

exception the only difference between Tommy and his forefathers was in these clips you're looking at he's only 13 years old and while many years below the legal limit defied he was so incredibly advanced for his age he forged a fake ID just to compete and quite frankly went on to destroy men that were twice  all I do is black I go to I go to bed thinking about and I wake up thinking about it outside of his athletic ability Tommy was also a bright pupil and was left in a predicament once graduation approached he had the choice of pursuing an academic career or following in his father's footsteps as a boxer a hard decision to make for many but an easy one for Tommy I'm Tommy the Duke Morrison a heavyweight with 24 knockouts and I'm going to the top  you  during the mid-to-late 80s boxing it entered a golden age Mike Tyson was the most feared man on the planet elite contenders were starting to rise in Linux Lewis and Evander Holyfield the Rocky movies had taken the film world by storm and every one of their grandmother had a poster of Sylvester Stallone on their bedroom wall truly an incredible time for the fighting art well ring the bell all right ding-ding [Applause]  and behind every great professional is a great amateur and while Tyson was obliterating top contenders in the pro ranks a sake white kid with a mullet was doing a similar job with the head Garzon [Music] [Applause] from 1985 to 1988 Tommy had amassed a huge record of 290 wins with 21 losses in a staggering 263 knockouts and outrageous punters record and while most were against other local fighters in a Delaware area he did eventually make his way to the big league when he competed in the Seoul Olympic Trials infamously losing a narrow decision to rising star and later rival merciless Ray Mercer who ended up proving himself as the cream of the crop as he captured the gold medal just a few months later the way things are going right now it's hard telling who's gonna be the next weight champ in the world but I'd say what I will be a heavyweight champion boxing fan watch out  [Music] despite having a large fanbase before in pro career it even begun Tommy remained grounded with an attitude to gradually fight his way to the top main goal in life is to be able to take care of my parents you know if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here start with he made his debut on a small hall event in New York scoring a first-round knockout and from here on it was very clear that Tommy was a special power puncher particularly with the left hook as he was known for being able to close the distance in an instant with a fast leaping left Hayter  [Applause]  it wasn't long before ESPN came knocking at the door asking for Tommy to feature on Tuesday Night Fights a great platform for any young fire looking to build a fanbase while still taking on slightly lower journeyman at their division that's gonna make me basically a household name that's going to make people take me as a real fighter of course morrison jumped at the chance and was soon matched up with the 19 and six Jesse Shelby on August 22nd 1940  [Music] you'll be in trouble yes early loss Olympic crowds a big right hand followed up on the left by Boris didn't know [Applause] and Tommy Morrison remains unbeaten guys like I was just a step off you know the first part through the first round and second round but once I got adjusted to I think thanks uh thanks went my way I can thank us being a top-ranked for having me here okay a quick report card from bill Cayton after fifteen fights what do you see though I think Tommy is on his way still learning but he's improving from Pike to Pike soon after the bout Frank Stallone recalled his brother Sylvester was looking for a young muscular athlete to play the character tommy gun and the latest upcoming rocky after witnessing Morrison on Tuesday Night Fights he quickly informed his brother that this young power puncher from Oklahoma might just be the guy he's looking for a movie producer heard about Tommy and decided that since his granduncle was John Wayne that acting as well as fighting was in his blood less than a week later they had already begun filming [Applause] despite the movie arguably being the worst in the series Tommy received praise from many critics due to the fact he'd never acted in any sort of capacity beforehand and did a relatively good job and bringing Tommy Gunn to life okay so which will it be will you go for the acting career or will you go for the Heavyweight Championship well I'm gonna get to have a championship first and then then we'll work on the other however acting wasn't Tommy's Forte he was a boxer and now with a brand new younger fanbase he couldn't wait to get back in the ring and continue his road to the title I got a job to do and I plan on doing it quickly Tommy has a hell of a left hook he's got a great left hook period in two paragraph fight after fight knockout after knock out the now 22-year old Morrison couldn't put a foot wrong he blasted out many of the same faces Mike Tyson did a couple years prior the former world champion Pinklon Thomas couldn't make it past one round the tricky slickster James quick Tillis met the same fate a month prior Steve's house key Lorenzo Boyd and David Jacko were others Tyson faced and Tommy and steamrolled the big fight was on the tip of everyone's tongue Tommy Morrison versus Mike Tyson ruling Tommy for a shot at heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and it could be the grudge match of the century the style clash was undoubtedly going to gel well for the fans both were undefeated and both were big knockout punters and it certainly wasn't an idea Tommy was shying away from a lot of people are pretty satisfied with saying hey you know I fought the devil again for the world we don't want to fight where we want to fight for it and win it he's there when I get there with him don't have fear move just before the Morrison and Tyson fight came into fruition Buster Douglas shocked the world with a historic upset over the seemingly unbeatable Tyson  [Applause]  almost 30 years has passed since that night in Tokyo and still to this day it's regarded as the biggest upset not just in boxing but in world sports history boxing you never know what to expect and if you don't believe me you can ask Mike Tyson okay a few months later Tommy enter the most significant out of his career repeat a revenge Morrison versus Mercer - on the line the WBO heavyweight championship of the world ray Brinn three years on from their clash in the Olympic Trials Tommy had a chance to set things straight as he matched up in a widely speculated 5050 showdown with now 17a no professional Ray Mercer no Murph Mercer had shown a lot a way of promise himself during the build-up to this contest not quite the flashy power puncher like Morrison but a rough and tough resilient brawler nevertheless  and here's the big one that was the one who put him to sleep and then one more Tommy Morrison belongs in boxing Ray Mercer is the WBO heavyweight champion careful early Tommy starts very fast he has a lot to prove and he'll try to do that in a quick fashion Ray Mercer defending his title opening neither a defensive Wiz so you know there will be openness ignores about Evan gets that through every soul  rate to make him quit it has been portion in the first two rounds Morrison was in the greatest shape of his career the timing and speed of his combos during the first two rounds were breathtaking Mercer was known for having a chin of iron but to walk through the onslaught of Tommy shots the way he did elevated everyone take so many shots  puts a couple of whites together your memories Marcin with a right hand is a gift to end the third  by the end of the fourth round Tommy's mouth was wide open struggling to breathe his game plan was obviously to blast Mercer out inside three and in retrospect it was a huge oversight considering the strength he possessed [Applause]  here he is just connected with shots unanswered punches out on his feet and hurt his Tommy the Duke Morrison a lot of shots from merciless Ray Mercer the loss was a tough one to swallow and Tommy went from the hottest prospect in world boxing to a man with a grandly future after all if he couldn't betray Mercer the weakest regarded champion in the division how on earth could he compete with the likes of Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson after the Mercer fight I took about probably three months off stay completely away from the gym kind of did a little bit of soul-searching perhaps the old cliche of the great white hope would surround Tommy's name from here on out but then over the next few months a surprising revelation surface [Music] we had friends at the bars at Westport but they call it up at midnight one o'clock and say hey you better come to get you boy he's lady passed out on the floor my one coming game before the media gets here so we drag down and pick him up and throw him in the back of a pickup truck and carry him home Tommy surrounded himself with the wrong people he was already deep into a vicious cycle of heavy drinking drug taking and by all accounts of the people close to him info mania Tommy was a constant womanizer he was such a natural athlete that even after years of self abuse the lifestyle never appeared to catch up to him in the ring by the untrained eye at least however this guy didn't have supernatural powers the partying was later revealed to be far worse than first thought this wasn't just a weekend binge situation this was an every night thing I never once thought it was a bully with always when liked by everybody and I like to be liked by everybody I'm willing to get along with anybody I want skill on me despite Tommy losing that reputation as a role model that he once loved to embrace the partying went on like before only this time he was consistently fighting at a higher level in between so bouts that he would easily win as a sober man became just that [Applause]  I think I learned a lot from this do what happened 1f well the hardest punches I've ever fought I look at it as a plot you know I got I can hit all of it too much defense is something that we felt like we always had to work on something they have them in a secret so we're real happy about it well you came through it Tommy with a late round knockout congratulations to you thanks very much for talking to us [Music]  bust it up  [Applause] after defeating Carl the truth Williams in January 1993 Tommy put himself in line for a lucrative title shot against the immovable object that is big George Foreman probably didn't have the greatest training habits in the world but I've matured as an athlete feel very comfortable with where I'm at and I actually this time I feel like I belong here yeah he's probably all the things he's got going for him you know better for him and then I've got a few things going for me mostly 256 pounds I want to use those pounds suit Foreman was midway through his comeback after 10 years away from the sport he obviously wasn't considered to be the threat he was in the mid-70s still there was no denying the big man could take an almighty punch [Applause] and as his recent outing suggests deliver one edit I his daughter as well  he's got a lot of experience he's got a lot of weight and he's got a lot of age and I've got to try to counterbalance that with youth speed and athletic ability  [Music] [Applause]  despite big George being the 705 betting favorite June 7th 1996 became the glowing highlight of Morrison's career from the opening round he made the older man look ancient as he carefully maneuvered around the ring evading the slow but dangerous attacks his defensive prowess complemented his razor-sharp combination counters as he never gave form in a millisecond to recuperate from his errors by Tommy Morrison  good left hook by Tommy Mars and h1 didn't move [Music]  [Applause] [Music] work by Tommy Morrison [Applause] he's calling time again [Applause] [Music] at Tommy Morrison thought a very intelligent fight stuck with his plan and I think he deserves full credit for a victory I expect he's gonna get Jerry Roth scores about 118 to 109 for the winner and new champion Tommy  [Applause]  [Music]  once Morrison became world champion notable changes in his appearance and performance became apparent to all within just an 18-month period he appeared to age by five or six years slightly losing his boyish looks at muscular physique along the way he also no longer possessed those fast twitch muscle fibers from before the power remained but Tommy relied on a speed just as much as his strength which inevitably resulted in some shocking losses and one sided feet downs [Applause] despite the poor run of form promotional superstar Don King stepped in and offered Morris it a life-changing retirement package three fights ten million dollars with a guarantee of a Mike Tyson showdown ended all a very lucky out to put it lightly Don King accepts the contract we're ready to have the warmup Arthur stormy weathers was the first man penciled in for Tommy a low-level journeyman with little to no chance and causing an upset nothing more than a - enough to get the ball rolling for Morrison's comeback but in the days leading up to the bout an unusual headline surfaced Tommy Morrison was supposed to fight tonight in Las Vegas but the Duke was ko'd by the Nevada Athletic Commission just hours before his scheduled bout with Arthur weathers Morrison suspended worldwide for medical reasons Tommy's reasons for avoiding the blood tests just didn't make sense he claimed he was scared of needles but every boxer knows that excuse simply won't be enough to avoid such a key an important part of the sport take your freaking blood test well you told me not to do anything unless you were here you know Don wanted me to I said Tommy takes your blood test that's for the Commission Morrison had no choice but to take the test or be stripped of his license and for his love of the game and faith in God he took the test knowing full well the results could end his career and perhaps even his livelihood I've taken action to have more extensive test run I was informed just a little while ago that those tests to in fact confirm that I have tested positive for the HIV virus Morrison was subsequently suspended from the sport having the HIV virus in any sort of combat sport runs a huge risk of transmission blood and saliva often trade places during a bout and the Nevada State Athletic Commission made the right decision in instantly revoking his license but was it something that they should have done sooner perhaps seven years sooner to be more precise dating right back to the days and months in which he first turned professional and then it now said he could not pass these physical and I knew what it was we had talked about this before he talked about what the HIV [Music] he knew before he suspicioned Morrison's own mother admitted that Tommy knew to some degree he had the virus long before failing the test in 1996 and in 2016 court papers were released suggesting Tommy had been diagnosed hiv-positive all the way back in 1989 when Morrison's ex-wife Don Brady was questioned for the upcoming lawsuit in a sworn deposition she said that he had told her in 2000 that he tested positive for HIV in 1989 when he got checked out as part of a screening for a life insurance policy Morrison confirmed this himself when he went into rehab in 1999 and the counselor doing his intake wrote that he claims that he was first told he was HIV positive in 1989 we do have to add that the claims made are alleged but the amount of evidence to suggest he was hiding the virus for many years is overwhelming [Music] once Morrison contracted the virus his whole life changed the town where he was once known as a hero turned their back on him most of his close friends never even bothered to offer some sort of sympathy he was alone and scared my first reaction was what are people gonna think you know I mean Here I am a supposed to be a big tough guy and and I think I walked around in life thinking that I was bulletproof and now I gotta pay the ultimate price shortly after his public press conference Lakers legend and five-time NBA champion Magic Johnson contacted Morrison to try and help him through this hard time and offered him some valuable advice Johnson as I'm sure many of you are aware contracted the virus himself just a few years prior to this incident and it's since become a main advocate and spreading awareness of the deadly virus I would now become a spokesman for the HIV virus Morrison quickly teamed up with the former basketball star where together they toured the country sharing their stories with as many ears and eyes as they could reach [Music] [Applause] initially the recovery went great Tommy had a lead HIV specialist dr. nursing his health he took his pills regularly and began transforming his broken a weak body back to full fitness that was until he met his soon-to-be wife Trisha in the late 2000s he couldn't talk to people his wife wouldn't let anybody near him Tommy had convinced himself and others around him that he didn't just no longer have AIDS but he never had the virus in the first place the former champ gave up his prescribed medicine for marijuana and other street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine in doing so his health rapidly deteriorated and by the summer of 2010 he was barely recognizable in this picture he was just 40 years old  after a string of health complications over the next couple of years Morrison finally passed away on September 1st 2013 due to multiple organ failure and a cardiac arrest he was only 44 years old there are still so many unanswered questions surrounding Tommy's life and death like when did he contract the virus how did he contract the virus why did he give up on recovery sadly it seems unlikely that we'll ever definitively know the answers I do think it's worth pointing out that after a lot of research I was unable to find a story of a Morrison lover or ring sharer whoever contracted the virus is a direct result of himself his three ex-wives and two sons all live healthy lives to this day with Trey and Kenzie both following in their father's footsteps as professional boxers thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video a thumbs up is always appreciated and for those of you that just stumbled across this channel for the first

ability to knock somebody out if you had to in not do jiu-jitsu there's many situations where in a real-life altercation getting on the ground is not the best idea and being able to light someone up or like three dudes no way you're gonna be three dudes with jiu-jitsu you know and it happens you see on videos it's like a myth it's like a mythical thing you can't beat multiple attackers yes you fucking can like you could with their striking if there was three dudes and never start and shit you're like okay I'm knock this motherfucker out first and then hopefully one dude will start running and then I'll fucking clean up the second guy you know or whatever but to have your level of striking is important it's important you know it's important it's important if you think that someone might be hitting you like if you think someone this motherfucker looks like he's gonna swing on me like I've got a feeling like he's gonna swing on me yeah I knew there's there's that that moment when you're in a heightened sense of danger if you don't understand space like that's a real big thing one of the things about sparring that's really important is that you you know when you're safe and when you're not safe and you like a lot of people don't know they don't know when they can hit someone when someone can hit them yeah and if if someone thinks if you think someone's gonna hit you and you can't get some space between them you have to be ready and you have to understand you have to have someone have swung on you before so as you're seeing shit coming you gotta be with all his back legs going okay I see his weight dip in all the right hands coming in you know like there's a there's you have to know certain patterns otherwise you lock up that's the scariest thing you ever seen a fight is dudes like things start swinging and they just lock up because they don't know what they don't know where it's coming from they don't know what's happening that's the most dangerous it's almost more important for defense than it is for anything because half the time if you were ever in a fight with someone and they starts just swinging at you if you have good defense you just you stand there with your hands up and you wait you just wait let them swing well I'm swing keep moving you wait you wait how long you gonna be able to do this well you got 30 seconds in you yeah oh yeah you just wait you just wait and then all sudden you see a little of this you're like oh Oh oh now you're tired you don't really know how to fight you just wanted to hit me well now we're gonna fight and now you're tired someone didn't do a sprint well not just that you don't know what to do you lock up and you people think that they can do that to people people that don't know how to fight below their load yeah they just blow their wad if you you ever like if a guy like Joe shelling isn't a street fight that would be like the most terrifying thing in the world like if you don't know and you fuck up he got in some crazy street fighting after one was kick boxing fights recently no she's some other country but a guy like that first of all he could fuck you up before you can fuck him up but second of all if he decides to just take his time with you huh well you're gonna get into this place of doom this place of doom where you're exhausted and you've been trying to hurt him so he has all everything within his right to crush you and you know that and now you're tired yeah but uh well the one thing that you notice in all these fight videos and and scuffles on Instagram is that a lot of times it just seems like you got you got timed to throw a couple punches and you got to get the fuck out especially yeah when it's multiple attackers you got to figure out which dude you get a hit first there's gonna be another one and usually that third guy runs it looks like he's like oh shit he's out but if he stays down it's one-on-one now you just knock two dudes out now it's one-on-one and if you got Joe Schilling type skills boom that's where it all comes in right now but it's almost better to just have wrestling and boxing in a street fight you don't really want Jackson loose Leeds was preaching all the shit after everything he all the kung fu he grew up with he got to the States and he realized holy shit this Wing Chun isn't working on this tall white boy so he learned real quick a fight in a street the close quarters I mean maybe you'd be able to throw a kick me see through and he said in 1959 he said a dude has been wrestling and boxing for one year can beat a lifelong martial artist it's true yeah it's true in a lot of ways if guy doesn't know takedown defense and the guy doesn't know how to actually box dude I remember when I first started doing first started learning boxing and kickboxing from all my years of doing Taekwondo and I threw punches in Taekwondo but I had a crazy distorted perception of my ability with my hands like I thought I'd be able I know how to strike but is it not Astra I just knew how to do Taekwondo I was good at that and when I started kickboxing dude I was getting lit up especially when you're in a ring can't go anywhere trapped in this ring does Taekwondo have a reverse punch yeah it's got reverse punch Scott you know it's got all these it's got hand techniques but when you fight in tournaments everything is below the neck for punches so everything is below here it's it's just the body for punches and you can kick to the head and kick to the body you can't kick to the legs so all it does is make you really good at kicking that's what it really does but the the distance is all fucked up and then I realized that like once I started doing kickboxing all my distance is so fucked up because when I think I'm safe I could still get punched in the face and if they crowd me they get punch to the face and I can't kick them like my distance is all messed up and then it's also way easier to punch me than I thought it was so I had to learn and in learning it was fucking super humbling man super humbling because I went from being someone who I considered myself like an elite striker that goes on a national level for a Taekwondo I I fought in a lot of national tournaments like it I fought like a bunch of guys were really good and I hung in there with them I thought it was really good it's just regular kick boxers with beating the fuck out of me just beating my ass just kidding me in the corner jab and me you thinking off the jab right hand I'm like oh no this is terrible isn't it isn't it weird for sure Taekwondo has got the best spinning kicks and all that shit yeah it's got some really good kicks the side kick is the best kick for sure best uh you know the best version of the side kicks the techno isn't weird that the heads of the Taekwondo Association whatever the whatever it's called they they can't and they can't admit that their hands suck you know they can't admit it would think that the heads would say you know what shit maybe we should do maybe we should add Western boxing to this shit you know them do I'm sure some of them do some his beheads don't like you would think it's so traditional like they won't change it it's are still clear it's crystal clear yeah that the best hands are Western boxing hands it's crystal clear yeah the world knows this but at the top like you don't like even in the karate associations or kung-fu associations they they won't alter the style right right well you know one thing that is interesting is karate at least emphasizes the idea of punching things without gloves on because there is a difference there's a pretty big difference between punching things with gloves on without gloves on and one of the things that karate figured out a long time ago so you got to condition your knuckles condition your hands and condition your knuckles they never had that even I mean I guess maybe some people had it in Taekwondo but it was never anything in my organization where they had like a mock awara which is like a if you don't know what I'm we're talking about there's a board with rope wrapped around it's hard rope and they just fucking smack just punched that rope until their knuckles became like ballast my friend John Lee who I told you about he's the guy that I saw kicked the bag for the first time and bend it in half yeah national champion who's a monster he had one hand where he only had one knuckle his first two knuckles were just one it was one giant knot it wasn't it wasn't like my hand looks like with two distinct knuckles it was just all a boulder over there he doing all from punching bricks you just break bricks with his knuckles and he works oh that shit works oh yeah so not good to just beat on a joint until you calluses yeah this is what I heard maybe that's a maybe that's a fake broom or two but a lot of those guys that that did that they would practice on maca Juarez and on bricks and just constantly punching bricks and yeah so John had hands where he could lick legitimately punch someone very hard and not worry about it with a bare knuckle where's a lot of people mean your hand your hand is way week\u00c3\\xads think about what your hand is like move your hand like this think about all these little parts this is the worst thing you want to hit somebody with that's why this elbows are so much better those are so much better your palms even better yeah this is crazy this thing articulates and it move this is for piano it's not for Hulk smash [Music]  [Music] [Applause]  [Music]", "16J-lCSSMVA": "gentlemen were live yeah dude Stevo ladies and gentlemen Brian we've been in the house Stevo preparing himself for his long stretch in the pokey from mocking SeaWorld openly on top of a very dangerous sign dude there's a video of you you were streaming live while you you fucked with the SeaWorld sign and would you write two different ones I had the highway sign where I changed to say SeaWorld sucks and then there's the the one where I climbed up to 150 foot tall crane okay I think both of them made me shit my pants one of them we were watching it Brian and I were watching it and my toes were curling I know you're watching it live lifting up yeah we're watching knows when we're in Sea Road when you are I mean San Diego and you were doing the sign one you're climbing up the sign yeah dude yeah how did you live fall that was like appropriate it was right there down in San Diego near SeaWorld the highway sign said SeaWorld Drive and I changed it to say SeaWorld sucks I guess it was appropriate my crane one was completely fucking idiotic there is okay let me protest SeaWorld at some random construction site no we're fucking near SeaWorld you know let me fucking bring an inflatable killer whale like a toy whale climb up 150 foot crane when you're a hundred and fifty feet up in the air nobody no one's gonna be able to see your fuckin toy whale you know what's that dot right yeah Stephen a dot I know you they know been there could even tell it's right by the time I get up there I got 80 firefighters 18 cops a helicopter and a SWAT team I'm lying the problem with that stuff is if something real was going down and they had put all the resources Oh trust me I get it yes why I'm going to jail  how long you go to jail I have a 30-day sentence but I don't think my god not that I think they automatically cut it in half and then maybe even get out quicker how does that work I didn't necessarily have to go to jail at all like I asked my lawyer to get me in jail time specifically because my fucking crane snot was so idiotic I was like man I gotta go to jail that would be the only one tiny little part of it that makes any sense at all because like if you're trying to make a statement about captivity right right put yourself in kept right you know I asked for it and so you asked for jail look you couldn't now to Jim I'm sure I could I could have done like community service like you know whatever like I was like now dude because I'm a fucking attention whore so like I'm like dude like like scrubbing graffiti does not a cool story like corn of jail that's a headline you know like I'm gonna get fucking I'm gonna go to jail that's fucking that's newsworthy it's so ridiculous to the judge what not I never even had to go to court because I you know it like they oh they all worked it out so when they kept postponing my arraignment and when I went you know by the time that like the prosecutor and my lawyer finally worked out a deal then when the arraignment was back on they said hey we reached a deal and then they closed it all down in the jail before [Laughter] his criminal record ever did was the first time the first time I was like 16 or 17 like going to high school in England and there's got nailed with some weed you ever jail in another country oh I've been in jail in like five countries what's the scary five I've been to Canada England America Sweden and I'm not counting Mexico because that was more of a catch and release  what would happen in Mexico ah it was like I was you know like blacking out on Special K you know like ketamine and I was like climbing on this roof and like I kind of like fell off of it and and I don't know they just grabbed me and like detained me wasn't like yeah but it was pretty scary mirrors legit when you're in when you're in Mexico like that that's fucked you can vanish yeah yeah like a lot of people vanished right I find that el chapo guy hmm they're not gonna find a ferret no apparently they were closing in on him and he fell and broke his leg and he was carried off by his guards yeah apparently later they're closed they keep closing in on right but that's a good disappear for that guy he's psyched to disappear most people disappear in Mexico yeah people vanish in Mexico like those students like the 43 students that were murdered it's this scary shit right so when you were in Mexico when you would you sober up in jail did you like realize what had happened no like I don't know I mean I guess like it all just like kind of worked out it wasn't it wasn't big deal you know they they let me go but they just kicked Joe yeah in Sweden I was in like properly in jail for fucking five days I calm for international drug smuggling did you bring in well what I did I was videotaping it and I was in Norway and I put a bunch of weed into a condom I tied it in a knot and swallowed it choked on it I was like peeking up blood trying to get it out like God so then I flew from Norway to Sweden so that it would you know you put it on video oh yeah put it on the Internet what yeah I mean later you know later but I'm so happy so I swallowed it in Norway and got in an airplane to Sweden so that so that way I'm crossing international lines you know to qualify as an international drug smuggler then when I got to Sweden you know I had my M I was promoting my tour every interview like there they say like oh yeah how you know and listen mom man I think I might die of intestinal strangulation because I swallowed this big package of drugs and it won't come out you know cuz it took days I didn't come out for like six and a half days so this says so every like like a reporter like rode through their article or whatever it was and the cops are at the newspaper and so then they like they arrested me like after I shit it out and and they took me to the jail and and you know like they brought me into the from the jail to the hospital put me in this like cat scan machine which revealed they said a foreign object in my body I still don't know what what that was and they kept me in a cell for five days shitting into plastic bags they fucking digging through my shit and then after five days in there they brought me back to the hospital for another leg scan and it showed that like the foreign object had only moved like three centimeters like my body is so like they're like oh fuck it and they they just made me pay a fine and go you don't even know what it is I don't know I don't know they said it was like a key and I don't know sharp yeah might be still in ten years did you ever get yourself looked at again not an update that's my friend is he care that much but Sweden I was wild man and again I was super psyched because I knew I was on that little scrolling fucking thing on CNN at the bottom site for that well yeah I mean I thought I mean because we came now that when they brought me to the station initially like they put my backpack on the table and I reached into it like the first pocket they reached into the first thing they pulled out was a fucking ecstasy pill like like with the fucking like they had and it had a print like an imprint of a smiley face on it it Oh God and I didn't even remember it being in there and like fuck I didn't know that was in there and then I thought man maybe I'll be in Sweden for a while but turns out the ecstasy wasn't even like that you know they weren't even that bent out of shape over ecstasy they're more pissed about weed over there really yeah I don't know why it's just like a tree things well because we'd like they think it makes you lazy I think and they're not cool that's how it is in Asia well I think I think you know they're like you know this that makes you lazy and and and we're not fucking lazy people and so they they want a really appreciate that really frustrates me that that stereotype with weed making you lazy that that drives me crazy that is the one that drives me the most nuts you're lazy you're lazy when we does not make you fucking lazy it just doesn't I'm not lazy it drives me nuts I was never lazy man when I was loaded no my longest time in jail well you know like I got I was I was in LA County jail for five days one time I got arrested for felony obscenity and principle to second-degree battery in Louisiana whoa yeah because it was like I was doing my own show what does that mean principal - it means that I raged like an assault  like I was doing my old show and you know that part of it was I was chugging out of a tequila bottle like throughout the whole thing and I'd like you know whatever like yeah I had the tequila bottle at the edge of the stage and you know some kid like climbed on the stage and grabbed the bottle and I see these bouncers come over and just neutralize it you know I don't like damn these guys are good these fucking bouncers are pro so I said who wants to get on this stage and try to run from one side of the stage to the other past the bouncers you know it's a British Bulldog will play a British Bulldog and these guys are gonna fuck you up so there's like one kid is like this bony little skinny little 19 year old kid was like jumping up and down pointing at himself he was just so he wanted it so bad and I couldn't I had to pick him so I picked this kid and he ran he just ran I'm videoing it myself I said one two three go the kid like runs halfway across the stage and they just grab and it was totally anticlimactic and these three like football player the college football player bouncers like they just lifted him up like in unison like over their heads and legs just spiked the kid on his head on his own no and he was like twitching and and like you know I don't think they're the police report said he was bleeding out of an ear or something like and and and it was really fucked up you don't they do that when they knew that he was gonna run across me I don't know I never said slam him on his head you know I'd said that maybe fuck but but yeah and so like you know in my mind I'm thinking ah dude this is such a lawsuit like this is this is bad you know so that's you know honey you're not thinking oh my god this poor kids too but like whatever it was it was just all bad you know it was all bad in my head like the mantra the show must go on like pretend it's not bad and just continue so I'm like I was like fuck on the video and somebody in the crowd was was had a home video camera rolling on and this was like what was it 2002 so like I mean is is before they had cameras on cell phones and someone's got like a fucking like VHS home video camera and on the tape which they turned over they were like that's a crime so it turned it over to the cops or they escaped the newspaper in the newspaper gave it to the cops so on the thing I'm like that kids being loaded into an ambulance fucking who wants to play another round of British oh no did anybody sign up for round time I can't remember if we did or not but but the assault though honestly well your day as principal to second-degree battery sir whatever I think that's how I think I have it right and like there you know like that was a crime but but like the people like you know that watch this video they really were upset with with Stevo and so there was another point in the video where I state is an industrial staple gun to staple my ballsack to my leg no normal shit I'm covered in blood to like because like part of the other part of the show outbreak a light bulb over my head and like pick up like a piece of broken glass and like like literally slash my cuz the time I bleed so much and it heals really faster I just bleed all over myself and smeared blood everywhere and and so I'm covered in blood and I've got my dick and boss just blatantly out and I'm holding the industrial staple gun getting ready to staple my ballsack to my leg and I say this is not art this is just to be offensive and so like you know being that it was Louisiana in one of these parishes they deemed that felony obscenity hmm which was a saving grace man because like because the story on that one it was like Stevo got arrested for stapling his balls to his leg you know like the thing with the kid didn't really play that much damage I'll tell you right now you had brain damage I never so you get spiked on your head some cells died I mean like I got properly sued so did you go to did you lose or did you go to court was dead settled totally settled it you can see how much he got 50 grand that's it's not that good but you know did you talk to the member did you talk to bouncers you go why did you spike him on his head why didn't just grab him like he just grabbed him I know grabbed him would have been funny you know right just grab and take him out of there help you know to hold him over throw him into the audience like a stage divers yeah yeah they really really it was upsetting they should have done that see the problem is you give people a green light like that okay you've seen some shit the bouncers have done to people when people climb onto that stage there's a green light I mean right it's like it's sort of like the cop thing you know like when when cops like did you see that video recent video of the cop grabbing the school girl she's in her desk she won't get out of her desk and he just fucking ragdolls her and slams her in the desk on the ground it's when cops have the green light when they can do whatever they want to do then you're leaving it up to the discretion of this guy that's probably not thinking that straight right a little stressed out yeah I got beat up by a few balance there's one guy I grabbed me took me out back and just like pushed me against the wall just kept on slapping him in the face me wouldn't let me go he like sat there for like 10 I was like 18 and he's just like wailing on my face then you'll be like you gonna do that to get motherfucker and then just like punch me in like I was captured like  because I was outside of the club he was just ramming against the wall and shit like they're not supposed to do that right we left that club in Louisiana that night I knew I was gonna hear about it again and I sure enough like it took a couple weeks but you know I was like sleeping off a cocaine bender and my roommate says hey man you really got to get up for this and there's like the LA the LA fugitive division they had it like they they had a fugitive warrant out of Louisiana with for you yeah yeah there's a there are two charges the felony obscenity and then the second second-degree battery thing la you should just let that felony obscenity but they should be like you keep that yourself you fucking but the thing was that like they they gave me a one hundred and twenty thousand dollar bail like warrant for for the the battery and then for the felony obscenity they gave me a million so I got this I showed up on the the like the fugitive list like in like pole position number one with 1.12 million dollar bail oh my god and so their position and Ed's and so like they they brought me in they're like what you do and I'm like I stapled my balls to my leg like that nobody could understand it and I was in LA County Jail in the protective custody where I'll be starting on December 9th they're gonna put you in protective custody what yeah I mean I got I got kind of high-profile dude anything you you would be in protective custody to you and you know they I mean at the time it was 2003 I just got my back tattoo but the movie wasn't out yeah it's nobody knew about it in the cops like we're pretty psyched to have me in there and they brought me in to like they're out there office whatever like they're giving me like boxes and boxes of cookies and taking pictures of my bag tattoo I remember there they were like ah dude you'll be fine in here man what is the back tattoo through taking a picture my self portrait oh my god be fine in here man this is Robert Downey jr. block you know like we've had they're listing up all the celebrities that have been in there you got Tommy Lee like everybody they're like and and ODB's always in here you're actually in his self dude fuck yeah this has a good one the longest I was in jail was ten days in Orlando for thousands of thousands for drunk driving now that's fucked up yeah yeah like that that was fucked up and I remember like that was in 1996 and I mean I hadn't really broken out yet you know so like I couldn't really my before I mean I barely could afford to get to Orlando like I lived in South Florida like near West Palm Beach and so I could I just scrape money together for a for a Greyhound bus to get to Orlando and I was like I can't afford I can afford to get there once for my arraignment I can't afford to like go get Rand and then set a date and then come back and then come back again and my I had a public the public defender had said yeah I saw the video we're not gonna be able to do much about this you know that was the one where my arrest report said defendant declined roadside sobriety tests stating he would prefer to take a nap that I wasn't actually drunk I was just really tired and so inside told the public defender guy was like man I can't afford to like go home and come back again so they got the arraignment can we just like plead guilty and like ask that I go to jail like right away actually did the whole ten days so what is a what's worse Mexico or Orlando as far as jail well the the Mexico was just like holding you know like Orlando was like proper like proper jail like the like process and it was pretty mellow because like in Orlando they said like you know as you get like you know process you'll get prosecuted you get like orientation you know the kind of breakdown what it's going to be like they give you a tub of like like a Tupperware tub of like your belongings where you've got like whatever like your blue a blanket like a soap like you know they won't let you have a razor but like a toothbrush and they're like this year this is your belongings okay like you're gonna have it at the foot of your bed you're gonna keep it like this and like fucking don't piss us off don't do anything wrong because if you hear pack up your belongings you know then what that means is then you're gonna pack all your shit into your tub and you're going into the fucking dungeon you know and what that means like is that like it if you're in a dungeon then down there they're like and there's just not there's a you're just not on camera down there like anything can happen to you like and like you know that was like sort of the incentive to like be on your best behavior you know because I hear like everything's on camera like you can you know it was just like they're just letting you know that if you fuck up if you fuck up you're going down and bad shits gonna happen to you because you're gonna be because only people go down to the dungeon are like like dangerous people you don't want to be like fuckin with like they're gonna be with you that's the yeah basically like basically like the the worst people who are more inclined to hurt you are in the dungeon and Okemos yeah if I remember cuz I remember like being it like always on camera no matter what happened I don't there was no cameras but they're just like we're not gonna like down there and nothing can nothing's gonna be nothing nothing gets stopped think you're gonna get fired you're gonna be fucked and then it worked it kept like everything pretty like civil you know like I I was I was very well behaved now when you're in jail for ten days is it easy like in ten days can you get drugs in 10 days or do you have to like get to know the system I don't think that you're gonna have as much luck in County Jail like like County Jail by definition means that you have a sentence of less than one year and then at the point of it being one here then it's called prison and in prison I think it's like that's where you can get whatever you want and all that like really yeah I don't think Ellie I don't think like jail is is as you know probably make hooch is probably the big thing right I mean and maybe like I don't have that much experience I don't know but like I couldn't get yeah I was doing like backflips for extra food and shit like people give you food like the people that work there I gather the other inmates the people that work there you know when they had the cart that came by and and I remembered to like there was like in Orlando the jail is a big business in Orlando because it's kind of like Mecca you know like maybe even more than make it like more families I travel from all over the world to take the biggest tech tourist thing so like the business is like they say like you come to Orlando on vacation you leave on probation and then return on violation and I'd say that all the theme parks there right they have SeaWorld they're  closing SeaWorld down because you know in California they just made it illegal for them to breathe in captivity they fuckin made they banned captive breeding in the California banned captive breeding which means that it only applies to the San Diego SeaWorld but that fuckin came down whatever that decision was and it was made official like within two days of me getting my jail sentence that's amazing and I liked it they mad maybe it's such a coincidence but I like to think that I got people sort of talking about it you know like like in the you know thinking about it and then they're like you know what fuck those people well you definitely did you definitely put some attention on it but there's been some attention on it for quite a while and that were these blackfish was the big worse that was the big one that woke up a lot of people when they did just realize like whoa well what would it what is this place killed SeaWorld for me forever I used to love it going as a kid I was always telling you like you're you're going to watch prisoners you're going to watch slaves and I don't it's it's super fucked they're like water people I mean they really are like as smart as human beings well you could say that but some humans are and dolphins kill a lot of babies right now like theirs they kill baby dolphins they rape a lot they're not the best I mean there's our dicks but not with killer whales kill dolphins oh yeah yeah and whales they eat whales alive like it's a hard fucking world in the ocean the world the oceans a dog-eat-dog world or dolphin e-baby world or a whale killer whale well there has never been an instance of a killer whale you know the people that would like to come orcas that work has never attacked a human in the wild it's true well we were filming wild boys we went to Alaska and we like ran across a pod of orcas and we had Manny the crazy shark guy you know like Tarzan looking dude the ride sharks everywhere he was so jazzed he sees he's killing these fucking killer whales in the wild he's like like just dives in to go swim with them you know like and we had probably had an inflatable killer whale there too and like we towed Pontius like on it you know like try to like right through it but you can you swim towards these orcas and and they're out with you yeah but they have saved people they've saved drowning people Baba yeah you know the people who capsized boats they've actually lifted them up and helped them there they're very smart they say that they have dialects they have like I can tell they're different accents they they recognize each other they stay with the same family for a life that's why it's so fucked up when they take them away like you're stealing someone away like a child away from their mother yes so fucking dark and when you see those SeaWorld commercials they're like we haven't taken orcas from the wild in over thirty four years that's the imagine if there was a commercial for like Nabisco and the Bisco was like we haven't stolen slaves in over 34 years the slides that we have we have had them for a long time that's basically what they're saying good I grew up with a sea road in Ohio and it's really weird how you know growing up they don't teach you that like hey we captured these guys that you always kind of thought like oh they're injured and we help them and that's why they're here it was always kind of like oh I like zero because I like I want to see these dolphins do good and be better but you know watching that movie you realize you know it's the exact opposite they just kind of right now slavery yeah they say a dolphin has a cerebral cortex that's 40% larger than human beings I believe they don't mean they don't have the ability to alter their environment they can't pick things up and move them around they can't send emails but they don't have to they live in a 3d world like they can fly around in their world I mean they come up for air but in their world they can go left right up down they don't need fingers like it's not necessary so our idea like what's intelligent it's like if you can't type something of you can't build a house your fucking idiot you know that's how we look at it I just but but those things that we define as intelligent when it comes to human beings are completely unnecessary they go with the waters warm the fish are everywhere fish are stupid it's fuck they swim up to him i j\u00c3\u00a1chym dolphins probably never starve to death I mean they're faster than fish I mean I guess they die of old age but you got to think like it's less they run out of fish fish are probably easy as fuck for them to catch they just swim up and Jack them it's like food is floating around the sky imagine if you ever way you went like there's sandwiches just floating around if one of you guys hang out with your homies and grab a sandwich that's dolphin world but they do do some dark shit but they usually do it in the name of breeding that's why female dolphins are like super slutty they're super slutty because they want to have because the amount they can't recognize lines of paternity so they they don't necessarily know whether or not the baby's theirs so if they go up to a check and she's got babies and they have never had sex with her the women the female dolphins won't have sex until their baby has reached like maturity until their baby can swim away it's like a few years I believe so when the male's come up to females and they have babies and they haven't had sex with the male with the female they'll sometimes kill the babies so that she'll have sex with them again ah it's pretty fucked up Lions do shit like that Bears do shit like that too yeah that's the other thing the video with you and the lion freaked yeah okay so I'm going jail for fucking good cause man I used to get arrested for fucked up shit man you know like drugs and violence like in Canada I got arrested for violence what kind of yeah it was it was assault like um and we actually ran away from cops and got away it was on New Year's Eve when 2003 I want to say it was it was 2003 turning into 2004 did this big show and some fucking asshole got on stage and like snuck up like whatever and like sucker-punched me while I was on stage you know like fucking punch me and so of course everybody that grabs him and starts beating the shit out of them and and and I'm like and I'm like you know on the microphone saying fucking kick-ass you know like you know China like it started out as an assault on me but by the time I was like nah kicks ass and and they're beating him just all blood like and Preston lacy the big guy on jackass Heather his microphone he was like creating the news for that off mic so he's kind of blood even from that and then they like they carried him you know they cared then they were carrying him away and I like hauled off and kicked the guy you know and so like you've got in trouble for that I did yeah the cops cut were called and we just I think maybe like ran off the stage and she's dipped you know I like and got away but then I was back you know I'm you know my new tour in fuckin I was in is in Calgary and and I'm on the I'm on the the Morning News promoting my shows they said have you ever been to Calgary before I said oh yeah like I was I was here and and we really beat the crap out of this guy and then we ran from cops and got away like you in Canada well I'm Canadian I became Passport yeah I'm also American Anamosa British but what yeah my mom was born in Canada my dad was born in America I was born in England so I'm all three well you so all you do is be born in a country like that and you gotta support your citizen yeah but then they allow you to be a citizen of America too correct yeah you can't it can't be you know it can't be a resident of more than one place right but you can be a citizen yeah like I did marry like Australian chick I'm stoked in New Zealand would be even better and soon then you work Quadra right quite a citizen I'm triple national the thing was though like I'm some bragging about like yeah it would beat up this guy and fucking ran from the cops and then when I left from that trip hand over the passport like to the immigration guy like you know going through the airport he's like yeah go ahead and wait in this room and sends my flag yeah said the cops came arrested me and the guys and I mean they held me for like 12 hours or 10 hours or something and what they say when they arrested you they said you have an outstanding warrant which I think it's pretty funny it's like an outstanding warrant why'd you let you go after 12 hours because I paid bail like $10,000 bail that's it you have to go back and go to court I mean it was a misdemeanor you know whatever like I got it sorted out from you know like whatever Canada doesn't play when it comes to assault though like if you can it is the fucking toughest country to get into I mean like everybody gets have you got a drunk driving arrest or not no I'm like I saw it I don't I don't know if there was that big of a deal but but whatever you know it was great because I was able to sort of you know like clear away the wreckage of my past like for all the fucked-up shit I've done like I like to think I've made it all right you know how about the dude that got spiked on his fucking head he's fine 50 grand man Special K threw that 50 grand the first day that's a it's it's a weird thing like the Canadian thing like they live right next door to us so they're gonna be real careful about like fugitives sneaking across the border so they're super strict about any weirdness like Eddie Bravo Oh a long time ago got pulled over not even arrested for having a legal he used to work for a check-cashing company so he used to take these bags of cash around with them and he had a concealed weapons permit and so he gets pulled over by the cops and he tells the cops officer I work for a check-cashing company I have a large sum of cash and I also have a concealed weapon and here's here's my permits here my paperwork and so they take him out of the car the handcuffed him check his paperwork through everything seems in order you're free to go and they let him go so every time he goes to Canada they bring up that every time still on his record on his record still I was record it wasn't even an arrest he pulled they pulled him over they checked me but when it involves a gun if it involves anything where you large amounts of cash everybody kept tight about but it was it was all legit it was he worked for a check-cashing company so he had a total 100% ironclad excuse they let him out I mean it never brought him to jail they let him go yeah but still every time he goes to Canada they check him is hasn't James had a real hard time because Kevin James got in a street fight like in like high school or college or something like that and got arrested no conviction not nothing but every time he would go to Canada when before you're famous we do the Montreal Comedy Festival together every time we'd go to Canada they'd fuck with him you know Australia is the same way man Australia is like maybe even harder to get into than Canada and like Matt and I'm not Australian so when I when I go to Australia I have to like feel like a with my visa application I have to submit my entire criminal record like my whole history and it's like so long it's hilarious like you know there's even a bunch of stuff I didn't even mention like you know like

like you know after after that then that's like okay now I'm gonna really get into it and so it's sort of like I start off you know addressing like how people have asked me for so long like how did I get into it how to jackass shit start mm-hm and you know I give like a super condensed like super hilarious like sort of fucking Genesis story of like you know starting with like me in high school and getting caught and dealing drugs and like and you know like going into college and just fucking up royally I mean I ever fucked up royally at in college and not to do in college it was so bad well within two weeks of class starting my freshman year I was I was on final disciplinary probation which is fucking impressed two weeks yeah I got my room rate and like they found on alcohol and weed and shit and said like you know so they they relocated me into another fucking dorm you know and they're like you were on final disciplinary probation and like I climbed up like that broke out a window and climbed onto the roof and you know clay there's a radio tower on top of the roof and I climbed up that and someone spotted me from the ground and and so the cops came on the roof and they kicked me out of the dorms and I was failing the fuck out of my classes and and then I just got in a van with this dude and just took off without him withdrawing so I got I got in a van with I failed out I got kicked out and I dropped out oh my coach I call overachieving mouthful I know and things like you know people were like when I was leaving the University of Miami it's like well what are you gonna do now and I'm like I'm gonna fucking videotape fucked up shit and I'm gonna I'm gonna be one year was this 93 so you had this idea in 93 oh yeah I was in and even then I was like man like I had like special fucking skills you know like I had like I was really fucking good at drinking bong water  and Kara murky it was much very much said I don't even care how murky it was if you live a whole life that never comes out of your mouth you live a good life right and like I was like I you know it was Miami so I was like super they're like blow up class and I'd be like practicing jumping on the diving boards at the at the pool and I'm like I'm never gonna be a diver but if I jump strictly off of like roofs of like apartment buildings and shit into shallow pools then it's badass so I was like I got pretty good at that oh my god like my specialty was like setting myself on fire with like hairspray and rubbing alcohol and so at the point where I'm not even like fucking five minutes into the show at this point and I had to say my specialty was setting myself on fire with hairspray and rubbing alcohol so I'm getting at that point demonstrate like it's camera do you like that at a in the theater they let you do it in comedy clubs all the time I kept getting so hurt like I just like because what I do is like I'm going to do like kind of deluxe version for this one like I'm gonna start with like a can of hairspray I'm gonna like spray my like all the hair on my head like heavily with the hairspray I'm going to climb on top of a table on the stage and douse my arm with rubbing alcohol fill my mouth with lamp oil then I'm gonna click I'm gonna click a lighter and light my arm on fire like just the rubbing I'll call my skin's and the trails all the way up to your hair well like a drop like from when I pour it like on the table there'll be a puddle and so like a drop will stand fire probably and then so the table will be on fire my arms on fire and then like so I'm gonna use my arms and torch when I do a front-flip standing on top of the table and simultaneously as I do the front flip blow a fireball like off of my arm like which is a huge lamp lamp oil goes crazy so like the lamp oil and as I'm flipping for like the front flip my head like everything just goes right through the fire so when I crash on the table on my back now my head's on fire and so then I get and get up and like kind of like like flail around the stage with my head on fire and my buddy comes around and out with a mouthful of lamp oil and he comes right out to me and he uses my head as a torch and just you know blows a fucking huge fireball off of my head and and then like we'll figure out how to put me out you know then we'll figure it out right right I mean maybe he'll have like a towel or something because I've gotten like a towel my bare hands think about it well I mean it didn't occur to me that they would freeze had that I was gonna do it until I already did it a million-plus people are gonna hear this someone's gonna tell them all right well then fucking I better figure it out I've done it in the fucking thousand places have you ever let anybody know beforehand on a podcast did I feel like a fucking flashback from Calgary coming back it's like all the times you hit yourself in the head with sodas you've knocked out a  segment of your brain that's just the worries I got maybe with you would definitely have a bunch of people Authority let the fucking fire marshal know or whatever do it like this is so important man I have to do it aren't you scared that like maybe you'll get really injured and you can't finish I mean like  really bad and it hurts but it's not gonna like stop me you know Wow like half the rest of your show could be you looking you know like a steam coming on face movie  it's like it's part of the fun right being all fucked up yeah I mean I think it's whatever I mean the crazier the better you know like I'm in this to fucking really make an impression whatever like it's gonna it's gonna go on and there's just gonna be like so that's kind of a one-man show but the thing is like it's also like fully stand-up man I've been on tour doing stand-up for five years now yeah I remember when you first started doing I was like that's it because you first started doing it like right around the time we were getting sober right I had been sober for like two years when I really don't into it and that I wasn't sober yet when I first started oh you weren't yeah first time I tried it was 2006 oh okay so you took a break and then came back yeah I mean I just dabbled in it until I've been sober for a couple years but that's pretty much what you do now pretty much yeah now is being sober does that fuck with your ability to do a lot of these crazy stunts well obviously not you know I would say that I I mean if you're like sober like you know like deliberately hurting yourself isn't necessarily easier but it's like I never did that because you know wasted I did it because I'm an attention whore and sober not take away the drugs and alcohol I'm still an attention whore but you embrace that fuck yeah do you why do you think I haven't fuckin tattooed myself on my back you know like everybody's favorite topic of conversation is themselves I'm just like I think that's hilarious and I'm cool admitting it but it just seems like if you were fucked up on drugs and you made this career of like getting hammered and and going out and doing wild crazy stunts that got you injured and then you cut out the getting fucked up part right but you're still injuring yourself well I mean injuring myself isn't like isn't as much of it you know I mean sure I still do it I don't carry what's the most injured you've ever gotten I threw myself off of a balcony at the University of Miami after I dropped out and then I came back and just lived there even though I wasn't allowed to there's like a keg party and I was trying to like impress this fat chick and that was on the balcony like but I had taken too many pills and drank too much booze and I'm telling this girl this was in I think it was Janie I was January of 1995 and I'm telling this girl said I'm gonna be like a fucking super rad stuntman and we're on the second floor balcony I tell her like you know like okay like I'm gonna be like this fucking gnarly stuntman like picture this I command like like there's a fight on the balcony you're right and like I get punched and I'm like pretending I get punched and I just throw myself off the balcony now I used to throw myself off the balconies all the time but not when I was that fucked up and not when I was trying to pretend that I had been punched and so my whole my whole game plan were like the way I would do it I did did it different I didn't catch the bottom with my hand and then let myself go I just spun over the railing and so I spun over the railing I landed on my fucking face on the bottom huh and I broke I burn I have the cat-scans they're so gnarly like I broke my my cheekbone I broke seven teeth I had ten stitches in my chin a concussion and a broken wrist and that's actually pretty good considering you fell onto what concrete and I was landing that landed there and I was fucking face down from where I'm from where I needed the ten stitches I had like a pool of blood like growing I was facedown and I'm not even fucking twitching a finger at all I'm just like there's just blood pooling you know and and I'm not moving and everyone's like thinks I'm probably dead but my buddies were like they're like man if he's not dead he's gonna need that weed in his pocket I had like kind weed you know they like fucking proper good weed in one pocket and like swag weed in the other and and they you know pulled it off put it out and and and in the morning I knew my mom was like I didn't even remember landing I gotta remember anything you know and they called the ambulance whatever that came and and then in the morning like I woke up and I was so fucked up it was I knew my mom was on a cruise ship in like the Caribbean but I but I told him I said oh I needed to call my mom and they said of course but what I did was I called my buddies down at the University of Miami I said hey I'm gonna fucking leave out the fucking emergency room entrance right now come scoop me up and I broke out to the hospital in my in my gown okay and they came and picked me up and I went back to the spot and I stood like right over like the pool of blood and I tried to pound a beer but I couldn't because it hurts too bad and I couldn't eat or anything and I was like like my sinuses would like fill with blood and then I would like Hocking you know like you hock a loogie and I mom and then spit it out and it was just blood loogies for like two weeks I tried to eat applesauce and I couldn't even fuckin eat applesauce because I was so busted up and so the applesauce a bowl of applesauce sat next to my bed just with blood loogies in it I had broke my wrist too so I had um the cast on my wrist for like whatever you have it on for six weeks and my mom like sort of felt bad for me because my I broke seven teeth and so my fucking all my front teeth are all busted out and she knew I was a fuckup you know which teeth like it was it was like my front one of my front ones and then there was one that didn't break one on the other side of that one did break so it looked extra bad right and my mom like felt bad for me she like sort of had like you know felt bad for me you know she's sort of an enabler it's here so she said a dentist appointment for me to get my teeth fixed you know like and she's gonna pay for it and I still got the cast of my wrist and and the night before the fucking dentist appointment or I'm gonna get my teeth fixed is when I get fucking arrested for my first drunk driving you know and like and so they fucking take me into miami-dade fucking county jail and I'm in the holding cell there and and one of the fucking like correctional officers in the jail except my fucking car and says that caste is a potential weapon you know like like like if I get into a fight in the holding cell now I'm gonna have an unfair advantage because I've got this cast on my arm so they're like you can't be in this fucking holding cell you have to go in to this gnarly fucking like crazy fuckin you know insult with like all the people are in here for the longest stretch of time oh god you know and this is the first thing I had to do was go and take a forget naked and take a fucking shower in the back of this big cell with all these bunk beds and all these fucking creepy assholes and like this sucks man I called my mom and I was like mom you know like you know I'm in jail you know and she's like she's like what you know like she says I'm not bailing you out unless you go door-to-door straight to rehab and I'm like okay so I went to rehab like in 1995 and and I remember these fucking guys like that when the counselor says like yeah you know like 95% of all alcoholics like died drunk of causes related directly to alcohol is I mean I like most people like they don't get sober you know like and I'm sitting there thinking man this guy's telling me like if I had like really wanted to get sober I got a 5% chance I'm like fuck that so I stayed loaded like I just resigned myself to being loaded forever and it wasn't until like 13 years later I've silly gosh so him saying that so it's me fucking wasted but what it did really wasn't what it did was it just made me not like get sober until I was really ready you know I think it's what made you really ready well I mean fuck I got in like Knoxville called an intervention I mean like that's when you know your fucked-up interventionist uh what was going on that he had a step in well I had this like fucking massive mass email thing and I was like broadcasting my downward spiral in like fucking real-time like you know 200 the most like you know influential fucking people in the entertainment industry whose who had the misfortune of giving me their info you know and it was just like more fucked up and it's kept getting worse and worse and and and I got arrested for like you know felony cocaine possession there was another one of my fucking arrests let's felony cocaine possession you have a well there's no such thing as misdemeanor cocaine possession that's even like a little bit yeah but I got a victory I got you know arrested you know like this is when I had like my neighbor in this apartment building I lived in was always calling the cops because I deserved it like he was a lawyer and I'm like an asshole and I'm always making all this noise so the cops are always coming but typically they would get to my apartment and they bestowed they'd be like oh no way Steve oh cool man have a good night and sound like David so they would take off you know there's this guy fucking his life was misery because wasn't like because I was such a fucking you know loaded asshole I'm thought my fuckin drugs and fucking being wasted I was just became particularly mad at him for always calling the cops on me so I like I'd like fucking take like a baseball man like powdered or whatever like fuck you call the cops you know like no and and I was like I was in pound I was like you know I was like pounding on the wall that separated our apartments like all the time it's like how you like that fucker you know how do you like that and I pounded on the walls so hard that I fucking actually pounded a hole through the wall where I'm looking into his apartment Haitao see his apartment aside I punched  well the thing was that I pounded enough and then I took a broomstick and fucking just pounding pounding baton til I got through you know so now he calls the cops and they actually have to arrest me for four whatever fucking vandalism you know like it was a misdemeanor but I've been I've now vandalized his property by pounding through the wall so they come to arrest me and this time it doesn't matter if they're stoked or whatever like you know and I'm so blown out on fucking ketamine and I don't know what's going on and I got fucking bag of cocaine in my pocket and like and I'm and I open up the door like I got I'm shirtless I have no shoes on and a bag of cocaine in my pocket and I'm out of my mind and they're like hey we're taking it to jail because we have to arrest you for vandalism and like it's gonna be cold and so I'd like as a courtesy like you can go in there and put on a shirt and put on some shoes I thought my fucking shirt fuck surgeries I mean well that would have been like the perfect opportunity for me to go in take the bag of cocaine out of my pocket and I put on lead out like it was a perfect opportunity but I'm like fuck that yeah so they take me to jail with no shirt no shoes and a fucking and I get reared they've go to your property you know that when they process you under jail and so they pull out the bag of cocaine and they really they really at the jail oh my god so I'm in there for like three days or something and it's on the news and apartment buildings fucking over me even though I've rented four apartments in the building because one was a skate park one was like sort of like my my buddies then when my one guy edited my videos and stuff this kind of an office had this like assistant chick oh this is such a fucking joke I mean her job was just to tell people that she couldn't find me and I constantly changed my flights because I always miss my flights you know she was like a travel agent at best but I had an apartment for her and then I had my bachelor pad so it was four and still the fucking apartments like get the fuck out were you ready for apartments and then you still get evicted like that's when you know you fucked up well especially when one of them's escaped part right I know but it was it was like it was like neck then the next to it on one side was a fucking like Russian hooker operation oh so they were complaining you know they're dudes coming in to fuck these hookers all day long where did you live I've specific right across the street from rock'n'roll arouse oh right in the midst yeah I mean right on the part of Sunset place to live and the lawyers live in there closer I don't know that I ever actually met him like man I mean yelling like through the door like whatever maybe like a summer I wouldn't recognize did you feel like you want to go back and apologize to him I tried I tried I actually had his email and you know I reached out to him and I said hey like yeah it would mean a lot to me it's like we could meet up and you know and he just declined so I had to respect that you know but yeah that's kind in an email he declined he declined to me yes so I just sort of like when you're in that situation you want to go through and make things right right you have to respect that you can't like be persistent in them so to make it right to that guy like you know it's called a living amends where I sort of I'm not gonna do that to anybody else and it's a party thing about rehab it's just like  basically a thing about life you know but um that's something that they asked you to do like when you're you own to rehab their rights it would be considered step 9 of the 12 steps you know we made direct amends wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others so yeah so that's part of the deal and now I can finally get out of jail and I come back and there's a fucking eviction notice on my on my door you know like get the fuck out within three days oh actually that there was that yeah I got an end like I had all drugs in my apartment so like I get back and like there's the eviction notice but like I just go straight for like the vials of ketamine I had like two or three more vials Academy hooked him up in the microwave you know I find I went digging through cook them up no Mike how do you how do you handle ketamine well yeah I mean it's best I never just like injected shit I just never got that far but you just cook it in the microwave and it evaporates like the maybe water I don't know and you're left with like the the plate it's like crusted to the plate and then you scrape it up with like a card and then what you do with that started snort it ya know how did you how did you get started on ketamine cuz ketamine is like a like that is my favorite man first time I tried it I don't think so Neal Brennan he's the co-creator of the Chappelle show stand-up comic funny guy he's been taking ketamine treatments for depression it's one of them yeah yeah yeah it's one of the more recent treatments for depression why they've been well because it resets the way you any intense psychedelic experience and ketamine even though it's a tranquilizer is thought of as a pretty and really that's how you look at it but did you have like outta body experiences or any experiences where you felt like you went into another dimension and trip you know the K hold experience some of the experiences I had with ketamine like person I got weed depth perception like wave fucking looks like some fear and loathing shit you know like you're not like you know about it like I've been I remember like like my fucking feet are like 30 feet away in a hotel room in London there's no with just way too much of the shit and like and at one point the whole hotel room just started free-falling I mean my god well nothing is like looking up like I could actually see like a like kind of an elevator shaft type deal that it was falling through you know like it was just the hotel room started free-falling and I'm like just thinking whoa and I remember being so stoked I was thinking I'm ever thinking Jim Morrison doesn't have shit on me like I'm so good at being a drug addict like but um so yeah I've been cooking up the ketamine and whatever and I packed is it coming but it's becoming a liquid form because Michelle so that initially where you would stick need a limit on shooting to a cat usually I think horse as much yeah horse uh-huh I mean PCP started out as an anesthetic that was the idea for it but yeah within like two hours of being of walking out of jail I have my buddy videotaping me I'm jumping up and down on the roof of a parked car screaming god is the Sun and like this squad of like security guards that comes over and like you know what's going on you know like I mean it's amazing that I didn't go right back into jail for another Hey pockets full of drugs you know and so there but I mean and I did that bender lasted for I don't know like maybe 24 hours and now I've got you know my three days is like and I've got one more day I got to be out of the apartment so I send the mass email list I'm going to say hey you know Megan with all the jackass guys on it but of course 200 like high-power people in Hollywood need to know this that like hey knocks on guys you know I I got to be out of my apartment tomorrow and I'm not fucking leaving my apartment I don't want to fuckin leave here until I jump out of my bedroom window you know it should be like a 25-foot drop onto the sidewalk and I need you guys to bring something for me to land on preferably a hot tub I already like to put a hot tub like and cannonball into and out of my bedroom window and and in my sliding glass door in the living room I could pull it open and I wanted to put it like a ramp in the living room and ride a motorcycle lay off the ramp through the sliding glass door and jump onto the roof did you imagine if you own an apartment that's not some explaining me bad weather the sliding glass door then because he's like just like a 3-foot gap to the fielding next door like that part was a gimme yeah but so I said like knocks I see you guys come over bring a fucking camera this is we're gonna fucking start filming like jackass three and like you know get over here c'mon man before I leave we're gonna do my eviction party stunts and and so basically I scheduled my own intervention knocks out reached out to dr. Drew who was on the list the email list he's like hazy he was like about to die and dr. Drew said yeah you're right you know he said get over there and fucking if you got a timeout put him in the trunk like take him to the hospital oh and that the other part I said if you don't bring anything for me to land on I'm fucking jumping anyway I promise I'm ready to die so they printed that up it was like I mean threatening my own life which qualified me for the 5150 law where you can lock someone into a psychiatric ward Wow so they came over to for my intervention and and like they're like it wasn't like the kind of intervention where like where they ask if you're willing to accept help you know it's like like we're taking you to the psych ward this is what's gonna happen if you don't like it we're gonna kick your ass and take you anyway so they take me to the psych ward for the the 72-hour hold which is like you know everybody's been on that  like you know the whole deal but the thing was when we got there I was like spitting on people I was just like not fucking cool and like I was trying to throw shit around and you know like I was like when I remember because what I thought I was gonna like calmly explain that it was misunderstanding and be out of there but like what happened was they had the emails printed out where I'm like saying I'm ready to die you know and so like they had me I wasn't talking my way out of it once I realized I wasn't getting out of it then I'm like fuck you know I grab go to take a chair and throw it and like I get fucking tackled by like these orderly dudes you know and they slam me on to this fuckin I stretch her like bed thing with straps on it and like someone jabs a needle in my butt cheek and then I just straight took them back like that Thorazine shit man like is gnarly man I just held you down and whacked you with that yeah they just held me down and fucking jam to my butt cheek and I was out dude and then I woke up from my nap and and I'm in it was so funny though it was at cedars-sinai Italians you know like what's that mean aliens just the mental health didn't like division or whatever so like they have they've got they had two wings of the of the psych ward they're like one like they've got the standard-issue harmful to yourself or others you know like committed for the involuntary psychiatric hold then they've got the something outs like the extraordinarily you know like the extraordinarily qualifying individuals you know and that's you there's something out swing yeah so it said they had me on to something else wing and like whoa yeah and like my roommate was like fucking like like like hiding in the closet from like fucking demons oh dude it was I mean I've been hearing voices for like a couple years you know  oh dude oh you're the best I have angels and demons you know like someone would tell me like you're worthless you need to die and I would be like trying to suffocate myself to death you know really well yeah I mean not like with anything I'm just holding my breath right but that was the whole thing was I was hearing voices because I was huffing so much nitrous oxide and while while you're doing ketamine while I was doing cocaine I never smoke this joint just fucking relax you make me feel so much better about myself I used to watch you watch intervention so that I could feel better yeah and I'm worried about your health more than I'm worried about like you overdosing I'm worried you're over it's it's a slow deterioration of your fiber yeah like the stuff that keeps you together you talking to me I'm fine now I am right now I feel like I just worked out something else worried like people are like the not people one guy I remember one guy like shit on the fucking ground and was like breakdancing in it like trying to like dude he was in school with shit like spirit around this is in the room with you no no that was in the hallway it's break yeah I mean it looked like his breakdancing but he was like he took a shit means trying to smear it around as much as he could it just looked like dancing because  because I was so I was so belligerent think they changed my status from fifty one fifty to fifty to fifty which meant they like like 5150 is three days 50 to 52 weeks so they had me for two weeks and like after like four days then they made me over to the regular psych ward and like I was in there and this guy who is like a fucking he says his heroin addicts and he's a patient and like he's got this book about alcoholism and it's like dude that you have you really like this book can really help you like you need this book and I'm like why is it fucking heroin addicts giving me a book about alcoholism when we're both like on suicide watch and a psych ward yeah like what's the deal and I was like at the point I was like I'm like dude I can't I can't get sober I couldn't you know I was I honestly felt like like nine of thought like I mean like just core belief you know that like if I could have ever gotten sober like I was past that point I was too far down the line I was a write-off a lost cause and like so I just you know like from when the fucking first time I was in rehab you know like there's no chance and so like one night I couldn't sleep and I like just open this fucking stupid book like not to find a solution but straight up to kill time you know that's all I'm trying to do I'm reading it it's talking about like you know like hopeless alcoholics determined to die and this and that and then like they they become like you know they get better or whatever you know they become like the finest men you could me and I'm like just remember reading and thinking like dude what it's saying is like the more hopeless the more fucked up you are the better the chances for recovery which is actually really fully well why is that because if you have like any inkling like that like you can manage it that you could get better that you could stop on your own then you're just straight-up not a candidate yeah that's the rock bottom fearing pretty much and it's it's it's true like if you feel like you got it or it's not that big because I write write write he's for me like step one we admitted we were powerless over alcohol you know her drugs or whatever the case may be like like would like and and that like that I've successfully did you know like I can't do it I'm fucking powerless and so that's like the first step that's like the prerequisite and so it's like I don't know and then these guys come in and talk about alcoholism and I wouldn't have fucked never listen to a word they said but they like you know but I was locked up in a psych ward and so I did and I'm like you know thinking there's nothing I could do about it but they told their stories and how they lived and I'm like oh these guys can do it you know and and so I was just like my life is a fucking mess I was in the sacred long enough to be like okay my life's a fucking mess it's time and I went to rehab and so you've been clean from 11 and a half years just from that moment on from the Wow and as been any moments were you tempted to go off the wagon I mean sure but like not like I went from there like door to door into like a rehab you know and I remember like because I knew from the fucking back in the day like the whole 95 out of alcoholics don't get sober like the guy who was in charge of the rehab and back then it was dr. drew I could he was he was the the chemical dependency director of this hospital in Pasadena and and I was a nice place to go Pasadena yeah and I told you I said I said hey man you know I'm like right out fresh out of the psych ward like you know and I was such a fucking character I was like an atom like dude I know that like I know that you know the odds are not in my fucking favor I know like I don't want to waste my time I'm gonna do this I want to get right so I told you however long you recommend that I stay here I want to stay significantly longer because I want to give myself like you know I want to get myself an advantage he said that's great you know but like don't stay here more than 30 days if you're really serious go into like a sober living you know like a halfway house kind of a deal and and so I did man I did everything that was fucking people don't mean I did like all the fucking recovery shit that they talked about I did it all and I wind that fucking sober living and I stayed there and so I had two two full years of sobriety I was filming where you stayed in sober living for three years while I was bouncing around treatment like for six months you know because I was having a tough time with it I just stayed in fuckin treatment when you say bouncing around treatment well I I did 30 days there then I went into like a sober living that doubled it was like it was like sort of mid-level care so like I was free to go at night as long as I'm home by curfew but all day long right we had all of our little groups and like like you know structured rehab activities how much is all the shit cost my god expensive it was stupid like the 30 days is I gotta grand oh my god what the fuck and I didn't even necessarily know that so you pay for all this I paid for with my own money oh my god so you're just burning through your savings while you're in there God so six months it's better than the fuckers $300,000 I spent on fucking suing like my these fucking people I knew I was gonna get nothing out of he spent 300 grand suing people that you knew you were gonna get nothing out my back cat like these guys that I had a distribution deal with my God my back catalogue of DVDs but whatever that's not worth anything it was just a straight resentment fuck oh I see I just wanted to fuck their lives yeah I know that I did it  rehab is a better investment yeah so so while you're in there are you working hell no I no fucking burned all my bridges man you know like I'm doing anything with jackass and like anything else I had going on like I had a TV show that which was really like did well in the ratings but I was such a fucking nightmare that they cancelled it just on the grounds that they did not want to fuck with me I had the spot right after Monday Night Raw the wrestling on the USA Network Wow I came on immediately after and I kept like a fucking whopping percentage of their viewers she was name is show doctor steve-o I went around in a fucking modified ambulance with a hot chick and a fucking 365 pound black like football player driver dude just trying to deal with safai America one was he at a time how are you trying to get them to do I would accept like its submissions where people would be like dr. Steve oh I need your help like I you know I'm a wussy like this is my unique case and I would prescribe for them some kind of like outrageous like jackass bullshit to make them come out of their shell or like it was good man like I did a great job problem was as soon as the camera stopped rolling I fell off from the radar except for my like it was buna memory their production company like my army that started like openly attacking like John Murray why on my for 200 people because he wasn't like pay somebody's one of my buddies something I wanted them to get paid for which they did more than obligated to fucking pay in the first place but I'm trying to ruin his reputation with like all these you know on my fucking crazy email list and that was what kill that was what killed the show despite the fact that it was like number one is fucking timeslot oh my god so I didn't have that fuckin to get to distract me from my recovery so you are doing you're just doing I don't think recovery not so how do you spend your days like when you're doing that well I mean when you're in rehab rehab like you got like fucking structure shit all day long like what cuz I mean what do you do I mean like different kind of groups like they take out various kinds of meetings you know like you got like fucking like a little therapy bits like you know whatever it's basically like summer camp it's just everything is geared towards teaching how to stay sober all day long yeah well how much can they teach you about staying so I'm confused  yeah but it means go on for two years oh no no the first 30 days it's like teaching you like coping mechanisms keep you occupied and drilling into your head that you can do this and right and like 38 slow process but like it was great for me to stay and sort of in that environment for two years because because then I'm like undisciplined motherfucker you know by the end of it I was so like used to like being up by 9:00 a.m. with my bed made like pissing into fucking plastic cups like at random you know twice a week like scrubbing the toilet when it's my turn to scrub the toilet you know like keeping everything you know and and and I did that when I'm filming jackass 3d I'm like oh yeah like I gotta go fucking get launched into the fucking sky and a porta potty full of dog shit I might be a little bit late for curfew tonight you know like or whatever you know like was curfew what time I'm the one the weekdays it was 10:00 and then on the weekends it was 11:00 or 12:00 what or maybe not I think it was 11:00 on the weekdays and 12:00 on the weekend I think it's hilarious that after a certain time of night like they think you're just gonna get whacked well I mean what happened stay up we can't go to a diner you know what do you it saved my life man if I can save my life big time and I'm so fuckin stoned about it so just the the schedule the rigid schedule the routine the structure the structure did you enjoy it in there did you have fun you meet nice people I mean I remember it pretty well my roommate it was cool and like he snored which was like the fucking greatest thing ever because I knew when it was cool to jackoff you know like the sweet sounds of snoring yeah jacking off with a guy in the room but if he's snoring it's totally cool right yeah I mean that helps a lot if he didn't have a tougher time so are you allowed to have relationships were in there are you supposed to like steer clear that thing that can sort of distract you I mean there's no like hard and fast rule about that like they say like avoid getting in a relationship in your first year I got in the first year yeah I got into a relationship I mean I had like what if you found the perfect girl yeah sorry bitch my sobriety it happens just not like you know like relationships gone sideways is like the number one fuckin thing that makes people get loaded oh right that makes sense yes so it's good that I kind of like you know just worry about your sobriety but I had seven months and I got in a relationship with a chick who had like one year it was cool lasted for like ten months so when you're in there you're in there for 30 days this is the hardcore version and then you go from the 30 days to like a living situation and now how is that is that like a house like how's that work it was like an apartment complex at that point so it's in a part you got your own apartment then yeah but I stay Park no no skatepark yeah that was think I was a man I used to have fucking for apartments in one building now I got four dudes and one apartment so you had to live with other people you know there's two bedroom apartment and two guys nature what yeah why is that the deal because they want to make sure you're not alone by yourself yeah do deviations I mean perhaps you know I guess that's kind of the deal but like now what happened they're like and we would have groups from like you know eight or nine in the morning until 2:00 in the afternoon and then you're free to go and and I would be like skateboarding or whatever like trying to film some wacky shit or whatever you know like I didn't do like much like like in a professional sense and I was working with inna I was working on all this like 12-step shit you know so like I get like you know we do like the the searching and fearless moral inventory we're like we go through like you know basically like what have we done that like that we feel like a list of resentments make a list of fears and we make a list of shit we feel guilty about it's basically how it works and like you know I started off with just the shit I felt guilty about and I'm like oh like I was basically wrote a list of like the shit that I felt like you know the most terrible about and when when I went through it like and this is like Tony ones in recovery like avoid like making this mistake I treated it like I was just like you know putting myself on trial for being a bad person and like you know the whole point is just to figure out like what I'm here and you take an inventory and like you discard what's not helpful and you can keep what is you know you just discontinue shit that doesn't serve you but I'm like no I'm a terrible person I did this and this and this and this and then I'm like ah fuck you know and like I was just kind of like went in like a gnarly depression and felt like I'd fucking I don't deserve to live you know like whatever and like I've fucking checked myself into the psych ward number two you know while you were in recovery yeah I had thought you were going over I had like three months of sobriety and I went to one of my meetings and I was like I was like why all the work I'm putting into my fucking recovery on all I feel like I'm getting out of it is self-hatred I feel like I just can't get myself to the shit I've done I fuckin hate myself you know and this all came about from just doing an inventory on your past pretty much yeah I just had sad like it says in some of the literature man it says it like you know the inventory process will like you know bring about like self loathing for a lot of people when we take an honest look at like the fucking pieces of shit that we became like that's like a not an uncommon side-effects now like what what sort of tools they give you to to look at your past but not not be angry yourself not judge yourself well I mean I don't know I'm helping guys get sober I try and tell them look man this isn't a process of putting you on trial man this is just fucking figuring out what to stop doing no and that's the best thing I can say about it but when I was in that second psych ward like you know I was like like I wrote I wrote some letters to people who have felt the most fucked up about what I'd done you know and like and it actually kind of turned around where I was like you know I was like - today I'm fucking so thankful for the shit that I did that I felt that bad about because like no longer is it like oh I don't deserve to live because I did that and like for me today it's like I'm fucking desperate to not be that fucking asshole anymore you know and so it turned into you know and like when I first went in I was like the kind of thought like man this is gonna be my new thing I'm gonna get sober and like you know I'm gonna be like you know the world's gonna kind of owe me I'm gonna revive my career a little bit but once I got through that point of like you know sort of the the fuckin you know the dust settling and me being able to me being confronted with what I had turned into then it wasn't even about what can I get out of it you know it was just about I don't want to be that fuckin guy anymore and so I came out of that second rehab or that second psych ward and I was so desperate to not be that fucking piece of shit anymore and I was like dude I'm starting over and I went into the fucking like I went into another rehab like the fucking like God the hardcore you know and I was just like I'm doing this to be and I like I had my priorities straight you know and then I was there for two days and I've been said by the time I finish that it was six months and then I went into like the regular sober living and so that there's a lot of fucking money you're spending here yeah the last rehab was seven seventy five hundred and per month so at least high but yeah it fucking it was like thirty grand that second rehab I don't really the second psych ward I spent a lot of money on it man what are the guys that you were in the apartment with what those guys do for a living that they get afford to live in this shirt I paid the rent and I paid him each like a thousand bucks a month it's nothing why'd you pay him money for what well one guy was just said that like he was on call to edit whatever footage like that you know that that I wanted edited like to help me broadcast my downward spiral basically you know like I put some really upsetting videos so the people that you were living in the assisted situation like this is post the the major rehab right you were in the major rehab for 30 days and then the apartments different levels of rehab yeah like yeah and and I wound up like back and yeah I mean it was in the hole at one point I was in the house for a while and sharing a bedroom with the guy who snored and you know and I and and you know at the end I was in the apartment but it was all the same deal what did these guys do for a living that they could afford to like take all this time off of what the the sober living situation was like you know like that was like 1,000 bucks a month and that you know covers like your meals as well oh so it's kind of more cost-effective than if you're gonna try and find an apartment or anything like that and in the sober living situation it's like these guys work during the day and then would come there and stay with you if you don't work you have to do a certain number of hours of service work so I would volunteer at a nursing home whoa yeah there was dope man like I would just go ahead go fucking hang out with old people and I'd call the bingo numbers yeah and then and then I would like go and fucking move paramount like oh yeah guys I'm not gonna be able to call bingo tomorrow because I'm gonna be like drinking a fat guy's sweat so when did it feel like you were free of the monkey you know when I was like never mind never never right now you're not free I mean whenever like I just have like a way that I love my life you know that I still stay connected it's like a fridge man you know like if you unplug the fridge and then everything and it's gonna go rotten you know like you gotta fucking stay plugged in which means that like these things that that we do to stay sober like you just fucking keep like what kind of things well like helping other people stay sober is like the biggest thing you know you know like I you help you take people through their 12-step and who are these people that you take through and do you know them I mean whatever like you meet them sort of in the community you know like they'll ask you like will you be my sponsor and so when you have a sponsor they call you up in the middle of the night hey I'm thinking about doing heroin like that kind of thing talk about that it's better to call before you do it then after right because there's no point in talking to a load of dude and how often do you do this like how often you work with people I mean it depends like most guys like aren't like that active where they actually really call a lot but like you know I I'm always starting a guy you know there's always guys I'm starting off no and and just very few of them stick with it where they get like the guys I've taken all the way through the steps there's been two two-letter how many oh my god so out of a hundred people two of them have become totally sober I mean they've been like to say totally sober I mean you're totally sober as long as you know you're not loaded right totally like you are right now like you're going through the steps but then he's drinking again so you know I got one I got one guy that's been all the way through the steps that's still in do you think are you one of those people who thinks that if you were junkie that you have to be sober forever like you can't you can't go back to like you say if you had a heroin problem you can't drink they say once you become a pickle you never go back to being a cucumber so yeah like like there's no if I pick up a drink or a drug I'm fucked if I decided I'll pick up exactly where I left off but I'm and all I want is like to make sure I'm doing enough drugs that people are walking around my fucking apartment my house who are not actually there I know people that we used to be like heroin addicts that can have beer they could smoke a little way they can get away with it man then then power to that's dangerous why is it dangerous though I mean they're if they're free of it like okay here's a perfect example Anthony Bourdain he was a heroin addict he was a junkie full-on you still like to have a beer he likes to doesn't drink at home Perry I think is like that no you can't have heroin hey man power to him but for you it's not the way that my family is structured they're my lineage like dad was like a broken mold of his fam dad comes from a line of like academics like phd's scholars theologians zoologists like and he broke the mold of his family by becoming a businessman and a super successful one at that mom's side of the family everybody is alcoholic drug addict gambler suicide how'd your mom and dad meet I'm partying she was super hot you know but yes so like everybody everybody my mom's side of the family is either dead or dying from alcoholism I would say me and my cousins I guess I don't know my one cousins a mortician yeah I went to clown con of itself I went to Clown College he went to mortician school at the same time what's Clown College Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College for real what do you do this is an exploding shoe  what like when I was like you know I said I left the University of Miami I wanted to become a crazy stunt man right now and all I really accomplished like with that you know even with all my crazy skills is drinking bong water like I couldn't get a job like and in South she's like homeless for three years just getting arrested and fuckin hospital and it's almost for three years well I was couch surfer for three years I had the government test money or to try to test drugs on me for money what yeah and by me everything they do medical studies for like maybe medical studies for whatever you know like if it's gonna come in contact with the human body like if it's a toothpaste or something they gotta do a medical study but if it's a toothpaste you're not gonna get paid shit if it's fucking drugs for pigs and cows then based on how dangerous the study is the more money again and so I wouldn't sign up for to have drugs for pigs and cows testing on me with which I which I recently found out the drugs was banned jesus fucking christ he's like this was in like 19 in January of 94 you're like a house that you like you get to the back whoa this the last door hold on Jesus a whole nother house yeah it was like they they want like a you know 1994 like whatever the January of 94 and then they wanted to pass this drug through the FDA called RAC dopamine hydrochloride and the goal of that they didn't know much about it except they knew that it would make the cattle like more lean like it wouldn't like increase the muscle mass decrease the fat so in but it would work the opposite way of steroids somehow and like that was so that they could appeal to a more kind of health-conscious and market they could sell like leaner meat you know less fat but the thing is that if it's going to become legal then like by the virtue of the fact that when people eat the meat they're going to get like a minor trace of this drug and then in you know the meat now they have to not only test the drug on people but they have to test like how much can the people withstand so like they knew that it was gonna like increase our heart rates like you know and so what the target for the study was to give it to us until somebody in the study had their resting heart rate like laying down resting I'm like 150 beats a minute like and it turned out that I had like the fucking most badass heart in the study like like the only time I went over 100 was when the guy like monitoring my heart with like the ultrasound thing the you know like did they show the baby on the screen like he was like Tommy stories about like killing people in Vietnam or some shit like you know yeah it was like telling me like war stories and that got my heart like what kind of stories was he telling I can't remember it was just like he was in the war and he killed people he's telling you all he's doing all you're selling your heart the same guy when he was looking at it showed like your blood like going in your heart like red and coming out of your heart blue like on the screen it was really fucking cool and and I just had like this strong heart you know he said man what a squeeze you know I like you know what a squeeze did that in Austin Texas - oh yeah yeah that was in Austin Texas at this place called pharmaco AUTOSAR right ii told you I got in the van with that guy we drove ads in Northern California to Lake Tahoe to try and get jobs washing dishes at Squaw Valley to get free snowboard passes but it wasn't snowing so then we went to fucking Colorado and I got a job like cleaning a meet room at a supermarket and that sucked so I've got one with this other didn't drove to Austin Texas and slept on a roof until we got into the medical study and then we left with two grams and we were stoked and then like I you know wound up like getting a car and following the Grateful Dead and selling drugs and she's my gosh you know I was homeless for like three years and and like periodically I get my hands on cameras and do really fucked up shit but you know I was getting video footage but like ultimately like you know I just fucking it was really bombed it wasn't it didn't like after three years I couldn't take anymore and I reached out to my sister and she letting me move in with her in Albuquerque and I was like I would eat all their food and I wouldn't fucking work and no money and if I did have money I was loaded and I was loud you know so when my sister found out about Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College she's like dude this could be the way to get my brother the fuck out of my house like so like she told me about it like I can't home and she's like how are you getting to Denver by Monday and I I hitchhiked from Albuquerque to Denver and I got there in two rides and just fucking mine apeshit have you written a book uh-huh okay is this all in the book totally dude my book at my books like it barely made the New York Times bestseller list but that's because you didn't come on here first probably yeah yeah I can't if people had heard these fucking stories and knew that they were in the book oh my god it barely made the best New York Times bestseller list but what I'm most proud of my book is my masterpiece man like on Amazon it's got like the the key middle of average rating is a full five out of five stars fucking partial stars even people who hate me and want to hate my book give it a fucking fire did you write it yourself I worked for the writer on it but I don't think anybody has like been more involved in the collaboration like that's all so we bounce we've got Sal that shit back and forth and like to it I wouldn't never use that word I'm you know like my guy I worked my dick off on that your story's fucking insane it's like it just has layers upon layers of Tears and that's kind of like what's dope about the fuckin like the the comedy show man I'm just like really bummed like to retire like my shit you know how are you retiring it what do you mean well you know like you retire material once the fucking special company yeah we make new stuff of course yeah please it's a good opportunity for growth right you want to be a comedy factory not a comedy warehouse that's one way to look at it well your comedy should kind of represent who you are right now oh yeah 20 years ago it doesn't really represent who you're I don't fucking like I told you it's like the history is like super condensed you know like you know so that's like funny and with the story points I'd like on story points I have like when I say like about how I graduated from Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College but like I wasn't one of the clowns who got fuckin contract with the circus so I had to like borrow money to get a fucking Greyhound bus back to Albuquerque New Mexico where I hung my fancy clown costume in the fucking closet and sold shitty weed and the bags of fucking weed I saw did not weigh anywhere near what they were supposed to weigh but in my life fucking sucked really bad but after I got done ripping you off like at least I would show you like a fucking epic unbelievable cool trick like this one and then like on that point like well fucking bring like the table out and I'm gonna fucking show you the most incredible bar trick ever so when did you when did you put this book out at 2011 and did you go on the full tour do all these radio shows and I mean I did like radio tour like we'll see that must have helped right yeah I didn't do like terrible like um you need like a platform where you could just talk for hours and hours and hours right be cool if I had like a podcast here I just think that's what I'm saying right everybody's tired of amigo and dude you should have a podcast t-shirt that says dude you should have a podcast because I've seen so many people but  people took you up on it not every podcast is the Joe Rogan experience you know like it's the most fucking annoying question ever like hey will you do my podcast yeah they did not it's it's one of those things we got to kind of work at it it doesn't seem like you have to work on it like standard stand-up sort of the same way of course we're doing kill Tony last night that's one of the things I wanted to tell people like it seems like it's just you talking but you figure out how people are perceiving you and and that's that's a big part of doing a podcast too but you would be really good at it you really what I think she just did like one a week you'd probably it would take you a year or two to run out of stories like who knows it's like we're gonna tell us stories about should that happen or what's going on yeah dude do you have like a guy that you could do it with we could bounce shit off them you have a good buddy that you've thought about like five well with I've thought about doing it you know there's this fucking platform this this um what you might call it it's called you now one of these streaming things like periscope or meerkat but like but fucking this is so crazy like you now and like everybody who is a user of this platform like a like it has an account that they like put money into and so the way it works is like while you're streaming like you like their questions show up and think they want you to answer their questions so they'll like they have like different denominations of like money but they like give you like a cam girl now agents like bullied means doing it I tried it right and I just sat there like just telling stories to like the fans that were fucking watching and my by the end of I was on there for like 39 minutes and then I fucking ended the stream and it's like you just made $1,000 I feel like a fucking panhandler that is very cam girl asked yeah but if you did that all the time it would probably at least pay for a studio if you set up a studio so I mean for sure but you don't want see you don't want two people to have to pay to ask you questions I did this show and the guy who promoted the show I didn't know about it something to Bryan Callen set up this guy love that guy but these this guy had set it up and brought I love Bryan to but he doesn't pay attention to shit it's not like real good with details I had to ask him a bunch of questions about the show like hey man is it I was a DJ who's saying that he's spinnin records in between us a week is there a fucking break in between us was a DJ come on I'll check I'll check it's just you and I I get there it's not just me and him it's me Hamed is a fucking MC three local comics a girl's doing 20 minutes and it was a disaster we had to clean up this giant mess his podcast no no no it's a comedy show but the guy had made people pay extra to take pictures to meet us inside exactly and I said do you can't do that never I would never do that and you can't do that you can't do that it's fun I take pictures with everybody I'll do a theater now wait four hours and I'll shake pictures with a thousand fucking people you can't charge people an extra 20 bucks take pictures of me he did it on his own as a promoter and this is all shit that kaolin just didn't pay attention to the way the way I do that I'm Brian's cool about taking pictures oh yeah I know he is totally cool he just didn't pay attention he just let this guy handle everything whoo we didn't need in the first place you know what do you need use you know we don't need a promoter this is Twitter that's the promoter you know let people know you're there they show up it's not that hard like what does this promoter in quotes doing what is he doing he's just trying to get his friends on the show and trying to charge extra to take pictures it was stupid but right but that's a gross model like the model of like people having one day for VIP you know all that gross shit agreed the one thing though is the cell phone pictures like take fucking forever yes so what I do is I have my my website no one I'd take the pictures myself and like when the fucking I'm so good at it I stole your idea we saw that Jamie comes with me to some shows and takes pictures and we better it's better just way quicker third the time it's better to if you take them yourself because that way when the flash goes off you turn the camera around he can show the people their pictures so they can see it for like quiet quality control don't let them sit oh yeah cuz then they go oh my god take that again oh my god girls who like looking at photos of themselves and everything's great look oh my god I hate that picture do it again yeah no no no this is what you look like yeah but that's the thing is that like for me like I'm my camera so fast boom I know you don't like it how does I'm I don't like it so I'll take another one whatever dude my teeth look so fucking like and I just want the people to be really like HAP I'm getting like a bunch of cheese right man like I want them to be super happy with it because I know that when they fucking go to my website and pull it they're gonna post it on their fucking all their social media and then that's that's sort of my grassroots way of letting people know what the fuck I'm doing yeah no it's smart move and I started doing it right after I heard you did I think Brian told me about it yeah and a bunch of people do that now it's a girl does that too right doesn't Gabriel go something like that somewhere that's a smart move ok now like before I do my last fucking amazing stunt I'm gonna do every time I want to thank you guys for coming out and giving me a shot at stand-up and you know I'm gonna fuckin when I walk off the stage I'm not going anywhere I'm so I take a photo with every single one of you guys and here's how you get amigo to my fuckin website and I explain it real easy and I say and one last thing if you want to get out of here a little quicker the good news is I'm a New York Times bestselling author and I've got my fucking my book and I've got my fucking like my hats my shirts and if you guys want to get any of this shit then that puts you to the front of the line so having a March line and then a photo oh there's so many merch line first to get to the photo line through the gift shop and it's like just fucking Disneyland take a picture the people by March first you know and so like a lot of people would would be like oh fuck man like I don't wanna you know I know I Stella Mac if you don't want to get anything that's great but please just let me hang out like have a drink whatever like but and just fucking stick around and get that picture so I can thank you in person and a lot of people will think like man like you know I want to get a picture you know it wasn't to buy anything but like fuck I'll just buy something to get the fuck out here so you end up selling like way more work you know and nobody feels like you're a dick you know you still stick around and take a photo with everything everyone and their fuckers the only problem with selling things is you gotta deal with people like $20 dude like those people like oh just right how many don't buy Doughboy how many people are out there by selling fucking a one fucking side one color fucking shirt for 35 40 bucks like Andrew Dice Clay so it sounds like a fucking one color screen drinks five shirts yeah he actually brings like five shirts and the auctions them off oh sure it's like 500 dollars and that's not kidding yeah 20 bucks for whatever but I sign every last fucking the sighs say it like hey you know you can have a five-star New York Times bestseller that's autographed by the author in a picture and 20 bucks I don't feel bad about no looked it's great for a book you know book for 20 bucks is a great deal you think about the amount of time it's cost you know a book amount of time that you spend being entertained by that book books you're like the greatest bargain ever yeah take days to read you know yeah man that you have like as much as you do man because I really we gotta fucking get this Paramount Theatre in Austin but compact man I'm like that Joe is gonna be like that's my Showtime well you're gonna leave here and your phone's gonna be buzzing off the hook with your manager going did you say you're gonna light the Paramount on fire  a huge stage and like dude he told me he wanted to get out of the room don't worry the right white there was like 23 people that just died recently a fire on stage it just happened again where two people in the band even died where was it Sweden or something happened it's parked on the side stage and immediately the whole place pyrotechnics dude it's not worth it we used to have those in the UFC we stand these fucking giant like opening shows actually I don't think we had yeah we did have fire believe but in the joel de Oliveros like this famous fighter from brazil and he was fighting in Pride and they accidentally lit him on fire and he was on his way to the to the ring and you know they do the boom when you're walking through like this gateway they like the fight and they they fucked up the timing they lit this fucking dude on fire as he's on his way into the ring and burnt him and then they said the huh you'll be back we give you a money and so you know it took like a year off healed up his fucking 18 degree burns and came back a year later and fought again if you have anything like when you go to the doctor do you have anything that that bothers you still to this day from like a stunt I know that's my choice I have you know I'm in tours like the big teeth and shitty tattoos most of it but like my esophagus is fucked I got Barrett's esophagus it's like you know like one of the warning signs for esophageal cancer I'm just like like acid reflux and I don't know drugs and shitty living and vomiting do you take care of yourself now you know cigarettes I haven't smoked and you're a vegetarian now right you haven't smoked in seven years Wow so right when you start getting sober this yeah well I was five months sober when I gave up cigarettes I haven't smoked weed and since March 9th of 2008 so no coffee and thanks for not smoking weed for this one oh no I appreciate it no worries I wouldn't want to get you secondhand Lambay I said but although some people keep telling me that's bullshit but I know it's not a pot I just I don't really give a fuck of people drink around me but like the weeks I'm like breathing and like it's like the problem is it fucked it smells great it smells great in it I do believe secondhand smoke gets you high I don't think it gets you as high smoking pot but I think secondhand smoke still affects you so  vegan there's a whole other fuckin like major other door which other door like and this this I'm gonna fucking let people see this something at in Austin or at the show time but it's like you know it's like I'm good rehab it and like it's serving the whole deal and then it's like alright well it's great that I've learned how to live without fucking drugs and alcohol but like now I'm going to address my sex addiction I got was my deal I was like you know it's a mean joke I tell but you know I said I'm like I'm fucking 41 now I'm looking like my future and you know like I don't want to be 51 and falling apart and trying to hump everything that moves I don't want to turn into Pauly Shore I'm sure there's a few other guys just fucking ride that boat right into the rock I'll go with Lemmy before I would go with Vince Motorhead's like right right I just honestly believe you're married right it's like I really leave that like to be like happy you know like it's it's important to have fuckin I have a life partner and not run around tryin to fuck everybody and screwing them over you know I'm like that's the deal like I like how can I give so much of a fuck about animals that I won't fuckin eat an animal but I have no respect for women at all you know like it doesn't add up like so like on my fucking path and once I got into the the meditation like I've been doing Transcendental Meditation for two and a half years now and like I couldn't you know once I got into that like it was just like glaring like a fucking flashing red light like stop fucking screwing over chicks you know and and fucking using them up and throwing them away and just like you know like and whatever if I'm on the road like fucking hooking up with all the chicks it's just like it just became clear like that's pretty much like a path to being fucking miserable and it's a type of addiction yeah for sure like it's like anything outside like you know I've made myself like a promise I'm like okay now I'm like I want to fucking learn how to be in a healthy relationship because I feel like that time I'm gonna be happy and so I'm gonna fuck them from here on out I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fuck random chicks on that I'm gonna stop trying to get my dick sucked everywhere you know  got the fuckin stage I'm not gonna go anywhere I take a picture with everybody so the whole fucking audience basically gets in a line and it's an audition to see who gets to suck my dick fuckin the whole thing I mean I remember like that guy gets his dick sucked no fucking he's in the fuckin way there's a sex program you need somebody to oversee both of you guys I'm stoked I'm an because now I'm like fuckin yeah I'm like I got in therapy like the whole deal and which is hilarious because like you know my whole story arc you know is like it's it's pretty epic you know to go from where I was at to where I'm at now you know at the end I think at the end of the show I'm gonna have to fucking break out my old lightbulb trick and so I can slash my shit and bleed everywhere just just because like to fucking to try to fucking like about the end of my fucking show it's like okay so now I'm like a fucking vegan and you know like trying not to get my dick like clean and sober like fuck a healthy eater you know meditating like the least I can do is fucking bleed all over myself out sure you're a vegan because you love animals that's how I got into it okay but you feed your animals animals I do feed my dogs dog food that has fish in it and I just I just adopted a cat and the same thing right right it's terrible I did it for what if they don't it's not they have to be like like at the point of hunger we're like you're willing to eat your own fucking foot that kind of fucked up you know it's like you're choosing the animals that you love you're feeding these animals other animals that were captive in my movie if you want to be like super black and white like PETA PETA I mean that's the reality of animals right I mean I just I don't know I mean I hear that like the even in my fuckin canvas you know slip-on vans that there's some kind of animal products and then in the rubber right yeah a lot of like I'm not gonna not get photographed because there's animal products in the film you know like I just do the best I can and I feel better I feel better for doing it ya know it's is this the animal thing is weird when people are super self-righteous about killing animals and yet they have pets I've had a real issue with that with people I guess one spot that's why I like I'm like really fucking committed to not trying to tell other people what to do you know have your whopper man I'm here like eat all meat you want I don't give a fuck I'm just happier myself like you know trying to why vegan what about like farm-fresh eggs or things along those lines when I was with with fish and eggs like wow they went back to being fully vegan mm-hmm but you know because I'm fucking feel tired all the time I'm like man what is it I think it's my diet and I think it might fish and eggs then all of a sudden I'll have more energy but does it happen no I fucking had a sleep study it turns out I got sleep apnea is a CPAP machine no I use a mouthpiece  I'll turn you on to a doctor that's please local that makes a really good one a lot of people that have it it's your tongue for I have a fat tongue yeah yeah and this physician like to get cleared for a TV show and she was trying the light in the back of my throat she said do you feel like you sleep a whole night and wake up and you're still tired I'm like yes she says well then the back year through its really narrow and I think that's gonna cause it sleep back yeah the holes narrow yeah I have that too and also like I talked to me about getting an operation when they take out your adenoids and your tonsils and it's pretty intense and it's it's it sucks for like a week but then after it's over you have a larger hole and I have larger holes better for sleeping but this serves me well do you still get up to piss as much oh yeah if I have to piss if I try not to drink before I go to bed like right Friday but if I do yeah I got a fucking big fucking water pitcher next I bet on the floor so I just picked up a piss and put it back my friend Matt Serra who is a former UFC welterweight champion when I first met him he had this gym in Long Island and he used to sleep in the basement of his gym he's just teach and then go downstairs and sleep and here this jug right next to bed cuz finders will drink like gallons and water that day they just drink water all the time to flush our system out and he would just whip his dick out he goes I didn't even get out of bed I would turn sideways put my dick in the hole piss pull it out put the jug down right back this I did so great man this one black water pitcher like I don't have a very big dick or anything but like I don't even really have to tip over man because I gets got like about things where those classic kool-aid good to go so when you got a sleep study they put all the electrodes on your chest how many times did you wake up in an hour they said that it was actually like mild to moderate mm-hmm but but still I mean I know I gotta get that fucking mouth yeah it's not well you should lose weight I need an engine wait is the big one I think that's like what Joey Diaz Joey Diaz uses the CPAP machine but he didn't used to have to have that it's like when he got really big that's when he really developed because the more fat you have its salt closes everything off you know right when you see people with giant jowls well guess what that fats everywhere it's inside your face it's inside your neck and all that fat will close off the hole and when you lay back and your tongue falls over that hole there's no errands right I had to wake a guy up man I was on a plane this fucking guy was not breathing for like minutes at a time and then then gagging and coughing and then I'm wake him up but I talk to him when he woke up and I said hey man have you ever gotten checked for sleep apnea because he was it was snoring the most ungodly snoring so funny motherfucker wake up I'm gonna get sued like you're not worried about the kids who's got spiked on his head I tried this poor guy was freaking me out because he was making these noises and  then he would go back to like and then it would be nothing no sound and I'm awake because I was writing and it was on the long flight and I looked over at this guy and I'm noticing he's very overweight and it's just lying there like this no movement no breathing no no movement at all in his chest and all son like I mean he would go I mean I'm exaggerating over saying minutes but he would definitely go 40 seconds like I time did I forget what the time was but I remember being alarmed and I remember sitting up going okay I got to talk to this guy and I had my mouthpiece with me because I bring it in my dad moves your lower jaw forward no no no no mine doesn't mine actually just depresses my tongue down and it keeps my tongue from falling back over my ear hole it depends on what kind of sleep apnea hmm I don't know what's the difference I don't know Joey would know more than anyone because Joey's got it real bad Joey needs the CPAP like he has to have air blow in it I love them too it's probably smoking weed right now I'm paranoid but anyway so I the guy was like kind of stirring and moving and when he finally was like opening his eyes and looking around I talked to him and I had like a long sit-down with him I showed him the mouthpiece I'm gonna go dude you could die I go you you hold your I was gonna film it but I thought it would be rude just film you but I mean you're holding your breath for a long time if you ever talk to anyone about it it's like no you know my wife tells me I snore I go dude you don't just snore you're like choking you know and there's a lot of people you don't know what happens when you go to sleep you're out and you sleep you're out and when you're out like that you're not getting any oxygen when you sleep you don't get into heavy REM sleep you're gonna get into those deep cycles you just skirt the edges and then you wake up cuz your body's gasping in panic mode and so you'll wake up after like eight hours of sleep and still fucking exhausted every day I feel like I could go back to bed right when I wake up you really could lose weight I mean you know that's a big social Joey Joey I mean that's a big thing with Joey's way way way overweight and he got down a while just like you did I mean Joey lost like 80 fucking pounds at one point but he's he gets the energy from that CPAP like he feels way bed like he travels with one he has this machine that he travels with that he has to check I mean so he always has to check his luggage because his carry-on is his CPAP machine so he doesn't go anywhere without checking his luggage every flight he takes Joey brings that machine with him that is his fucking that's his security system you brought up earlier you brought up Greg Fitzsimmons I don't Cosby thing what do you think about because I it makes me feel out weird I don't like it it's misguided I love Greg but I think it's misguided and for folks who don't know what we're talking about Greg has decided to start stealing Bill Cosby's material and doing it openly so he does these classic Bill Cosby bits and then he lets everybody know in the middle of it that he's stealing Bill Cosby's bits to take away from him what is most precious but it doesn't really work because it doesn't you don't like if someone tries to steal some shit off of like shiny happy jihad or something like that like it's already out it's already on CD I did it and you know fucking 2006 like if you're stealing you're not taking anything away from me you're just you just you know you're just selling yourself short by stealing so like if Greg does Bill Cosby's material you don't ever take it away from him it's already recorded these are like he doesn't even do that material anymore so I don't know I don't think it's really effective it seems like you're taking something negative and being negative about it it just doesn't seem it and I also think it's just opens the door to people go well Greg stole Bill Cosby's jokes you know and but he says it on stage they're stealing it he lets people know in the middle of it that he's stealing Bill Cosby's but Greg Fitzsimmons steals Bill Cosby's bits now he does he's doing it on purpose to try to take something from Bill Cosby like this is the idea behind it I think it sounds like Bill Cosby would be super psyched on that because it's like wow I'm getting credit for being funny and it's distracting people from Vegas  totally true that's completely defeating yeah I think it's a gimmick I mean III see what he's like he's genuinely thinks the guy's disgusting right it's general I mean I glorify his comedy but yeah I mean I don't get it either I don't know I just I don't know maybe if I had him on and Greg oh hell monsoon and he's gonna be on soon I guess we were talking about doing something within the next couple weeks so maybe he'll explain it better I just I wouldn't want to have anything to do with it you know you know I'd say this up fascinate there's some lady that was on who was a legal expert who was discussing it and she said he might be the most prolific serial rapist in history which is fucking insane it's insane to look at it that way that this guy mr. Huxtable you know the fucking guy from the TV show the guy who had the squeaky clean comedy the guy who did the bit about you know the football players saying hi mom to his son on TV this guy was like wholesome mr. America in a sweater but they said none of these girls like the next morning well god what the fuck happened he raped me I am going to to the police this is all you know kind of like wishy-washy like yeah I kind of felt weird that night but no one really went right to the police though did they um I don't know I don't know it seems weird it sounds like if it seemed weird to me seems like a lot of people just kind of I don't know well listen man if you're a girl okay look at it this way you're some young girl who's trying to make it in show business and you're you know you get brought into his office because you know his you know he knows your parents or something that that was a lot of the situation like he there was one of one situation was there was like a modeling company and he would contact the Milan company to get people on his show like he was looking to cast but roles that didn't even exist  yeah he would bring them into his office and drugged them like would you like a cappuccino and give them a cappuccino and fuck them I mean just drugged them I don't know it seems saying if that were to happen though like four hours this girl's good I just went there for an interview I had a cappuccino and he fucked me like you'd go right to the zone this is why this is why no because I think I was gonna say is like these these are young girls that are probably completely overwhelmed that they're even in his presence like they can't even believe that they're meeting Bill Cosby so you're insanely starstruck and the fact that he's touching you puts you into a state of shock like you're fucked and then you're confused because you wake up and you're you were drugged you don't know what happened and then you're embarrassed and horrified of it I mean there's so many extremes mr. Huxtable exactly it's like he's this is before the internet man you know for girl like that if that happened today a girl could go on her Facebook page and say today I went on an audition with Bill Cosby and he drugged me and raped me and like whoa like BAM that takes off and he goes viral but back then man if you go to the fucking police they might not say shit or money they might go to Cosby and Cosby might sue you but you got to realize some women did and in 2005 he actually paid off women and he that's why this all got more serious lately is because they released the transcripts and the transcripts said that he admitted that he had drugged these girls he admitted it so this this did go to cops and it didn't go out to the public so it's like it's not kind of weird it's just the amount of power and money this got I mean Bill Cosby is like a billionaire I mean the amount of money that guy has is insane and the amount of power that kind of money has were you talking about just teams of lawyers that just try to figure on any sort of attack that they could do to try to mitigate any of the issues that are going on with people accusing him of all this crazy you know rape shit it's like he fought it for a long time he hasn't really publicly denied any of it no he hasn't denied it at all he hasn't denied it all he just doesn't talk about it you know he one of the weirdest things that he said he did this one interview and he said in all my years of show business I've never seen anything this yeah well that's called free speech this is what's going on now look you you everyone can talk now like now people can get online and talk about crimes that you committed it's you can't hide behind lawyers anymore you can't threaten them you know you can't you you and you're a girl you're barely paying your bills you know you're barely getting by and he offers you twenty thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars just shut the fuck up and you have to sign some written agreement that says you never speak about this again you take that money that's what they do and that's what they did in 2005 and I don't know how much they got paid but it's probably even more than that probably a million I mean when you when you're worth what that guy's made in his career I'm who knows what he's got left but but someone a hundred thousand here or a hundred thousand there for a guy like that there's nothing he could silence a lot of shit but just keeping people quiet with money you know and that's probably what happened when things came up me I don't know and then there's also people feet with fear of being blackballed you know being blackballed from show business when you're a struggling actress and you're barely getting by the difference between Bill Cosby talking badly about you and accusing you of being a liar like who's gonna listen to you and who's gonna listen to him they gotta think that most people gonna listen to Bill Cosby and that could wreck your career before it ever gets started just sink your ship and it seems like a lot of these girls that he preyed on were trying to make it in show business that was a big part of like what he would attack he would go after these girls that were trying to become actresses and he was like a mentor figure that was like the angle that he was presenting stark shit man get on that I take one piss Simmons and his Bill Cosby strategy yeah it's a little misguided I think I don't know I mean maybe Greg's got a better point maybe we need to let him articulate it it's the darkest thing in all of the history of stand-up comedy I think I mean or close to it you know I mean what else there was that Vince champ guy that was raping college girls and he got caught he would say like horrible shit to them like pray for me and stuff like while he's fucking them that guy's in jail for the rest of his life Cosby is just out running around I mean it doesn't seem like there's any charges that are being put up against him and as far as I know there's only one woman that the the rape happened inside the statute of limitations I don't know what the statute of limitations is but I think it's like that's it that seems fucked I think a rape I think it's seven years but that's kind of like whoa you know it's a little wishy-washy meaning like if you if you rape somebody and you have great proof eight years later I'm sure there's still gonna I don't know I don't think that's the case I think a statute of limitations is pretty rock-solid like once it yeah yeah it's not it's it's law you know I don't know it's fucked up we've talked about that so many times it's so it's a subject that's been beaten to death but if it seems like it's so significant that you kind of have to beat it to death cuz it's hard to believe magic that was like your dad or something like that imagine you know if you found out your dad was a fucking serial rapist or your mom even your mom's drug and dude that sucking their dicks I saw you do about if your son came home from school and told told you that his teachers dick  knows that he called the cops my son called the police cause uh how does someone ever find out that a female teacher molested kid one of those pussies has to open his mouth okay there's a giant difference she no woman molesting a boy and a man molesting a girl I don't think it should be encouraged but it's certainly not the same right did you hear about anonymous releasing all the KKK members information supposedly there's a lot of US senators I applaud you anonymous I feel like an anonymous overall across the board does more good shit okay I know I hear very very you bad accusations on their part almost everything they do I agree with I love it like it good fuck the KKK fuck all those crazy fucking Stone Age assholes who give a shit about the origin of birth of your great-great-great grandparents you know you're not pule you're not of the pure race it's gonna be interesting though because supposedly there's some ferguson police that are involved in this and it the whole list officially gets released and i think next week or this you want Browns on it  well they can just put your name on it man somebody wanted to fuck with you steve-o's in the KKK what yeah you you've you've kind of morphed it's really fascinating I mean seeing you go from being this wild crazy ketamine snortin psychopath jumping off roofs and shit and damaging buddy to being this vegan who's trying to live a kind life and trying to be nice to people and you don't want to randomly hook up with girls cuz you want to have a meaningful relationship and then taking care of animals and fuck SeaWorld it's really amazing to see these become this every once in a while I gotta do something pretty fucked up just to make sure that  well I didn't meet you until you were sober right you know I missed the crazy train I've kept it pretty crazy sober to them ya know no doubt yeah I mean just explaining what you're planning on doing it to Paramount before they found out about it do you think there's gonna be a jack house jackass for K or something like that I don't think so man but old and fucking injury last one was so great how I can I'm working my dick off to get my own movie oh yeah yeah like sort of sort of like the bad grandpa format but so my thought was bad grandpa good oh yeah that was a funny funny funny I cried when he got his dick stuck in that machine oh my god it was one of the funny that was a funny fucking movie that I was really good I don't think got enough read it I really don't think you got as much credit as it deserved I think it did well it was number one but it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life and when you talk about like funny all-time movies very few people bring up bad grandpa I think they should I think it's a goddamn epic movie there's some kids shitting on the wall and when he's dancing that kids awesome I love the kid in it when he goes to the black Club and he's with all the ladies and he's dancing come on okay it's fucking epic movie yeah should you have a movie worked out or do you have a night tell you much yeah I'm gonna like keep the cards close to chest yeah dude but but I got a deal with the yeah big-time movie producer guys oh snap yes now weird and I got and taking it and like getting it written and get the director and then take it to the studios kind of deal so we were talking about this this damage it's done really the fuck on back we're talking about the damage you've done to your body before you went off to pee and you said esophagus other than that like pretty margins and joints and back that joints are all good that's crazy what about Knoxville is he okay he's gotten some back issues I think so from that bowl I wish when he went blindfold the bull particularly her Don I think that one thing one thing that did a lot of damage to him was early early on dropping in on the skateboard halfpipe I think I'm one of the big vert ramps mm-hmm and he just like I mean just fell straight to the flat bottom and like I remember like hearing that like you know he turns his like turning the car like hurts his shoulders fuck he definitely did more damage because like he didn't have like the benefit of growing up like falling off a skateboard sort of learning how to fall down you know like when he'd like a lot of us are like sort of you know I mean I'm like you know sort of circus clown combate you know lifelong fuck by trades yeah so yes I'm kind of more like like I'm better at falling down without getting hurt knocks it falls down I just meet hitting the ground in the worst way which is why his shits always the best you know oh oh yeah that makes sense because you can do flips and all that shit you know how to fall with your body yeah more like a cat when it's down do it and Knoxville is just you know I think that he's probably in worse shape but then again at the same time I think that uh you know he takes good care of him sobbing you know and I think maybe he's done some bending I get some disk issues I don't know mmm yeah I've got a gang of those I did my own stunts for this accidentally did my own stunts for this Kevin James movie I wasn't excited I suck at riding bikes I had to ride a bike and I had hit him with a flag which Kevin James is zookeeper and I was the guy that I'm telling me about is when I did that movie which guy Todd garner oh the guy who the producer I know Todd yeah dude so I had to hit the brake while I was like riding a bike and I was hitting him with this flag but I'm hitting the front brake and when you you know you hit the front brake if it locks you go flying over the top and I did it like three times ask if we wind up using that in the movie instead of the stunt man because I just want to go fucking fly but I'm pretty good at falling there's a life-long you know martial artist so although like that I knew when I hit the ground that you can't just hit the ground you gotta kind of like roll with but you really have a real strong appreciation for stunt people when you do something like that because I go well I got through this luckily without getting hurt but if I had to do this every fucking day or you know every week some new thing where you've fallen off of a building or jumping off of a fucking moving car that potential for damaging yourself is super high now you hear about those people dying it's always like some movie that no one's gonna give a fuck about some racing motorcycle seen a Steven Seagal movie and someone dies you know I mean you got a when you watch those crazy action movies think about that appreciate the fact that those people they literally put their physical health and their life on the line for your entertainment you know I didn't think about it too much until I just fucked up and fell a few times on a bike in a movie you know it's like those guys do it on purpose all the time yeah that's right ma'am it's fucking hard gig man that's a harder said the fucking paramount all right ladies and gentlemen let's wrap this bitch up steve-o steve-o on Twitter Paramount Theater

Pierre at UFC 69 I do believe that the heavy favorite if I had to bet my life on it I'd have to bet on George st. Pierre he's been more successful he's been more impressive Sarah didn't exactly work his way through the ranks and only received a title shot for competing on the UFC's reality show The Ultimate Fighter after defeating Pete Spratt Tony Carter and a controversial decision win over Chris Lytle he was given a shot at the welterweight title it was supposed to be GSP s first title defense since winning the championship against Matt Hughes at UFC 65 but Matt Serra had other plans  after hurting GSP Sara didn't let up until the fight to stop [Applause] Sara and GSP fought again a year later with GSP dominating Sara and reclaiming the welterweight title and a few honorable mentions Nick Diaz surprised everybody at pride 33 by not only beating Takanori Gomi but winning via gogoplata while completely stoned he tested positive for the Gomi fight and they said there was so much weed in his system when they tested him that he had to be high when he was fighting Mike Russo pulled off an unexpected upset after knocking out Todd Duffee then followed up with one of the most brutal hammer fists ever seen in MMA Holly Holm shocked the world by knocking out Ronda Rousey due to copyright

"C4Uc-cztsJo": "so why do people reply to spam emails you know I mean it's all it isn't they're given that they are preposterous and they are preposterous I got your contact for a South African health officer in Ghana I find that unlikely I need to move with a thousand carats of polished diamond equally unlikely no this transaction is a hundred percent risk-free and dos not attract any danger commander Koroma it's funny isn't it I mean this is ridiculous right and it's funny that anyone would reply to it but if you think about it this is actually rather clever because by making the scams ridiculous ideally for the scammer the only people who are going to reply are the most gullible people and me I said I'm in  then he told me to email Liberty law firm at law firm code at UK which is amazing email address they should send me your phone number so I gave him the phone number of Goldman Sachs the bank I  wanted him to think I was rich everybody should have done that because the next theme I got said J's reach I'm not sure you are real at all  you gave me phone numbers of Bank which I call and they say that you are not real they don't know you they even advised me who hi  I'm an army intelligence set of things I didn't know what to say I said look there was never a shred of doubt in my mind that I was dealing with men intelligence how can I prove to you that I'm real I mean how can you prove that you're real in truth how can any of us play over here PS what are you sending me I forgot I said the contents of the consignment is a thousand karats of rough diamonds worth 7.5 million dollars you and I will use it for investment in Europe I said that's amazing what are we going to invest them I'm not much of a stock market player myself but I've got a strong hunch Thomas is gonna be there  kind of a picture the consignment will guys yes I can boom  [Applause] enigma right then he said send me your ID passport driver's license or any any of your valid ID  [Applause] it was valid at the time then he said you were need to set up an account with our bank and pay the fee this is quite common like there he has multiple email addresses he pretends like it's another company and I thought about I thought okay I'll do that and I thought I'd throw something into the mix just to see what he did with it so I said look I'll set up a new account with your bank there's an offer of a free toaster on at the moment and I've got my heart set on it he said don't worry about getting a toast  I'll be the gist of that and then he told me to contact this Bank now the bank is masquerading as Royal Bank of Scotland right but what I love is their email address is info at Royal BS which i think is perfect and then he said don't delay I don't have much days here on earth I said what do you even know  [Applause] I have not seen anybody that is more unserious as you are even if I die soon do you have to mock me with it I said I had no idea we were talking about your dad he said what were you thinking I was talking about am I going to Mass  I said where's man who is that with the toaster  he said sorry I mean Mars one of the nine planets of the solar system  I just think if he doesn't know it's gonna be a shock I figured I'm done with this guy I'm gonna send an email to Royal BS right so I sent him an email I said look dear Royal Bank of Scotland I'm writing to you about some bling leftenant commanders have even me and a free toaster you're giving me for opening the account they go back to me very quickly they say please send us the federal account opening for and there is no free toaster raja ramesh head of customer care  I thought these guys are good via customer care are you sure be like that I was getting a free gift for opening the account sort of costumes do you do he said there is no Bonanza going on and that that this frame is an odd choice of women I think right what must have happened is he must have looked had the work competition in his language I found a synonym which was bonanza Bissell struck me as odd and then he said and even if there was conditions would apply I'll be honest that pissed me off because you cannot tell me the conditions apply to a competition that I literally just made up so what I did is I opened up Photoshop and I took a day and I sent them something I made and send them something so this is what I said I said then how do you explain this and this is a this voice  free toaster regaining you account so stubborn and then check it out guys no conditions apply [Applause]  let's go get out of that and he did he said that do not include rob Bank of Scotland worldwide I said what are my options I could do with it you cat said we will appreciate it if you do not but not this gift me again because you are  I said just be clear you're saying if I bring it up again I won't get it if I don't believe I will are you just saying I won't go at all  please stop talking of a free toaster aah  I thought of almost done it right before miss I'm always good part of me just once really wants to kind of annoy them almost as much as they annoy us and I don't about you but to me that sounds like a broken man do do this at home do do this at home I mean don't use your own email address it's of a fake email address but do you this Oh home because not only do you have a chance to to stop them doing actual damage but it's also a chance to to have fun to play that being said I thought I'd back off a bit I said of course I shan't rap again you have my word  so what we want from you is to do the right

next act we might stick it to Penn & Teller  most people think you're either born creative or you're not that is so far from the truth creativity is like anything it's a muscle and the more you use it the better you become with it I got into creating magic about eight nine years ago my claim to fame is an item called pyro which is a wrist born fire shooter they think pyro was a big hit because who wouldn't want to shoot fireballs from their hands I don't create things to fool normal people that can be pretty easy my job is to not only fool mainland but get magicians to buy products that I create well tonight it's me bringing in Penn & Teller or something I'm positive they've never seen before and it's just about me standing there trying to fool them [Applause]  a randomly selected member of our audience please welcome the inventive magic of Adam Wilber Thank You Alison thanks so much what's your names Tony I'm Adam pleasure to meet you nice to meet you can I borrow a dollar bill from you I do have a dollar beautiful you from Chicago I am all right that's where I would keep it - perfect perfect Tony I'm gonna have you do me a favor I'm gonna have you sign this and I'll put a little box so you know exactly where to write for me so if you put your name right there that would be excellent now a lot of people ask me why I do magic for a living it's a kind of an honest and interesting question and the answer is pretty simple for the money see how easy that is when you're a magician now Tony we're gonna get back to your bill in a moment but first since we're on this beautiful stage I figured I'd show you something cool would you like to see a magic trick perfect coincidentally you have exactly the right amount  welcome to Vegas my friend now before we get to that I want to tell you a little bit of a story about how I got interested in magic when I was a kid see I used to live down the street from a magic shop and the guy behind the counter was an interesting dude but he used to do the most incredible things with money I'll show you the very first thing he showed me when I walked into his shop he had this little wooden paddle it didn't look like much to me it had pieces of paper on each side with money signs on them that's three here three here again doesn't look like much until he did the magic shake watch careful Tony it looks like this and now those paper have turned into pennies that's three here and three here I was stunned to silence myself I get it now this was at the time the most incredible thing I had ever seen in my entire life keep in mind I was six years old right but so incredible that I bought the effect I went to my house and I spent the better part of a week changing paper into pennies and laughing to myself like a crazy person the entire time now at the end of a week when I had enough money I went back to his shop and I said to him what do you have that's a little more substantial than maybe pennies and he brought out little colored sheets of paper and four of them to be exact at this point I wasn't too impressed but he said wait till you see what they can do so Tony watch careful we're gonna take four of these pennies I'm gonna place them right in the middle of this trash paper we'll call it that for now very fairly all I'm gonna do is fold them into a little bundle of trash paper essentially now at this point as a little kid I wasn't too impressed much like our audience here today nothing happened just yet until he did the magic shake he opened this up and to my surprise he had five times the money he started with watch careful because those pennies have turned to nickels  so of course I said ring me up I went back to my house and I spent the better part of two weeks changing paper into pennies and pennies into nickels laughing to myself like a lunatic the entire time now this time when I went back to his shop I didn't even have to ask him what was next cuz he had this little brass cap already sitting there waiting for me didn't look too impressive but for this can I have your hand to demonstrate put your hand right in here and a little higher I'm gonna take the four nickels and I'm gonna place them on the back of your hand now it's important you keep your hands steady is if you don't those nickels fall off into my hand now I'll do this as slow and fair as I can Tony can you see the nickels on the back of your hand yes I can can you feel the nickels on the back of your hand yeah and can you see this empty weird looking brass cap I see that weird cat watch this we put the cap over the nickels and we wait now of course we need that magic shake this time I do it Oh beautiful and a shake for you perfect now Tony be honest does your hand feel a little bit lighter than it did not so much see it should because dimes are lighter than nickels or dimes from for nickels thank you very much you so I went back to the magic shop and I asked the guy do you have anything with foldable money something I could actually make a living with and what he showed me next changed my life this thing right here at this moment not too impressive but let me show you what it does Tony is this your bill that is the one that you gave to me yesterday I appreciate that thank you very much now we're gonna put this right here now watch careful all we do is slowly roll this and you'll see that one dollar bill change from a one to a hundred thank you  20 can you verify that your name is written on the back of that hundred that's my name that is my name now penny teller I have a feeling you might think I'm using some sort of word play or trickery but I can assure you I'm not see this is Tony's bill because this is Tony's signature so Tony thank you very much  Tony I'm gonna have you take us home compliments with me don't worry I can make many many more let's all give Tony one big round of applause  [Music] [Applause] I love that creativity process of trying to make a problem that's both entertaining and fun to watch but also fooling at the same time do you have more tricks in the pipeline that you're sort of I do have a few that are far-fetched ideas but I think that's where the best magic comes from thinking way outside of a box of impossibility and then whittling it down to something that's a happy middle ground you know you like wake up in the middle of the night would like an idea I gotta try it yeah anyone here always keep a notebook by your your bedside and it's one of the the biggest keys I can give you okay looks like the guys are ready guys I want to say before anything that magicians are never classy they always do these things or they change the dollar bill into a hundred and they change it back and do some sort of laying joke about keeping the money or keep not've itself given the guy the hundred dollar bill as a souvenir is classy and the way to go we've never seen a magician do that  now we all know these words they're just gonna rattle off really quickly we all know paddle moves cap and pens and Mbutu money mystery we all know those and those are done beautifully in a really nice routine but the question is how did you get the signature on the gun and there are two solutions that we could think of and I want to ask you one question before that and that is can we look into that Halliburton case you have there please okay we're not gonna we just we just want to know if we could share we have a huge amount of information once you said that and if you were bluffing on that you're a genius just a genius so I think that that little question-and-answer gave us a little window into and into how you might have done this trick a little bit of a way to frame the whole thing and and get a very clear idea of how you ended up giving that guy a one dollar bill turned into a hundred with his signature right on there is a wonderful wonderful actors thank you very much but no window whatsoever I know where you're going absolutely not no in the world shape or form now and we can look in the case yes  [Applause] hey wait Oh exciting people oh there's no window in there yeah I don't know what that means  [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]  the situation both y'know see that coming in and clearly neither did Penn and Teller let's see if we have another fuller on our hands after the break [Applause]",

see you guys as always this is one of my favorite podcasts that we ever do and this is very timely because first of all the big New York Times article about the possibility of a comet hitting Los Angeles the preparations for what they would do if a comet hit Los Angeles and the comet known as Donald Trump that's hit the United States and he's even got the hair it's just the whole things I mean if the end of the world was coming boy it's all on the wall you know the writings all there it's kind of crazy mm-hmm so what's the latest and the greatest well the latest and the latest and the greatest is like I mean last year when we sat down with you I think it was last November mmm yeah it was almost a year got floated in the discussion the idea that this really important comet research that's going on which is just changing our whole view of history and prehistory and of the future of humanity but it would be good to make a film about this and crowdfunded I actually mentioned that to the scientists and they said what we really need is more funding for our research and so they've inspired by basically by your show they have put out a crowdfunding campaign which is linked on my on my website it's the comet research group and it's it's a big story right now so how can people find it really quickly it's IndieGoGo well now that research much quick away just go just go to my website Oh Graham Hancock calm and there's a revolving banner which is the comet research group click on that and you're in this beautiful ok Graham Hancock calm and then crowd funding for comet research and so what are they were trying to put together well they're they're wanting to see the thing is these guys have actually not had any official funding this is a group of major highly credentialed scientists who for the last decade have been investigating the extraordinary story of a massive comet series of comet impacts on the North American ice cap twelve thousand eight hundred years ago that is the the global Cataclysm that wipes out a whole civilization from from prehistory so that's why it's of interest to me they're not coming at it from that point of view they're coming at it from rediscovering something that we've lost about ourselves something is really important to understand the role of cataclysms in the story of the earth and they need to do much more research they need to go back to Greenland and look for the nano diamonds in the in the Greenland ice cores they need there's a there's an ancient city which they're not revealing the name of which they're pretty certain was wiped out by a comet impact about four and a half thousand years ago they want to go there and investigate that so there's a lot of fieldwork they need to do to drive home this hypothesis and to frankly put down the opposition because there's been so much opposition to this idea from people with vested interest in other theories that that's why these guys have not got funding so the only place they're going to get funding to do this further research is from members of the general public and that's what we're hoping that will will happen it's called the comet research group there's a banner on my site and all the links are there to their crowdfunding to their website which is full of masses of scientific information and to their Facebook page as well it is a very unusual thing the the fact that we know that comets and all sorts of various large objects have impacted the earth we see the craters we know they exist but it's so rarely discussed it's so it's so strange if it wasn't for this article in the New York Times I can't remember one the last time and that it even came up and it's such a huge issue it's a massive issue it's a massive issue both Randall and I have really you know given a great deal of thought to there's nothing rattled you that the point is that catastrophes are the untold story of our past we were given a little we're givers a little hint of it February of 2013 Chelyabinsk siberia reverie of it yeah yeah now that was just a little cosmic spec came in I was about fifty feet in diameter which is about um and it came in at a fairly low angle it blew up nearly eighteen get that thing right in front you right in front of me like this yeah if you flat it out it's usually easier how's this just better yeah all right there we go so it came in I think it exploded twelve miles about 20 kilometers up in the atmosphere but it still enough to damage thousands of buildings and injure 1500 people another thing about that one is if it had been slightly larger if it had come in at a slightly steeper angle a little bit higher velocity you could have had thousands of fatalities rather than just injuries and that would have been major headline news at that point as it was it's already forgotten but you do remember yes oh yeah oversee we may even talk I've talked I believe indeed we did I think most videos of it you know it's fascinating is Russia has so many of those trail cam and nut trail cam um dash cam photo cameras that's right because they have so much insurance fraud apparently over there slam into each other all the time and they want to record it so we're fortunate enough to have so many of those videos because of that which puts it on the record whereas other otherwise it would it would not be I think I think people don't they don't like to talk about cataclysms and catastrophes and actually nor do I nobody wants a horrible Cataclysm to occur but this is the point which is that the prospect of a comet or asteroid Cataclysm on the earth is actually much higher than has been told to us up till now and something can be done about it it doesn't have to be the end of the world we don't have to you know say okay it's all over forget about it quite the contrary this is this is just something that would be prudent and rational for the human species to do and amongst many other imprudent and irrational things that we focus on instead we should be focusing on a bit on this well at least just to heighten awareness of it and and also the possibility that we've been nailed a bunch of times and we've forgotten about it and this is this is the big thing that you've been dealing with your entire career this skepticism about past civilizations I mean I got into it with Michael Shermer who's a friend of mine who's a very famous skeptic I got into him with it yesterday because I posted that you were going to be on and he started chirping something about civilizations 12,000 years ago where's the evidence on like to do you don't even you're saying this and you don't even know about gobekli tepe so I sent him gobekli tepe and literally like five hours later he wrote something claiming that while that was made by hunter-gatherers it was all just really to sort of suit he narrative so he doesn't know that no one knows nobody knows that they're so determined to keep the existing model and and when new evidence comes in which can't be explained by the existing model they just try to explain away the new evidence and not not think maybe it's time to change our theory you know this is this is the unfortunate thing but cataclysms a global Cataclysm the massive event that happened twelve thousand eight hundred years ago the Younger Dryas impacts which were a series of comet impacts on the north american ice cap this accounts for why we don't have a lot of evidence hard evidence over 12,000 plus year old civilization because it went down in that catastrophe it was wiped out I've been trying to amass the evidence actually that complements what Graham is doing and it really answers that question the Schirmer brought up and it's a legitimate question where where's the evidence but I'm quite sure the Schirmer is not really educated in the extreme events that have really taken place on this planet in the last ten to twenty thousand years um and what that would do to any kind of evidence it maybe while we have some time here today I've brought a few things to try to convey some sense of how extreme some of these changes have been and how one would actually be quite shocked to find anything existing in the aftermath of these events well Michael Shermer is a brilliant guy and I don't mean the shit on him but but what what is disturbing to me is that his knee-jerk reaction to this without having any research at all in the subject not knowing at all about gobekli tepe which was discovered in what the 90s yeah 96 I mean so this is to me this is something that I've looked at because of you guys in great depth when I read your book I was just completely enthralled with this idea of history having some sort of or rise and fall and civilization having these resets so I've been absorbed in it for a long time but what's fascinating to me is people that consider themselves to be skeptical or you know or I mean he's a skeptic professional insurer but many people who question anything that's outside of what they've been told as soon as they hear any sort of a theory outside of what they were told they immediately call quackery happy anything and this but it's it's a weird knee-jerk reaction to something especially when you talk about asteroids that is very real part of our past we have a ton of evidence I mean there's actual craters that you can look at on earth the moon which has no atmosphere is littered with them and if we look at the moon as a model for what could possibly have happened to earth or at least you know some of them obviously with the moon having no atmosphere it's going to get hit a lot more than we are sure but still I mean this is a very real situation that this this solar system you know at least as far as we know the only solar system has to deal with this but we know this is a real issue maybe we've seen impacts what it's like you just said on the one hand you have earth scientists looking at the earth and what they're realizing is that the earth is pockmarked with scars and each of these scars represents a tremendously powerful catastrophe that's happened in the history of the earth now that's accepted by mainstream science that that major catastrophes have happened in the history of the earth but where this thing now is about to come full circle is the recognition that these kinds of catastrophes have also influenced the rise and fall of civilization and a lot more a lot more extremely than then has been recognized up to this point and while geologists and earth scientists are looking at the surface of the earth and realizing that itched into the surface of the earth or imprinted into the surface of the earth are hundreds of scars of which undoubtedly are only a small percentage of the total that exist at the same time astronomers are looking out into near-earth space and discovering that we cohabit space with a lot of stuff it's not as empty as we thought just within the last six or seven weeks we've had two close flybys of previously undiscovered that really of previously undiscovered asteroids this the point is NASA keeps saying well is you know there's we've counted 1,650 asteroids and none of them are going to hit the earth in the next hundred years well yeah that's true but what about all the ones they haven't counted which are estimated to run into hundreds of thousands and which haven't been seen yet and what happens is we see them roughly ten days before they pass the earth that is not enough time to do anything about them but we have time if we're prepared to be rational and reasonable as a civilization to take care of this issue now when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of near-earth objects that are flying around like what what are the things that could be done to protect Earth you can paint it's it's low-tech actually you can paint one side of the asteroid affect its albedo so that the sun's rays push differentially on one side rather than the other that will shift its orbit slightly it has to be calculated you can give it a little knock with with with a rocket basically you don't want to blow it up you don't want to turn you know you're one big piece of our artillery shell into buckshot you don't want to do that you want to you want to move it into a safer orbit you can mount jets on it people are looking now to mining asteroids of course our society always goes our civilization always goes for the where weather where the money's to be made but yeah if we can mine asteroids we can move asteroids and and the technology is there and ironically the most dangerous asteroids are going to be the ones that are the closest to the earth which are the most accessible and the asteroids pretty much have unbelievable amounts of resources on them I mean pretty much everything that is being mined on the earth can be found in asteroids from the hydrocarbons to precious metals to all of these things and we're not that far away from technologically being able to actually you know mount expeditions to asteroids and mined them and that's that's the the you know that's the solution I kind of prefer because again these things are tremendous sources of reefs of all kinds of things that would be usable to an expanding civilization and we could feasibly within a decade or two be mining asteroids and again the ones that are the easiest to access are also going to be the ones that are more dangerous because they're the ones that are coming the closest to the earth so and another point here is that there is one specific danger there's one specific if you like region of the sky that really needs to be looked at and this is this is the region of the sky this is why I wrote magicians of the gods because because of this discovery that there's a thing called the torrid meteor stream which is 30 million kilometres wide and which envelops the solar system and the earth on its orbit around the Sun passes through the torrid meteor stream twice a year turns out the torrid meteor stream is the debris of a giant comet that came in to the inner solar system about 20,000 years ago that thing was at least a hundred kilometers in diameter according to their calculations it may have been more so and then like other comets like shoemaker-levy 9 which spectacularly hit Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up into multiple fragments and those carry on orbiting on the original path which and as they break up more and more they degrade and small bits and large bits break off and it gradually fills up a kind of huge hoop of debris that the earth is passing through twice a year it takes us 12 days to pass through it we do two and a half million kilometres a day on our orbital path 12 days to get through the torrid meteor stream and the scientists of the comet research group have made the point that a big object out of the torrid meteor stream multiple objects as a matter of fact was what hit the North American ice cap twelve thousand eight hundred years ago it looks like there was a second series of impacts eleven thousand six hundred years ago from the same source it looks like there were other impacts in the Bronze Age the most recent almost definite impact out of the torrid meteor stream was Tunguska in Siberia back in 1908 that hit on the 30th of June 1908 and that's at the peak of the torrid June shower when we passed through the tories in June and and in November and what they're saying is we really need to focus on this torrid meteor stream their calculations are that there are hundreds and hundreds of massive objects in that torrid meteor stream and you know as a comet breaks up into bits it becomes those bits become asteroids and those asteroids are circling in the torrid media stream and I've likened it to strapping on a a blindfold and crossing an eight-lane interstate twice a year and just hoping that we don't hit any heavy traffic you know that we meet bicycles or motorcycles rather than rather than trucks but the trucks are out there and what the comet research group scientists are saying is we need now to be in depth investigating the torrid meteor stream because it appears to be the hidden hand in human civilization it has wiped out episodes of our history in the past and there's no reason to expect that it won't do so again unless we do something about it because the remnants of that original giant comet still circling in the torrid media stream and they are fucking dangerous now how is this being received in mainstream science I mean is there any resistance to this because it seems like this is all pretty straightforward and entrer scible mostly being ignored mostly being ignored why I think that is by scientists who have a vested interest in other ideas first of all there's a vested interest in not admitting that cataclysms are important at all this goes right back to really to the 19th century when science began to take shape in the form that we know it now and they wanted to separate themselves off understandably from superstition so I didn't want anything to do with something that sounds like the Biblical Flood for example they felt they would be contaminated by that and they preferred to explain any cataclysmic evidence as a result of gradual processes so you really think it's because of the reluctance to accept religion or religious ideas or to to separate themselves I think that was the stuff where it started or it started to separate themselves off from that now they've gone a long way from that and many many scientists have got a vested interest in what is called uniformitarianism or gradualism and they they don't like to hear about cataclysms having any major impact on the story of life on earth so is it sort of the momentum of these initial desires to escape religious influence that have sort of led them down this path yes and then there are others who have a vested interest in current accounts of global warming there's others who have a vested interest in extinctions taking place now they want to say that our ancestors were responsible for the extinction of all the mammoths and mastodons and so on and so forth whereas the comet research group scientists are saying no those huge megafauna of North America were wiped out as a result of the massive series of impacts on the North American ice cap I'm reading a book right now by Dan Flores a really interesting book called coyote America he's a wildlife historian and he is really an expert on all the different forms of Wildlife in North America where they originated were they migrated to and one of the more fascinating things about it is he's talking about all these animals that went extinct you know ten thousand plus years ago this mass extinction event and never once does he bring up cataclysms and and there's all these different these different ideas and one of the big being that human beings with addle addle x' which is like really a very weird sort of a spear throwing device wiped out the woolly mammoths and all these other animals and to me a posture it's a lunatic idea also if you have any contact with hunter-gatherers today you find that hunter-gatherer peoples don't over kill their game they they hunt them respectfully they take what they need and they leave the rest because it's a renewable resource for them so I don't think hunter-gatherers wiped out the the mammoths in North America the evidence is compelling it was the comedy well the evidence that you brought up when you were here the first time when you showed the images of all those mammoths that had been literally knocked over with broken legs from the impact of something on a mass burial grounds like these mass did you know and not burial grounds obviously but mass casualties mortality sights mortality sites cool yeah that's a good way of putting it yeah in fact graham i visited one up in south dakota called hot springs where there's just several dozen nobody knows how many are actually there but there's at least several dozen two species woolly mammoths and Colombian mammoths that have been entombed and while we were there I interestingly I you know the the guide the woman giving us the tour there was kind of giving the a gradualist explanation at well over long periods of time these mammoths wandered into a sinkhole and were too dumb to get out and so they became entombed and I asked the question well what studies have been done on the the sedimentary matrix in which their remains are being found because as I'm looking at this sedimentary matrix I'm seeing a massive deposit that in other words a deposit that was instantaneous instantaneous and when I brought that up she actually got very irritated and wailing you all yet dismissed my question didn't you know what we've got it all worked out you know we we know about that well what is it well you just we've got it all worked out and it immediately went on with her like but yet I had an article that was actually written by one of the original scientists worked on the site and he his description was well it could have been that but also as an alternative and he used the term bloat and flow that what you had was woolly mammoths that had been caught in a flood drowned and they're bloated carcasses floated into a depression in the landscape and that's where they were entombed and that makes a whole lot more sense to me than the fact that you know individually over several thousand years these in these mammoths wandered into this sinkhole and then couldn't get out but you got to bear in mind we're talking about you know at the end of the last ice age a hundred and twenty roughly species of megafauna that disappeared which is about equivalent to the same number of megafauna species that inhabits the earth today well as a short period of time was something like 65 percent of the North American mammals went extinct 75 / 75 percent a very short period of time or a very short period of time pretty much totally coincident with that period called the Younger Dryas and so there's nothing resembling what we're capable of doing today back then I mean when you look at human extinction events human caused extinction events was very logical and what we're doing today with pollution and the expanse of civilization and weapons are super sophisticated if we wanted to we could wipe out a lot of different species yeah but what we're out of the least the case actually seeing is that at the end of what's called the balling allarod which was the gradual warming at the end of the last ice age that preceded the sudden catastrophic change at 12,800 was a de Clovis culture that existed for three to five hundred years I think yes somewhere but they suddenly were gone right exactly simultaneous with the mammoths and then there are interesting studies that coming out now showing that at least continental wide there was apparently a major human population crash exactly coincident with the megafauna extinctions because you had quarries that had been mined for centuries that are suddenly abandoned you have campsites that had been that had generations of debris and toolkits accumulating and so on debris from the from the the fluting of the the spear points and so on that are suddenly abandoned right so the evidence actually suggests that the human population crashed which would certainly imply that they would been far less capable of wiping out all of these species of MegaFon also the the studies of their diet and their life ways suggest that they were very quite diverse they were hunter-gatherers and they focus mostly on small game they ate a lot of fish lot of shellfish they gathered food and why would they go after the biggest most dangerous animal you know in the in the whole in the whole array of animals and with the incredible efficiency hunt them to extinction in a hundred years it doesn't make sense no it makes no sense it seems pretty silly it mean ancestors from that time if I may say Randall mentioned the Clovis culture this is for a very long time really until just a couple of years ago all of the mainstream academics in the fields of archeology and anthropology were saying there were no human beings in North America before let's say 13,000 years ago give or take five hundred years and they came across the Bering Land Bridge the Bering Strait at that time was above water sea level was lower they entered the Americas then they weren't hit there before now in the last two to three years there's just been a whole raft of new scientific research and no scientist today is prepared to defend the Clovis model anymore it's accepted of course that they've been human beings in America for 50,000 60,000 years and there's weird genetic links like for example there's a trace that connects Aboriginal Australians with North Americans they had a common ancestor it's a very peculiar thing that's going on and so what what happens is that actually these scientific models which constrain and restrict research for so long do get overthrown and that Clovis model is being overthrown and what the missing piece of the puzzle puzzle I think for everybody working this field is the Cataclysm the comet what happened between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago which changed everything is it the bizarre to you guys or frustrating in any way that this is not a mainstream idea this is this very much fringe but yet it's it's not something that we don't have any evidence whenever whenever I put out a book I'm I immediately there's this huge hostile reaction like the Michael Shermer thing like the Michael Shermer thing like me I mean I would say magicians of the gods which I published in 2015 which deals with this whole comet issue is actually the most thoroughly documented the most thoroughly referenced book that I've ever written it's calm its measured they actually don't read it they just say Oh Hancock's brought out another book he's a pseudo-scientists that's what they always call me or a pseudo archaeologist and and it's obviously rubbish because it disagrees with everything that we know well that's the point of the heretic in society is to offer an alternative view and and well-documented evidence but it seems that we're dealing with such a deeply ingrained mindset which is connected in curious ways to power structures in our society that it's very difficult to change it absolutely like graham mentioned earlier there's kind of a poet it went from a religious motive I think in the 19th century and now it's more a political motive and again the idea that every day you'll find something you know coming from various factions that were destroying the earth and the earth has never suffered this kind of you know assault on it before and and you know we're causing the sixth great mass extinction and we're going to cause catastrophic global warming if we pump another 50 or 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and and so what that is done is like many I won't say many but several of the scientists now that have been in the forefront of criticising the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis are also very much involved in the global warming movement and the idea that we are now precipitating the sixth great mass extinction having looked now at mass extinctions and been really an obsession of mine for about thirty years now I've looked at everything from the cretaceous-tertiary the Permian Triassic you know right on down the line to the most recent one which to me is really in some ways the most interesting because the most recent mass extinction that we're talking about is the one that took place while we humans were were part of the of the story and between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago the Younger Dryas yes the Younger Dryas which is still an unexplained climate anomaly that happened and I mentioned this I think in previous broadcast that you know what you had was you had just spasm of extreme warming followed by rapid shifting into extreme cold literally within a matter of a few years and we're talking about climate changes that are up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit within perhaps 1 to 5 years which uh turley Dwarfs anything that we've experienced in the last since the industrial revolution began and we still don't really understand and that's why this research is so important because now we understand that there was something cosmic that happened it's left its imprint in the landscape over what four continents five continents yeah over over 50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface there's a giant debris field of the this stuff that is only produced by massive impacts these things come in at 70,000 miles an hour and you know if they have any diameter at all if they're if they're 100 meters or more in diameter they are they are going to hit the earth really hard they're not going to burn up in the atmosphere and when they do they pack a huge amount of kinetic energy a huge amount of heat and shock and that creates very definite chemical products so nano diamonds so Carbon spherules so melt glass that's like the Trinitite that was produced in nuclear explosions all of these when they're all found together in the same layer of soil and when you can put a date on that layer of soil and when it's all over the world there's only one thing can explain them a massive cosmic it I don't understand why this is controversial I really don't I mean I do I understand it because I know that once people start teaching things once people start doing lectures and giving speeches they want to stick to their guns and they want to they want to somehow or another avoid anything that's going to contradict what what they've been espousing it's a game this is a game changer this information it changes everything it changes the way we've looked at our past it changes the whole story of archaeology and it changes the way we're going to look at the future and I think that people in academia are reluctant to embrace that change and they're afraid of being called pseudo scientists because there's a whole lobby of skeptics who use this word pseudo scientist or pseudo archeologist as an instant dismissal of other ideas and those who are in the profession they don't want to get tarred with that brush they want to keep themselves clean and I understand that but you're talking about hard evidence yeah you're talking about this nuclear glass you're talking about nano diamonds you're talking about core samples that show this massive shift when you do the ice core samples massive shift in temperature and you're talking about very clear evidence of impacts that we know exist it's not like a comet's a theory that's not like it's Bigfoot or something like you know we're looking for the final piece of evidence it shows that comas real thing exactly it's real it's Toth it's totally real but it's so difficult for those who are invested in other models to accept and unfortunately they have the ear of the media it's the it's there are or by the way all the scientists in the comic comet research group are absolutely mainstream scientists and they have taken a lot of flack from their colleagues for even daring to investigate this area that's why they've had no funding they've had to fund themselves it's so well that is so crazy because this is not a controversial thing in my mind shouldn't be it should not be this is not an airy-fairy thing we're not talking about psychics we're not talking about UFOs we're talking about something we know exists yeah so to bury your head in the sand over something like this seems to me invested in a process is interest right now NASA is spending the equivalent of one attack helicopter a year on investigating the the Comet and asteroid danger you know 50 million dollars a year that's not that much it's peanuts it's a tiny it's a miniscule some hundreds of billions of dollars on on massive sophisticated military equipment which we can use to slaughter one another in ever more sophisticated ways but just fifty million dollars a year on saving the earth from from a potential Cataclysm that could put our civilization back into the Stone Age tomorrow and I don't mean to keep harping on Michael Shermer because I like microwave but that he highlights this sort of natural inclination to poke fun at something that he has done no research on whatsoever when I pointed out gobekli tepe and I sent him some articles from National Geographic he went radio silent mm-hmm I mean he should know about it it's astonishing the people mocking it yeah he's gonna mock it you should actually know what you're mocking and to say that Gobekli Tepe was created by hunter-gatherers what I'm sorry that's just theory that's not it that's not a fact you seem very very sophisticated site with astronomical alignments with hundreds and hundreds of megalithic pillars weighing up to 20 tons each the world's first perfectly aligned north-south building which you can only do with astronomy this is it's not enough to say oh they were just hunter-gatherers there was something strong from a half a mile away I mean there's there's some serious sophistication I mean what how big were these stones well the the biggest one actually still in the quarry they left it because it had a fault in it they clearly intended to move it 50 tons you're looking at 20 foot high objects and then it's the it's the putting together of them see here's the problem hunter-gatherer societies are not the kinds of societies that produce large-scale fixed monuments why because they don't generate a surplus you can't pay for somebody to become an architect and for it of those times somebody become an astronomer you're busy hunting and gathering and that's what you do agriculture generates a surplus and that's the bat is the problem at gobekli tepe because there is no background this site just appears out of nowhere amidst what appears to be a hunter gatherer community but what they're not considering is the possibility we're looking at a technology transfer that the survivors of a lost civilization who already had all that knowledge came to go back Lee Tepe and use that site as a center of initiation to teach the local hunter-gatherers how to do agriculture and that's now taken as the beginnings of civilization I would say it is the reinvention or the remaking of civilization so when we're looking back at Sumer and any artifacts we find ancient Mesopotamia in that area Iraq those are the people that are sort of reinventing and relearning well that's hence Oliver actually when we talk of Mesopotamia which means between two rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates gobekli tepe is sitting right there in the headwaters between the Tigris and the Euphrates and we cannot separate that from the later cultures that enter history five thousand six thousand years ago they're part of the lineage that descended from gobekli tepe times and what's fascinating about gobekli tepe is the way it doesn't fit the way there is no background to it that you would expect to see them practicing learning architectural skills the oldest stuff should be the worst and as they carry on it gets better that site ran for a thousand years the best stuff is the oldest a thousand years later what they were producing wasn't so good this is a real anomaly and it needs to be investigated not mocked by skeptics but actually explored to consider maybe this does Rock the whole paradigm and it's kind of ironic that in their desire to get away from the ancient myths and tales in the Bible they've ignored those ancient myths and tales which all talk about cataclysms well part of our modern psychology is to imagine that we are somehow so far advanced from our predecessors that we now represent the pinnacle of civilization and anything that preceded us has to be looked upon almost as you know as if the workings of children it requires a major psychological shift to admit or accept that our ancestors have may have been far far more sophisticated than than we had imagined in our 19th century models which basically still dominate thinking today and you know in Graham's book he devotes several chapters to the story of one 19th 20th century heretic J Harlen Bretz in his story to me kind of encapsulates the whole the whole process of forcing his paradigm shift and for years he was out there exploring this evidence that there had been this tremendous flooding in Washington State and all of his critics were dismissive without ever even going out and looking at the evidence firsthand in the field but what he did was he stuck to his guns for three decades and continued to amass evidence to the point where they just couldn't they couldn't dismiss it anymore and finally a group of them went out and began to explore the the landscapes for themselves and one of the leaders I think you talked about it in your book James Gillooly who was sort of the leader of the the skeptic faction that had set out their sole purpose was to discredit and lay this whole flood heresy to rest once and for all but he went out in the field and they spent about eight days in the field where he's seeing this evidence for himself over and over again and when you look at just one piece of it you might be able to say okay there's other explanations for that but what happens is when you get multiple lines of evidence all converging and there's no way to individually explain away each one of those things other than just saying oh well it's all coincidence what he this James Gillooly was honest enough so that after a week out there they were in a place called Palouse Falls in southern Washington which was one of these areas where these tremendous inland tsunami swept across the land and I actually just visited there about eight weeks ago when I took a group of people out there and and took them to Palouse Falls to show them right on the spot where James Gillooly was standing when he finally had his epiphany divyam images that that you brought with us I have images I can dig them up here yeah I sure do yeah I've got some really interesting images to show you which relates because see this flooding stuff relates directly to the idea of the impact and we can get into a little bit of that explaining how how these parallel lines of evidence are now converging but the interesting thing about but Gillooly was that in the India descriptions of the trip he wandered off by himself for a long time away from the group and was standing here looking at this massive cataract with 400 foot cliffs in this little tiny ribbon of water flowing over it in this huge canyon below it and these big boulders and he had seen for a whole week he'd been seeing this stuff and it finally got to the point where it wasn't undeniable and he walked back to the group and the words out of his mouth verbatim were how could I have been so wrong and he finally admitted and at that that was like a turning point and now and again Graham describes it's very effectively in the book how in a way the flooding phenomena was hijacked and then placed within this more gradual istic context to really to avoid the fact that it was something so anomalous in so such a departure from our modern experience that we had to look outside of our modern experience to find an explanation what they wanted to do was find something within our modern experience and this is the the cornerstone of the uniformitarian approach is that we look for a modern example and then we extrapolate backwards from that and so what they did was they saw well in the modern term in the modern world we have Pro glacial lakes lake that's that form in front of glaciers and sometimes these Progreso Lakes might be held in by a ice dam or another glacier these ice dams will give away and they will cause pretty catastrophic flooding they're very common up in Iceland because you've got several volcanoes under the law the Icelandic ice sheets and up there they use the term yokel ops to describe these outburst floods but here's the thing when you look at the modern versions of it you basically are looking at floods that are less than one thousandth of one single flow from these floods we're talking about that happened you know twelve and thirteen thousand years ago one thousand less than a thousand less than a thousandth in peak discharge and in total volume and and so it has been admitted in several places I've extracted the quote saying well we do admit that this is a major extrapolation upwards but never mind yeah you know was it never mind is so disturbing me see Holland breaths for 30 years was walking the walk in the channeled scablands and what he saw was evidence for as he called it a humungous flood which which actually Rosenthal within fell within three weeks and and he went through decades of being put aside by his colleagues insulted they mocked him they laughed at him just as the sceptics do today but gradually the evidence began to mount and they couldn't deny it any more that there had been there had been flooding and actually eventually they gave Harlen Bretz Joe Holland Brett's the Penrose medal which is the ultimate you know the ultimate be stole of geology in America he got the accolade and he said at that he was aboard more than 90 years old at that time and he said at that time he said all my enemies are dead so I have no one left to gloat over but but the point is in a way there was nothing to gloat about because what they did was they they they separated him from his central idea instead of accepting that there had been one huge flood and that was always his view they said oh there must have been 70 or 80 floods that caused all this damage and that's what we're that's what we are seriously challenging right now it's so ironic in a way that the human desire for knowledge is what has led us to where we are today we have this insatiable desire for knowledge and for innovation but that same human desire to achieve is also what what's the the ego is responsible for that and the ego blocks anything that's contrary to what you've already established as fact exactly as soon as you see something that might throw a monkey wrench into the gears of what you've been teaching and practicing your whole life and I know that you've gone through this with Egypt your your whole issue with the Sphinx and with dr. Schaack and John Anthony West was on the podcast I was with you just recently yeah he's amazing by the way I'm going to be doing an event in New York with John Anthony West when on the 29th of November where it's well it's in it again it's linked on my website the details are on the talks and events pages in its in some church somewhere but I'm going to give a presentation and then I'm going to interview John live on live on stage first time I've ever done that I'm kind of podcasting you know in such a character he's an amazing I love that dude and in magical Egypt is I think one of most important things anybody could ever watch I think that DVD series is just insane it's so spectacular and so fantastic and next to going to Egypt with that which I haven't done I think that's probably the second best thing just bet you back and John is an example of why we need heretics this is this is the thing you see that the science today yes you're right we have this thirst for knowledge and its case human characteristic but also we get invested in particular positions that when people criticize those positions we take it as an existential threat and where we beget all angry and hot and bothered about it if we allow that to happen too much we don't keep a place for heretics in our society then we're never going to do anything novel we're gradually going to get locked down ossified into the into the existing system we need heretics John has been the leading heretic on ancient Egypt for decades pointing out that we should listen to what the ancient Egyptians said that their civilization was not a divot it was a legacy it was a legacy from the time of the gods and that cast me back again to this whole issue of a lost civilization now when gobekli tepe was discovered it vindicated you in so many ways but what are the possibilities if any of more of these sites being explored and exposed Amu's are there are there more that people are looking at right now are there any that are under the radar just a year ago at the bottom of the Sicily channel at a depth of more than a hundred and twenty feet it's been underwater for at least 9,000 years is a huge megalithic site before the discovery of Gobekli Tepe that site could never have been explained the dating is absolutely definite the Seas rose and covered it at least 9,000 years ago we don't know how long it stood there before it was covered by the rising seas but there it sits underwater and I think underwater discoveries are and I've had a part to play in this over the years are one of the ways forward we need to look at those areas because there was a 400 foot rise in sea level at the end of the Ice Age you're looking at the amount of land that would be put together in say Europe and China added together that amount of land was swallowed by those rising seas and archaeology has largely proceeded without taking account of those lost lands I'm not saying they haven't looked at all but they're primarily in marine archaeology interested in shipwrecks now this this megalithic site is there images of this so we could look at there are yeah yeah yeah I can I can probably find it monolith at the bottom of the Sicily channel try that try that a search on that pull that up Jamie yeah but so what does this look like is this and is this been clearly established that this actually is the work of man this is not some sort of a yardang or something of course there's dispute right of course but the mainstream is not going to just accept this overnight but again it's mainstream scientists have found it they're absolutely certain that they're dealing with a man-made site there are holes drilled through these megaliths one of them is very very large there's a series of other megaliths around about it's not a natural thing so here we're looking at some of it right yeah so there's that big big megalith broken into two parts right there oh wow yeah and and and this we can say a often with archaeological sites the problem is dating them you know for example there are incredible megalithic temples all over the island of Malta not far away from this place incredible megalithic temples but they can't date the stone directly they have to date organic material associated with the stone and that can give them misleadingly young dates in a case of a site that's been covered by sea level rise there can be no argument nobody went down there and built that 9,000 years ago it had to be built before the Seas rose and that puts a minimum age on it of 9,000 years what are the best images that we can look at because right now I'm just seeing rocks it's very difficult because I'm looking at so that's I mentioned I'm afraid that's all you're going to see those are those are the best images of it that existed over 1 right above that that's in Yonaguni okay that's not in that's not in the Sicily channel so um what what are the biggest pieces down there is it this right here is this way yeah that big thing big thing there I'm 30 feet long I think and is it what what leads you to believe that this is man-made the scientists who worked on it the fact that there are holes drilled through the stone the fact that you can go to neighbouring areas like Armenia and find really very ancient megalithic sites where they have exactly the same kind of holes drilled through the stones and the holes seem to have been used for astronomical sightings now this sites a mess it's been knocked over by the sea it's fallen down but we're seeing the same thing big megaliths with holes drilled through them and you're also dealing with 9,000 plus years of erosion and barnacle arose all of it all of that and the ocean is a difficult place to work you know yeah it's it's it's not easy visibility can be bad you're dealing with currents there's all kinds of all kinds of problems this is Britain just cups Cameron this crazy little submarine ring in James Cameron well I spent seven years scuba diving or around the world looking at this stuff and you know it's pretty convincing in my view well it is it does make sense that if we do know for a fact and we do that the sea level rose dramatically at the end of the Ice Age it makes sense that some things would be buried under the water well in during the Ice Age whatever you know you don't have to talk about advanced civilizations or anything but the during the Ice Age living on the coastlines in establishing your as communities everything on the coastlines would have been probably one of the most benign places to get you know because for one thing you're down near see the sea level this presence of the Seas is going to you know smooth out the climate and so forth so you know you're going to have probably most cultural development during the Ice Age is going to be close to this to the sea so it's going to be underwater now just like Graham was talking about and so this to me is probably the future of archaeology as marine archaeology where a lot of discoveries are going to be made and in that particular thing I mean there's a lot of megalithic structures around the world that if you set that thing up like this and put those citing holes through it would look precisely like scrape the barnacles off of it you know and no one's saying oh it's proven but what it is is we have to keep an open mind and say well there are some very strong similarities here so let's investigate this thing further and that's the whole point of all this is all of this stuff needs more research it doesn't need some Cavalier dismissal by somebody who's you know protecting their their own paradigm it needs more research on all fronts I mean because I think that there's enough evidence it is now accumulated to suggest that there is a deep history to the human species on earth and we're just beginning to really appreciate how much deeper really is than the conventional models of history and rather than just waving an arm and dismissing this with a skeptical snare with a skeptical sneer exactly oh it's interesting is there's accepted scientific models of humanity when you're talking about supervolcano's right like the super volcano of 60 70 thousand years ago towba yeah I mean they're they pretty much accept that wiped out of the vast majority of human beings on earth mm-hmm and why is the supervolcano hypothesis so easily accepted but yet the asteroid impact both of them are real events both of them are historically documented in fact we really don't we've never watched a supervolcano take over the world but we've seen asteroids hit other planets we've actually watched shoemaker-levy like you were talking about before we call embodying Jupiter unbel lievable bigger impact and the planet Earth itself yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly so yeah and actually more than 20 impacts each each each one of them would have wiped out all life on Earth if that if that object had hit the earth yeah so you know so it's a it's a it's very another thing too we were talking about underwater structures but let's also consider the possibility and again john anthony west work is important here let's also consider the possibility that we have misidentified a number of structures that are standing in plain view like the great sphinx Egyptology read any egypt logical text any encyclopedia actually they will tell you that thing was put there by a specific Pharaoh Pharaoh Khafre of the fourth dynasty round about 2500 BC that is not a fact that is an opinion but it's presented as a fact there is not a single inscription that relates the Sphinx to that fair or not a contemporary experience Krypton not one dating from 2500 BC in fact there's nothing at all it's just the assumption because it's close to a pyramid which they assume the same pharaoh built again on the absence of evidence that the sphinx must have been built by them but john anthony worse was the first to see that actually when we look at the sphinx we're looking at a highly eroded stone object and that erosion is very odd and that's why he brought professor Robert Schoch professor of geology from Boston University to Giza in 1992 to look at the Sphinx and say what actually caused this weathering on the Sphinx and shock immediately saw it what caused it was exposure to a very long period of heavy heavy heavy rainfall and no such rains have fallen in Egypt in the last five thousand years but they did fall during the Younger Dryas we had a prolonged rain out from this comet impact as that ice cap was pulverized and a massive amount of ice water was thrown up into the upper atmosphere prolonged rain ow which could have been the cause of the erosion on the Sphinx now what has occurred new what discoveries have been discovered in the last year like what what is new that we can look at there in terms of archaeology there's not much new gobekli tepe at the moment is in deep freeze it's right 30 miles from the Syrian border there's been massive an unrest and unrest in Chandelure which is that the main town archeology is very difficult for them to to carry on there it's basically just frozen where it just sort of stopped they've just kind of stopped you know and in fact there's amazing number of these of these sites another site I visited from magicians of the girls was bar back in the Lebanon absolutely stunning site and again I'm convinced that that site is nuanced it is yes there is a Roman temple there but they put that temple there because the site was sacred long before and there's this incredible u-shaped megalithic wall which surrounds Baalbek which does not appear to have any connection to the to the Roman structure at all again that's an area which is subject to tremendous unrest and difficulty and it's difficult for archaeologists to proceed but just just in 2014 they they made a huge new discovery at Baalbek of a buried block which weighs one thousand four hundred and sixty tons which was sitting there on the site that they'd been working that site for a hundred years they only found it in 2014 Wow 1000 tonnes 1462 is that two million pounds so that is like I don't know it may be what math is better than mine and converting it into pole one times 2,000 pounds yeah 2,000 pounds to her to a turn to an imperial ton so whatever and I had three zeros on it double it and had 3 zeros on it it's a horrendous amount of pounds to put that way this it's a single largest block of stone ever cut and quarried in the ancient world and they found this just in 2014 found it in 2014 now there's another big one right beside it which has been in plain view for about the last hundred years and it's astonishing to me that this one which is just below it was covered by sediment that we have a national calculator you might be the only person unless I never go anywhere without my calculator uh-huh nobody has one of those we were just talking about that yesterday you're like who the fuck assistant is an actual car I'm the last guy take care of you when it while the so Baalbek was also the site of I mean there's many mountain monoliths that have been discovered there and it's really fascinating site that most any people have sort of overlooked when you talk about ancient structures absolutely I have to resist I I've got nothing against aliens but I don't need aliens to explain these things I I think a much a much leaner and more elegant explanation for these huge archaeological anomalies is a lost human civilization much better it has been the case that I've been making for 25 years I think the the alien thing is a bit of a distraction but of course there's aliens of course the universe is full of life but the ancient archaeological sites are not good evidence for that idea that they're very unless you massage the evidence a lot they're not good evidence I think we are dealing with a lost human civilization and at Baalbek 20 feet above the ground we have three blocks of stone join so closely together that you can't get it edge of a sheet of paper between them each one weighs more than 900 tons and they are 20 feet above the ground it's a stun it's a stunning achievement it's just absolutely astonishing how on earth did they do and how does mainstream archaeology deal with that they say are the Romans built it all are the Romans yeah the Romans did it the Romans did do some awesome stuff they did do some awesome stuff they absolutely did but this site is separate from the Roman site it surrounds it but it's not part of it in my view in terms of your question what's happened within the last year or two I would think that probably the most significant thing or certainly right up there would be the the comet research and the discovery I mean like this article I have right here which came out in 2014 so it's not that old a nano diamond-rich layer across three continents consistent with major cosmic impact at twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and it's something like 2425 highly pedigreed scientists and these are the comet research group gives scientists from the comet research group who have funded all their research themselves they came out with another paper in 2050 where was this published if anybody wants to read this that's in the Journal of geology yeah but then there's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences hosts a lot of their work as well and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences get into trouble for hosting their work but they feel it's important so they keep on hosting it this is so spectacularly confusing to me because that's rocks science yeah this is evidence it actually can weigh this stuff you can measure it you can you could run tests on it and find out what its components are this to me is so baffling yeah it's very baffling they had brought out another paper in 2015 I won't go into the some of the details are boring but it's called a Basie and chronological analysis and basically what they're what they were looking at is it they asked themselves is it possible that this evidence these nano diamonds these melt glass the Carbon spherules could that have been laid down gradually and the chronological analysis that they've done absolutely answers that no it was not laid down gradually this whole thing unfolded in a period of about 24 hours whoa what a night yeah in what had happened Joe was that for years archaeologists had recognized this up Ede black matte layer at about two dozen or more of the Clovis sites around North America which there had been over 50 of them that have been studied and it was C Vance Haines who wrote an interesting paper saying that he was the one who noted that below this black matte layer which is only two to three inches thick in most sites you found evidence of the Clovis culture you found their toolkits and their their spear points and so on you found evidence of the extinct megafauna but not above it you would find this evidence of this cultural activity and the megafauna right up to the bottom of the of the black mat layer but not above it so what finally happened was in 2007 Richard Firestone and Alan West and some of their colleagues and it was just basically a small group at that point took a look at this closer look and that's when they began to discover these impact proxies usually right at the base of the layer and the layer itself is carbonaceous which suggests that there had been a lot of soot deposited which would imply widespread wildfires factors to study off the red off the coast of California on the Santa Rosa Islands that pretty much concluded that there was just massive wildfires that pretty much just annihilated everything and then this was preceded by the deposition of this black matte layer and right at the bottom of this black matte layer is where you'll find the nano diamonds the magnetic grains the microspheres the carbonaceous Ferrell's fullerenes you find these impact proxies and they're not all the same at all the sites in fact that's been one of the things that the critics have seized upon but what they're doing is I think taking an oversimplified model and when you look at a comet fragmentation event you could be looking at the individual pieces could be have very different compositions and what we were talking about earlier the torrid meteor stream I'm not convinced at this point it was necessarily just a single impact event it may have been a bombardment episode that may have lasted even several decades it may have then ceased for a while and we were talking about this last night over dinner that there seems to be a second spasm at eleven thousand six hundred years ago that's also associated with a massive rise in sea level they call there's two meltwater spikes meltwater spike one a in meltwater spike one B I'm quite convinced that these meltwater spikes that have been documented by marine geologist and oceanographers are correlated with these melting events of the ice sheet that I've been looking at in terms of their their geomorphic consequences because some of these events I mean the only way I can describe some of these meltwater events is that you the only modern analog to this would be a tsunami and we've seen some pretty devastating tsunamis within the last decade or two both in Indonesia and in Japan and I don't know if you've ever seen any of like the videos of these tsunamis anybody listening it is definitely worthwhile to go online and look at some of these videos where you can actually see the the unbelievably powerful effects of a 30 or 40 or 50 foot tsunami right now some of the landscapes and I have a some images we can pull up here shortly are places in Montana Idaho Washington where you literally had a tsunami sweeping over the land there was over a thousand feet deep and that tsunami came off the I'm not an oceanic tsunami that's like it's a freshwater tsunami it's meltwater coming off this this catastrophic melting of the ice sheet and I've traced the sources of some of these meltwater I've made two trips now up into the into the plateau country of British Columbia looking for the source of this meltwater because in the conventional models now of this this flooding this that goes back to Harland breaths and basically what they've done is they said initially there could have been no flood because Harlen Bretz didn't provide a source for the water they said the critic said well you're saying that all of this evidence in the landscape is evidence of the flood but what was the source of the flood and he didn't have a source so the critics then said well you don't have a source for the flood water therefore the flood didn't take place then as as the research evolved you had independent evidence accumulating in western Montana by JT Pardee who was with the US Geological Survey and he was investigating evidence that the mountain valleys of western Montana had been filled up with an enormous volume of water and this volume of water seemed to be exactly the same time as brett's as floods he then assumed that this was a giant lake and because you can see and we can I think we have some images I think Jamie has some images so we'll pull him up shortly we're on the mountain side you see the shorelines itched you know a thousand feet above the valley floor and what he then decided was that based upon an old nineteenth-century interpretation by TC Chamberland that there had been an ice dam he said well there must have been an ice dam west of here somewhere in the Clark Fork Valley a giant lake backed up burst through the ice dam and then this is what would have caused Harlen Bretz 'as floods so now the geological community is shifting because number one the evidence is overwhelming and they can't deny it anymore but what they're doing is looking for a gradualist or a more uniformitarian explanation so they immediately latched on to this well there's a giant Pro glacial or in front of a glacial lake in western Montana well you're talking about somewhere between five hundred and twenty and five hundred and fifty cubic miles of water that's a lot of water right in in and normally when you have a large lake you have a huge catchment base and it is feeding lots of streams and rivers that are feeding into that lake when you look at the any of the big lakes around North America you have the lake and then you have this big old catchment basin and all of that's feeding in Lake Missoula the whole lake fills almost the whole catchment basin it's like to me what they did was they said okay we're just going to push the source of the water from here over to here but let's not go into the question of where did the water come from that's filling these mountain valleys of western Montana and this is what I spent a couple of weeks in September going up into some of these following these valleys up into British Columbia and there's spectacular evidence and it's almost like the American geologist stopped at the 49th parallel and they say well that's the Canadians preserve up there we'll let them they've got their own theories we've got ours interestingly the Canadians are saying that we think that the water for these floods came from up here but they don't like that because you see one of the leading geologists who was saying that these floods came from from Canada is John Shaw who who basically came up there was idea that drumlins which are these inverted boat hull shaped landforms that are found by hundreds of thousands in regions where where glaciers were that they were formed not by the glaciers grinding over the landscape but they were actually formed by massive sub glacial flows of water and his critics have all been saying well here's the problem what's the source of your water therefore it wasn't water wasn't sub glacial floods is easy parallels the Harlen Bretz a story very closely well here's the thing Shaw and his colleagues couldn't really come up with a plausible explanation for how you could form these massive sub glacial reservoirs in fact what they call the Livingstone Lake event required eighty four thousand cubic kilometers of water and I eighty-four thousand kilometers I can do it really quickly here we divide that by 36 that's about 2300 cubic miles of water that's more than all of the great lakes combined vastly bigger than all of the Great Lakes combined it's probably every Lake in North America combined and he said this one event required over two thousand cubic miles of water well where did that water come from so he basically said well there must have been a reservoir somehow that formed his critics have said that's impossible you couldn't form that much water under the ice sheet well what's happened now is the idea of a major cosmic impact into the ice sheet has completely obviated the need for a sub glacial reservoir because now we have a way of instantaneously melting enormous volumes of ice it's no longer a mystery when the water came from fully explained and this has been the missing piece of the puzzle until the comet research group began to identify this evidence well it's baffling to me that this is a source of controversy because we know that the Great Lakes were created by melting glaciers we also know that there's vast areas of North America that are flattened by these glaciers you know a buddy mine my friend Doug lives in Cazenovia Wisconsin which is what's called the Driftless area where the glaciers didn't go through I just was there in May it's peuta a it's beautiful it's gorgeous give rolling hills and it's just it wasn't it wasn't crushed flat like other parts of North America were right so we know we know that those glaciers melted and they created the Great Lakes I mean the Great Lakes were from glaciers we know that that's an established fact so why is all this confusing I just don't understand why they wouldn't just add that to it they just can accept the great glaciers somehow or another in the last 10,000 years the glaciers just decided to stop smashing North America flat and melt and create these great inland oceans of fresh water yeah yeah those are it's it's very bizarre ultimately a lot of ideology is is involved in this there's there's that there's this desire also in the modern world there's a desire not to panic the public not to say things that are that are going to cause that are going to cause panic you now with Donald Trump being president I think people ready now I think people are ready for panic I think so has anybody debated you on this either one of you on this well you know I tried to Dan but not specifically on this I tried to do a debate with Zahi Hawass who was the guy who runs the Giza pyramids and the madman yeah yeah total total I mean very crazy event there's a video of it online there's a video video of it online the debate last what 30 second is something like something like that yeah yeah yeah and then and then later on when he when he finally agreed to come back into the room because he was so angry with me walked out when he finally came back into the room he was asked a question about gobekli tepe and just like you're skeptic he didn't know anything about gobekli tepe or he claimed not to know about I mean this is that this is supposed to be the world's most famous archaeologist and he knew nothing about this incredible site in a weenie in a neighboring country but one point to make the Randall was talking about the second event eleven thousand six hundred years ago we're dealing with an with with an episode of Cataclysm begins twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and ends eleven thousand six hundred years ago both episodes accompanied by massive floods and the eleven thousand six hundred years ago date I may have mentioned this last year it's in it's in magicians of the gods what's interesting about that is that is the exact date that Plato gives us for the destruction of the lost civilization of Atlantis Plato that's the only source we have for Atlantis it comes to us many people think it's all over the place but it's not Atlantis comes to us from the Greek philosopher Plato who lived around 340 BC and he got the story from through his family line from his ancestor Solon who had visited Egypt in 600 BC and there Solon was told of a great civilization that had existed on earth that was the progenitor civilization of Egypt but that was destroyed in a terrible Cataclysm and he asked are there Cataclysm involving a gigantic flood and Atlantis was submerged beneath the waves and was never seen again and so Solon said to the priests when did this happen and they said three to nine thousand years ago that was in 600 BC so that's 9600 BC that's eleven thousand six hundred years ago that's melt water pulse 1b how could they know yeah how could we have to start taking this stuff more seriously instead of sneering at it and skepta sizing it out of existence we need to leave a little bit of room for extraordinary ideas possibly being right that's the main beef I have with the skeptics is that they want to throw the baby out with the bathwater I want to add something to that in the Timaeus you know Plato discusses Atlantis in two dialogues and in two Timaeus he preface 'as the story of Atlantis by recounting the myth of Phaeton now the myth of Phaeton is a very interesting story and basically what it is as Phaeton was the offspring of hey Leo's the Sun God who was raised didn't know who his father was his mother kept it a secret from him and then one day he was being taunted at school because all of his schoolmates had you know recounting the great deeds of their fathers and everything so he went home distraught and finally his mother said well actually your father is the the big granddaddy of them all Helios the Sun God so Phaeton decides he's going to go and find his father and eventually does and he goes to some you know celestial realm or his father is located and the way it is with the with it with the Greek gods they have unlimited powers except they also have certain restrictions for example if a God makes a promise he or she cannot go back on it right so when hey Leo sees Phaeton has his lost son come he's overjoyed he says I'm so happy to see you I will grant you any boon you want and Phaeton says i want to drive the chariot to the Sun I want to drive your chariot and hey Leo says well I meant anything you wanted except that you know so it goes back and forth and back and forth finally fate and convinces his father let him let me do it his father says look you've got to hang onto those reins tight because those steeds are going to pull away from you he gets in there the gates of the Sun open it describes in the myth you can go you know you can read Edith Hamilton or Bulfinch or any of the great retellings of the Greek myths and they'll describe it in there it goes through the signs of the zodiac and then all of a sudden it careens off and heads down to earth and then it describes this whole litany of catastrophe setting the earth on fire and finally the Jupiter at the the the beseeching of Poseidon who is afraid that the oceans are going to boil away get Zeus to mount his his Mount Olympus and hurl his Thunderbolt which knocks Phaeton from the sky and he falls to earth and falls into the river air adonis which is a metaphor for the Milky Way and his sisters the hell yachties then weep over the death of their brother and their tears fall to earth and cause the great flood Plato then after referencing that myth he then says now this has the form of a myth but what it really represents is a declination or a declining of the bodies in space orbiting around the earth in an eventual falling to earth of one of those bodies and a conflagration of all things triggered by the fall of that body it's intriguing that he mentions the zodiac because because the torrid meteor stream is so cold because it appears to come at us from the direction of the constellation of Taurus the zodiacal constellation that's where those shooting stars amongst which are some very large objects that that have hit us in the past and can hit us again in the future that's where they come from they come from that area of the sky it's an actually an illusion it appears that they're not actually coming from Taurus it looks like that they come from that area of the sky they come from that area of the sky and so anybody in in ancient times who was witnessing and according to the Victor Clube and William Napier and those guys who are the British neo catastrophists that have been doing all of this work for decades on the toward meteor shower have concluded that you know in times past it was an extremely active shower and would have created some pretty darn impressive light shows even if it wasn't causing catastrophes down here below but what they've what they've conjectured is that there might be times of multiple Tunguska like impact bombardment when you know there could because there could be thousands of objects within the tarde meteor stream on the same scale as the Tunguska object and that if if you go and you read the accounts the eyewitness accounts over and over and people are saying things like well it looked like it was being discouraged from the Sun it looked like it was being born out of the Sun right it looked like a second Sun in the sky like for a short period of time the Sun had a twin right well the summertime torrents are coming from their parody lien passage around the Sun so you like grain was saying they make an elliptical orbit out to Jupiter and back around the Sun in this stream right earth crosses that stream twice each year one time late June early July we cross but at that point they're coming from the direction of the Sun so their their arrival to earth is going to be very difficult to see because they're coming from the direction of the Sun right but that's exactly where on June 30th a torrid meteor would be coming from and then also the fact that it's that the perfect date for the peak of the of the shower and the correct place in the sky to me is pretty convincing evidence that it was most likely a remnant of that torrid stream the other time that the earth crosses is late October early November in fact we've just passed out of it within the last week basically but it Peaks interestingly coincidentally between like October 30th and November 4th or 5th so it's peaking right around Halloween time in fact they've been called the Halloween meteors and there's some very intense I work sometimes thing called the Halloween fireworks yeah but there's some very interesting work done by a researcher back around the early 20th century named grant Halliburton who spent about 15 years researching the connections between ancient calendars and he concluded one thing very interesting was that a lot of these ancient calendars were being synchronized by people's observations of the rise and fall of the Pleiades which is the shoulder of the bull the Pleiades comprises basically part of that constellations like Taurus yeah yeah the shoulder of the bull and what he came up with was that in his research he discovered that many of these stories that were associated with us like the slaying of the celestial bull you know Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the in the earliest known story they they fight the celestial boulders many counterparts and variants of that in mythical stories and so what he then found out though was that in many cases the that our modern Halloween actually goes back thousands of years to an ancient day of the Dead that was observed all over the earth at the same time every year even in the southern hemisphere and it usually revolved around a commemoration of the the culmination of the Pleiades which is when the Pleiades crosses the local Meridian in other words it reaches the keystone of the Royal Arch so to speak up in the sky so if you go out on Halloween now and you face the south in the northern hemisphere you will see the Pleiades right at midnight at midnight they will be if you think of the the arch of the zodiac as being a like a clock it's right there at midnight at midnight right well here's the interesting link is that in all of these myths what halliburton discovered over and over again was that the Day of the Dead ultimately went back to myths about of the destruction of the world by a great flood and/or fire it's fascinating that it's all coming out of the constellation Taurus - and it's the celestial bull that they're fighting in these ancient myths and then all these cultures around the worlds are celebrating the day of the dead of this exact same time this amazing stuff and right now our science is closing its eyes to this I I think it's fair to say with the torrid meteor stream which is a very big issue in this whole discussion that we are dealing with a hidden hand in human history it's something that is going to ultimately require us to re-explain almost everything that the skeptics hate it they can't bear it because first of all it involves cataclysms and secondly it involves the possibility of losing a whole civilization from the record it's really it's really interesting when you look at the dates of the this cluster this episode of bombardment between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago that's the period that just immediately precedes what mainstream academia think of as the very beginnings of civilization and they've just never maybe if not even their fault it's this is so recent this science is so new that they've not had time to adapt to it but if they adapt to it and take this into account then suddenly what was an extraordinary and absurd an impossible idea that there was a lost civilization twelve thousand years ago becomes a very plausible and reasonable idea and then we start once we can once we take that on board then we can start opening our eyes to archaeological anomalies like the Great Sphinx like Baalbek like submerged ruins like gobekli tepe and begin to consider what does all this mean are we in fact a species with amnesia are we here forgetful of the truth about ourselves maybe that's why we're so fucked up you know because we just actually don't know we've made up a story about where we came from what we are I certainly think it plays a part and I also think that conservative skepticism is probably prudent when you're dealing with most scientific issues most things that come up that people are claiming I mean there's so many charlatans out there crazy people that are claiming new discoveries but uh in some cases they examine these discoveries as long as they're far enough away from us or weird enough like this new planet that they believe they're they have a 90 planet sign in yeah yeah they they're pretty sure there's something outside past the Kuiper belt and they think it's massive they think it's at least four times maybe larger than the United States or then excuse me the world down the world and got an orbit of about ten thousand years yeah and that's interesting with comets because this huge massive object circulating in the outer solar system through the Kuiper belt which is the source of many of the comets that hit the earth is destabilizing comets from safe orbits and putting them into really dangerous orbits they come our way the correctly from wrong but like what what is the source of all these near-earth objects do is this have anything to do with earth one and earth two does it have anything to do with the initial impact that created the moon is that because we were hit by another planet right during the formation of the earth and this is all scientifically established Astro scientists or astrophysicists rather and astronomers all agree on that right there's a lot of debris would go back to that to that time and but comets are another story because they're coming in from the far reaches of outer space they're coming they're coming in from the Oort cloud and the coital just vast distances away they're their voyagers they're kind of messages from the distant reaches of the cosmos who come in in an unpredictable way because their orbits are destabilized by something like Planet nine isn't there something called bodes law where you you can measure the mass and the orbit of a certain planet and you can accurately depict where the next planet is going to be and doesn't that fall apart somewhere between Mars and Jupiter that's with the asteroid belt yeah yeah yeah which would indicate that something was probably there what in the theory of the asteroid belt that it was an exploded planet of course there's a lot of opposition to that theory too you know you're right skepticism really has an important role to play it's it's very it's really it's really essential that we are skeptical otherwise we'd all be following on zecharia sitchin for the Anunnaki to land exactly it would have sold our houses December 21st 2012 we'd all be going with the fuck now I'm homeless example years later I have to say there's a skeptic called Michael Heizer who has done really an excellent job of thoroughly you know debunking the bogus translations of zecharia sitchin is wrong coms hitch in his wrong doctor it's a very useful it's a very useful site so we hated him and loved him at the same time is so sad I love the idea of the aliens come down and manipulating the monkeys and making us to mine gold it's a wonderful story but unfortunately it's a work of science fiction it's not a work of fact yeah we need I knew him he was a fascinating man I once drove him from Stonehenge to London we had we had many conversations he was a deep and serious researcher but I think he I think he got he got carried away with his own fence I also think that that fantasy became very lucrative and it also became a source of identity to him yeah you know I followed him pretty closely as well I've read the 12th planet and I got really India's research and this is in my early pot-smoking days when I first started smoking pot so I was I was all-in I was all-in and then as I got wiser and then as I got not honest maybe not wiser just I started recognizing objectively why these these things are so attractive the fantastical is more attractive than the practical and so something else again I don't want I don't want to put Sitchin down and I'm here also to say that Sitchin did a lot of really good work he's a clever guy and he had a lot of very very very thorough research I just lost my track actually smoking too much dope where was I going what we were talking about that all the difference between the fantastical and the practical that there's this inclination to accept things that are fun yeah you know that's what I was going to say is that when you start talking about the Anunnaki those from heaven to earth cane these fantastic creatures from thank you you've brought my memoranda Bureau thing I remember I was got to say what's interesting some part because I know kind of once could be good what was what's what's interesting is that the level of technology that Zakaria attributes to the Annunaki oblique Nephilim that that level of Technology is the level of technology that we had in the 1970s when we were you know NASA was doing its stuff so it's NASA technology from the 1970s that is projected out on to that is projected over a gram but is projected out that is projected out on to his theory of the past now it seems to me very unlikely that the Nephilim or the Anunnaki would have had for four hundred thousand years which is what he's saying the same technology that NASA had in the 1970s is much more likely that he's projecting that on to the data rather than that it's actually inherent in the dot there was also some interesting ideas that he had that turned out to be ideas that scientists had also proposed about preserving our atmosphere by by levitating or by suspending reflective particles in our atmosphere and that that is something that the Annunaki in his books we're going to use gold for because gold has such unique properties which is why they use gold to plate things because you can take a little tiny piece of gold you could plate this entire table goals are really spectacular yeah a piece of I mean there's nothing like it right absolutely not there's a lot of really good material in Szczecin but unfortunately the translations of the texts the translations of the texts are not translations of texe they misrepresent the text often what he did was he took a nineteenth-century translation and he massaged it so that it would you know fit his fit his argument and that's a pity so we need skeptics and they help us to sift out the wheat from the chaff but but occasionally what the skeptics do with this drive to to criticize anything that's not mainstream occasionally what they do is they let go a really good idea which deserves investigation and which the human species could benefit from and that's my feeling is with this amazing species we've developed all this science why are we why are we so ready to let go of wonderful ideas well it's also fascinating to me that because of what Sitchin has been sort of criticized for people now ignore the stuff that's absolutely undeniable like the actual stone tablets themselves the clay tablets where you can see the depictions of the solar system somehow or another these people from 6,000 plus years ago had a detailed map of the sources clear idea of the source what's the size in like a relatively correct order in the planets in the right place like they somehow or another knew that Jupiter was bigger than Mars they knew these things in some weird way and we don't know why we don't know how also the caduceus representing the the the double helix of the DNA that's really fascinating concept to that the caduceus is used for medicine that's used to reports that Gaia did so it's kind of too bad there was so much crazy involved in that I think what any of us should do when we're exploring the deep and hidden mysteries of the past is is to go to a lot of different sources go to a lot of don'ts just stick with the mainstream don't just stick with the alternative but try to try to bring it all together and in a way that's what I try to do in my books accept the skeptics still hate them yeah but it is so hard because it's so it's so fun to go with the crazy story yeah like the the alien story is so compelling it's so fun very compelling story I mean if we found some sort of evidence of aliens it would be so utterly spectacular even if it was a simple alien like I've always said this that if we felt like got a jellyfish on the moon we would freak out but you know there's really complex bizarre things at the bottom of our ocean that we've never discovered just they're just not in the correct location for us to be excited and then the other the other issue we're getting slightly off our flood topic here actually but the other issue of entities that that in the encounters with entities anybody who's smoked DMT will know that as I have as you have that will know that you do encounter entities in the DMT in the DMT state and they do communicate with us and there's a lot of parallels with the ETS or the aliens as they're described in modern UFO abduction accounts and Rick Strassman have you ever had him on your show you know Rick got sick he was supposed to be here a couple of times we're trying to reschedule it now yeah but he had some pretty serious health issues now we had a date scheduled out but I love that guy got a chance to sit down with him a couple of times and talk to him and of course you presented DMT this molecule yeah he's brilliant and he's so important to me because I remember when I did it I was so confused I mean it to me it was like the first my first DMT experience changed everything I thought about the world and I immediately didn't give a shit about aliens anymore right like it was almost instantaneous like before then I was like Roswell they've got the they got the ship man yeah it's in a hangar but what I encountered doing DMT was so spectacularly alien it's a pedestrian concept of something that looks like a person but has a bigger head enlarged eyes at high attack yeah yeah it was weird and cool as it would be if it was real it was nothing I mean literally not one millionth as interesting as what you absolutely can encounter when you do DMT that's the aliens that's the aliens that utterly alien realm filled with alien intelligences who communed and of course again the skeptics say oh it's all just made up in your brain but we don't know that and Rick is open to the possibility that we are dealing with areas of reality that are not normally accessible to our senses and that become accessible to our senses by retuning the receiver wavelength of the brain which is what he suggests DMT does and I think I think that's very plausible and at the very least those who are interested in UFOs and aliens should be also investigating this line of inquiry can we can we use changes in consciousness to understand the majestic complexity of the universe in which we live and I think the answer is definitely yes and many of Rick's volunteers I paraphrase but they came back with reports that the entities who'd encountered them said we're so glad you've discovered this technology now we can communicate with you much more easily you know it's fascinating so there's a technology for encountering other intelligences and against that this mechanistic simplistic alien meme that's going around now that they're a bit like us but they came here in higher tech the higher tech it's dull by comparison with it is dull by comparison if you're interested in anybody is the book is amazing it's called DMT the spirit molecule and he has a new book that he's putting out about DMT and the spirit and the soul of prophecy yeah and he's just a really really interesting guy but his his experience that he did experiments that he did were the first I think in many many decades to get approved by the government correct so he did everything above-ground I mean he was above board he was did and because it because it was government approved the his remit was that he had to find some therapeutic benefit for DMT and he couldn't actually but that's not the point I'm sure actually there are therapeutic benefits but that's not the point the point is here is a tool for investigating the mystery of consciousness and the mysterious nature of reality and I mean fact me if we get five or six volunteers who haven't compared notes or coming back with met entities who said we're so happy you found this technology yeah it's hard to explain that as just to reduce it to brain activity not only that when we talk about things that are so big and are ignored by mainstream culture this is one that's just like that you're talking about an endogenous human chemical yeah that not only is in US but is in thousands of different plants like when how many different plants contain DMT huge numbers huge very prosaic ones like peas and you know well there's the money recorder okay yeah that's what I was gonna say the australian oriental tree is actually illegal this isn't that what would be the jerusalem the the professors from the university of jerusalem i believe that any shannon yeah what they were talking about they believe that that's what the story of the burning bush and moses is so that is Mimoza with the DMT and syrian rule with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor in other word it's it's ayahuasca but a Middle Eastern alternative of it doing the same thing we like molecularly and isn't it possible in some way that the idea of the burning bush was them figuring out how to dry or extract DMT never in it very light very possibly right because they're talking about the burning bush producing God yeah and it just so happens that this bush is the acacia tree is incredibly common in super-rich and DMT and it's all over the area and I should probably insert at this point that if you're at all familiar with the Masonic ritual you'll know that the acacia plant plays a central role that's why you're one of them one percent Mason characters every now every now it was inside every now and then on face book Randall I get accused of being a freemason Hancock is a freemason as know it explains as though it explains everything I know lots of Freemasons I spoken in Masonic lodges but I'm an author and I shouldn't belong to clubs you know I went to a few I went to a wedding that my friend Duncan Trussell was performing at for these two Satanists and like 2003 into this day I was the one of the lavas Anton LaVey or Stanton Levay whatever is his son oh and his son got married was some young hedonist you know and they call themselves Satanists and so Duncan performed at this wedding and I went there to this day I get fucking tweets about being a Satanist so I can't join your little club pal no one of your Masons I I need to confess you Graham yes you didn't realize this but I secretly initiated you oh my god oh you're in so he get in how do you self really initiate somebody can you do that yeah no okay yes I sort of did sort of so you could get him in if you wanted to though right if you know the people oh of course you even you Joe I don't think something's gonna happen bro I didn't I met a couple of Masons they're very cool well most masons don't really understand the corpus of symbolism that's that they're sitting on top of I got to say that not to get off on the Freemasons but simply there's a mass of symbolism and that's the whole that's that's the thing that they're custodians of and most of them don't have a clue what it means but they're doing an important job by preserving this corpus of symbolism through the through the layout of the lodge the the meaning of every component in the lodge because it's a purely astronomical allegory and then you have the Masonic carpets and that's where you have the whole story of the comet the flood it's all there the acacia plant it's all there it's all correct me for my wrong but it's it's all also an integral part of how Washington DC was designed is that true yeah just so much I haven't you know I honestly haven't studied that okay but what I've seen is that there's a there's a bunch of videos where you can watch it where they sort of describe how the layout you know is in some way some sort of sacred geometry I think what is based on Freemasons were massively involved in the construction of Washington as they were of many great cities city I live in England has got you know the major Masonic architecture so is it like people like me like my initial prejudice I hear something like the Masons I got fucking dudes in a cult get out of here leave me alone like we we assume that all groups of people that follow anything somehow another wacky Masons in my opinion they're largely a drinking club for men mainly that's what it is guys win at all but they do can make special arrangements to bring women into a lot of my life when I've get when I've given a talk in a lodge I've given talks in two or three lodges been asked to do so then they make a special ceremony to allow my wife Santa to come in because I won't go anywhere without Santa and so women can women can go in but then there are more there are others within masonry who are pursuing deeply esoteric interest and exploring the mysteries and you can have incredible conversations and facet it's just another another group of people who you know are doing are doing their thing it's not for me I wouldn't join I don't I would lose I think if I joined Freemasonry it would weaken me as an author I think I think I'm better able to comment on these things by not being a member of any such group that's interesting why do you think that well because I think I have to remain open to all possibilities and if I if I if I commit myself to a particular line I don't commit myself to a particular religion I don't commit myself to a particular men's club either I just which is what masonry is I I think if I commit that then a bit then ultimately I would become a spokesperson for that and I don't want to be that that makes a lot of sense considering your occupation and how important being open-minded has been to your life it's vital absolutely without it how could you have ever done fingerprints of the guys I could not you should have I mean and the the thing the initial thing where you were to tell me about Ethan that place where they believe that the the Ark of the Covenant lays which is one of the most bizarre ideas ever and that was my first book on a historical mystery with the sign on the ceiling that's right and when you go into it like it's so interesting but I just I've always imagined you as a young guy forced to sort of reconcile with this bizarre piece of evidence you've got these old men that have cataracts in their eyes like they're around radiation sites and no one's allowed to go inside and see this thing and they claim they have the Ark of the Covenant in there and like what the fuck is in there I think was the beginning of a magic it was the beginning of a magical journey for me it's been a magical journey for all your fans too for guys like me man when I read fingerprints of the gods it was to me it was one of those books I just couldn't put down and was so mind-blowing and this is again was in my the heart of my yeah fucking-a theorem and fingerprints was published in 1995 and magicians came out in 20 in in 2015 and I would say in that time the the evidence when I made the case for a lost civilization and a global Cataclysm in fingerprints of the gods I can't begin to account for the amount of hostility and anger and rage that I generated in the academic community the idea was considered to be absolutely absurd twenty years later with magicians of the gods it's not so absurd anymore the evidence is mounting we have incredible evidence now for a global Cataclysm in exactly the period that counts between twelve thousand eight hundred eleven thousand six hundred years ago and we have sites like gobekli tepe we have a redefinition of the Sphinx the whole area is just about to explode in in the future we're on the edge I believe of a paradigm shift and this comet material is central to it what I really appreciate about your courage is that you've also had the courage to admit when you've made mistakes you're not you don't in any way pretend to be some sort of a bearer of secret knowledge no one else possesses absolutely not a guru I don't want to be anything like that I'm a reporter that's that's what I am and I'm a reporter who's reporting on offbeat subjects and to some extent I'm an I'm an outsider so one of the talks I do now it's about being a being an outsider I think there is a I think there is a place for Outsiders in society well I don't think you're an outsider I think you're an outsider from the established mainstream ideas I just think that is what are the same we're both we're both outsiders in that area I'm working in different fields to get into this but don't you think that these established channels that were so deeply grooved in distributing information those things have widened so wide now what you're getting I mean a professor could do a podcast like he could teach a class you could write a book or he can do a podcast on a certain subject and like you're aware of Dan Carlin and that hardcore history podcast I just can't stop raving about what he's done is brought historical accurate but really dramatic stories of real events that took place to millions like you know that's just that no one's doing that like this is but it's not mainstream well what's more mainstream than being number one on the iTunes podcast list which he is all the time what is more mainstream and he must be getting millions of downloads it's part of the big change is taking place in our society that the old structures are being overthrown they're being thrown away it's a very uncomfortable time it's a very uncertain time is a very exciting time right because we can build out if there's something something amazing in the future the Internet's had a huge part to play in it the fact that people can communicate with one another all around the world since I've had a web presence in the last I was late comer but maybe 2 or 2 to 3 years ago I've been getting contacted by I mean professionals from around the world I've got probably a dozen major ones I've geologists who want to know more about and interestingly you said earlier about debating you know I'm always looking for somebody to debate about that right I you know because I have questions and I'm thinking maybe somebody even somebody who would disagree with me on something good still help me answer some of the questions right but I try to associate as much as possible and hang out with professionals in the field and of course what I discover is that a lot of them are working in these things part-time almost clandestinely without making it part of their you know if I go on a field trip of geologists into the flood lands none of them are really work full-time it's all part-time you know they're working for the government they're working for the oil companies or you know exploration mineral exploration whatever they're doing this research into geological catastrophes on their own time right but recently just last summer I got invited to actually present some of my research to the Atlanta Geological Society which is the largest Society of professional geologists in the southeast so I jumped at the chance rather than you know and so I presented hoping that I would get challenged that somebody would say wait a second there's a flaw in your thinking you didn't happen so did you make friends with some of these mainstream geologists oh yeah well I mean I've been known I mean I just took a trip for um in September spent 10 10 days back out in the flood lines and I did geologists with me on that trip so yeah I'm getting to know more and more people who are working as well you know I I majored in geology and cums I still am in touch regularly with the head of the geology department I see her pretty much on a regular basis and have been keeping her apprised of some of my stuff and she has off offered to sponsor me at whatever point I think that I can pull it together as a dissertation mm-hmm but we'll see how that goes I mean my objective was to learn geology not to become a professional geologist that wasn't interested in working for the government or working for you know the energy industry I had geological questions and that's why I made in geology and you've walked the walk and in my opinion you know more about this stuff than 10 fully PhD geologists yeah you always freak me out so what's what's fascinating to me about all this is that I think what you've done has been very measured you know everything you back up with facts and photographs and descriptions and disclaimers you know when you when you say well it's it is possible you will go down other various paths you're not dogmatic about these ideas but you've spent so much time going over this I don't know if there's another if there's a commensurate guy in mainstream archaeology that has been public about it the way you have been because if there is I feel like we probably would have heard about him your podcasts have been the ones that we've done they'd been seen by millions of people they didn't listen to by millions of people I mean the information is getting out there and making a real difference you're always going to have the the guys like I think Michael Shermer is very important and not criticizing him but that knee-jerk reaction to do something to mock something or put down something that's not mainstream like one of his tweets he said you know what archaeology with evidence is and he wrote archaeology like why would you even tweet that this doesn't make any sense like that someone who's not paying attention to work but made all you do is focus on Evan I'm reminded of the Shakespearean line methinks the lady doth protest too much why does he need to say that it's got the evidence you know it's like I see tweet like Fox News saying fair and balanced you know he's tweeting at you with this yeah meanwhile your entire book is based on photographic evidence yeah and all the other various pieces of evidence I mean that you're adding documents to each other without examining all these pieces of evidence yeah it's not these aren't things that you've invented no these are actual real sites that you can look at I'm drawing inferences from them that they don't like that's the thing well what Robert Schoch and guys like him are so important guys who have the courage see who's a Boston University professor absolutely encouraged to look at the stones and say this is the product of water erosion too cute us - Robert Schoch as a geologist as a career academic geologist who's taken that risk and put himself out there and followed the evidence where it leads another one is Danny Hillman Natta with judge' in Indonesia who's been responsible for the investigation of this extraordinary site at gunung padang where work has been stopped since 2014 again he's a highly credentialed geologist he's Indonesia's leading expert in megathrust earthquakes but he's been looking at archaeology bringing his geological expertise to that so that things are changing we are finding we are finding academics who are willing to engage and willing to to discuss I got into a very interesting City email correspondence with a guy called Daniel Loman at bar Beck but from the German archaeological Institute who's an architect and an archaeologist and he was very civil with me and I he answered my question into it in depth we had quite a long debate that's very refreshing that kind of thing wasn't happening 20 years ago yeah that is very refreshing now what about those pyramids in Bosnia has that been what is what is the deal with that by those thing I've been there I know Samos with magic personally Sam is the guy who's promoted the site I like Sam very much I must say when I'm in his aura I'm extremely convinced but when I when I look rationally at the at the so-called pyramids I don't think their pyramids I think they're Hills I did spend with Sam showing me around and it spent three days in Bosnia looking at the so-called pyramid of the Sun the pyramid of the moon-- the love pyramid and so on and so forth I do see that a tourist industry has built up around this and it's a fabulously beautiful intriguing site and the massive beautiful mountainous place but they are Hills they are not pyramids impression is given that there are tunnels passageways inside the pyramids that's not true the passageways are about two two and a half kilometers away they're very low-tech I just don't I just don't see it and for that reason I did not cover the Bosnian pyramids of the magician's of the gods I'm not going to say they're not pyramids I'm not going to write a book saying that they're wrong but I didn't excite me enough to justify devoting a chapter to them there's much more exciting and important archaeological discoveries that are being made like gobekli tepe which need more space and there's some there's some pyramid-like structures or hills in China as well right there's thousands of pyramids in China cien the province of Zeon is just the moment you land there four of your aircraft you're seeing pyramids everywhere I've been hearing that there there are certainly hundreds and hundreds of them distributed across fields vanishing off into the distance in all in all directions they've been terraced and used as agriculture but local farmers grow grow crops on them I went there with Chinese archaeologists they haven't excavated a single one not one why not they said we don't have this was nearly ten years ago I was there they said they probably got the money now but they said then they didn't have the money they said we're an old country we don't mind if we wait 200 years to get with this it's crazy and the famous tomb of the first emperor is part of this pattern it is also a pyramid it has also not been excavated the Terracotta Army around it has been firm the Terracotta Army is amazing oh yeah it was on display somewhere wasn't it where you can go and see it lie they did some kind of trap I want to see that thing I'd want to look at those things what what a bizarre concept now these pyramids so this one that this this Emperor was buried and that had the terracotta army was that a pyramid as well it is a period it is absolutely it's a man-made pyramid the Terracotta Army was buried around its edges not in the pyramid itself so the army was there to protect him yeah to protect his soul into the afterlife seems to have been the seams have been the idea and then there's a mythology that's come down that the within the pyramid is a lake of mercury that there are mechanical devices in there which will fire arrows at you if you go in that there's a whole story about how how intensely protected it is and up to this day it's not being excavated that's so crazy how could someone leave that alone and you know even major archaeological sites like Tiahuanaco in Bolivia for example you'll find that only about 2% of the site has been excavated I don't know how we can draw inferences about the whole site from from a tiny little fragment fraction like that and that's the that's the problem I think with archaeology and it's why we have to you know consider another way we're looking at an image of the Terracotta Army now you know in front of this pyramid and it is spectacular now that I think about it I don't think that was on display anywhere I think maybe they had a couple of them they brought some of them they came to the British Museum there were a number of museums Lee but it's so much bigger than I thought it was you know I mean there's I mean how many there's thousands yes thousands of these terracotta figures absolutely and this period was made out of what was it Stone round earth mainly okay so they just sort of shaped the ground they just dug around yeah they brought in earth and turn it into a pyramidal Mound over the but it wasn't just it's not massive stone blocks it's not massive stuff that's why they can grow crops on the sides of some of these pyramid weird yeah so they wouldn't build these giant mounds of dirt and then dig holes in him and support him well they probably created the interior you know subterranean as they were building the whole thing mmm and they just stacked dirt on top of it yeah wow what a weird way to make a house yeah and then we have to consider this with you know with with archaeological sites all all around the world is that any site may actually not be the product of just one culture but may have been reworked and worked over and used by many different cultures over this is different periods stunning to me um I found out about this because of a friend of John Anthony West who was here with him he showed me he lives in China and he showed me some video of it and I was like how do I not know about this I had no idea there's this many of them also here's one that's exposed what's this controversial ancient pyramids of China that one looks exposed blocky yeah well that is a another thing about China that we just don't have a clue when we when we think about the the age and scale of things we're so silly we've only been around since you know in 1776 is when the country was established it's not really that long ago you're dealing with China you're dealing with literally thousands of years of civilization all rising and falling and taking place and adapting and growing all in this one area mm-hmm that's still in our eyes in a lot of ways it's kind of behind right I mean they're behind environmentally they're behind when it comes to human rights consider this the Portuguese in the late 1400s have rounded the Cape of Good Hope and they've entered the Indian Ocean in their little ships they've entered the Indian Ocean and they actually establish a huge Empire they go to Malacca they go all over the place okay the seas are open to them if they had come forty years earlier they would have encountered the Chinese treasure ships ships that were 50 times larger than the little caravels that the Portuguese were sailing in Bastion you know what the Chinese did at that time they went through a period where they felt they just wanted to give gifts to people and they put together these huge fleets carrying incredibly precious gifts silks and ceramics and they took them all around the Indian Ocean and they just gave them to people so off the coast of East Africa and in East Africa you can find remains of this pottery from this episode and then a Chinese emperor came along and he closed the doors burned all the boats shut everything down and didn't let anybody speak to China for 200 years whoa what a dick well he he felt it was time for the Chinese culture to turn inward yeah and he they were afraid that they were that their ancient culture on one and there might have been maybe a laudable motive in that they were concerned that the ancient culture was going to get contaminated by too much contact with wasn't that generate cultures from other places and that was a factor in it that the constant desire to maintain the current situation human we have to say it's some kind of some kind of human nature yeah for sure I'd love to see some of these images of it yeah let's look as the drone stuff from the chemists that come as Prairie and what what is it please unless let's let's have a look at you got that this Chinese parents are still blowing my mind they blow my mind as well I just can't believe they haven't been asked it's an eerie spooky scene I would I recommend anybody to go to SIA not just just it's incredible how many of them there are and how unexplained it all is and it's again it feeds into my general point is we don't remember our past what are we looking at here okay let's let's can we pause so I can talk about what we're looking at yeah you look at this one that way you could hit the mic right in front yeah okay this is the beginning but okay what here's what really I mic right up to you that we're looking at a place in western Montana called Camas Prairie and you see some hills in the foreground and you see a basin in the background right okay right here on top of this hill and down on the side here you see that there are some coring operations those are coring gravel because everything you're looking at here this whole landscape between the hills are these large masses of gravel trillions of tons of gravel now what we're going to do is we're going to start sweeping around as the video plays and you're going to load us down here a series of ripples okay I see that okay and I'm going to have Jamie pause in a second but let's keep coming around you start seeing the ripples on your landscape let's pause right there right there let's pause now I wish I had a pointer but if you look up you're going to see a flat piece of land like a tongue coming out rounded out Jamie's right here  that's it gets you a laser that's a delta that's a delta you know what a delta is you ever heard of the Delta it's when a river comes into a body of water and it's carrying sediment and because the river is moving along swiftly it's carrying the sediment but when it comes into the standing body of water it slows down and it drops its sediment it builds a Delta the whole city of Portland for example is built on a giant Delta all right New Orleans is built on the Delta right okay so what we're seeing there is a Delta and then in front of it we're seeing rippled landscape let's keep coming around Jamie and so enfold landscape that looks exactly like the beach looks yeah keep coming around with us the thing is fractal because this this is the whole mystery of this that this happens at a scale of inches on beaches and a scale of hundreds of feet here stop again okay Lord now right here in the middle you see a massive Delta yes you know like a big tongue splayed out and then right down here you start seeing the ripples and there's a farmhouse you see the farmhouse then now those ripples are the tallest ones are about the height of a five-story building whoa how does our keep okay let's keep keep sweet swinging around stop it stop this for a second um if you don't mind are these things they're the size of a five-story building what is that like 70 feet or something 50 feet okay so that's those are 50 feet high and how much water will we'll get to that let's see let's see the rest of it and these are just dirt right there there well if you dig into one what you're going to find is they're they're a massive okay let's pause the game look at this this is crazy this is totally crazy this is one of the craziest things you'll ever see this is these ripples repeated ripples in an area where there's nothing else like it this is the fingerprints of the flood that's what it is Wow where can someone look at this how does someone look at this in real you know this right now this is what we're looking at this is this video well my colleague Brad young did this with his drone and I think he's got it on the website geo cosmic-ray is this being played in the YouTube video right now okay all right so the YouTube people are cool with it if you're listening on itunes we'll find it find it on youtube but it's worth looking at it's what my point this is this is mind blowing shit and I think I think you made the crucial point Joe which is which is that we can understand what this is because we can see it on any beach we can see how water flows receding across a sandy medium will produce ripples but here they're on this unbelievable scale where they're hundreds of feet long and 50 feet high where they dwarf houses and they're lying all across and that - what that tells us is that a huge water flow went across this plane and did this you will seeing it from this perspective love which is a rare perspective unless you're in a plane or helicopter or something you get a chance to look at it this way you really get a better sense of what it is if you were on the ground there you'd probably say oh look at all the hills hard to see you don't quite get the impression though we did visit this this location and in to that day it was overcast so you don't quite get the effect like you do when you've got when a low Sun angle mm-hmm really helps you to see what what what's going on in the landscape can I ask you is there a dispute to this is there um no no nobody disputes it nobody knows because this is not from a flood not anymore Wow no in fact it was this JT part let's be fair nobody disputes that it was caused by massive water flows there but those same people would still not buy into the notion that there was this one humongous flood okay so they think into the cumulative effect but this was all created for the bottom of Lake Missoula right yes and this is supposed to actually represent the draining of Lake Mazu right where as I argue from a number of different reasons that this is the filling right Missoula I have a friend of mine who his friend lives in Montana and they found a dinosaur on his ranch allow yeah like really recently goodnight we should go back to that because there's a connection yeah the well the Great Western inland sea all that at that area there was this is a crazy place at one point in time it still is arguable yeah a different way the the water here Joe that did this the way to visualize this is to gain begin to think a tsunami you have to think tsunami because the tsunami is the closest scale of water flow that we've experienced in modern times no River flood has even approached this well no no flooding any floodplain nothing that we can put into perspective right the closest the closest we can get to it is a tsunami but even there you got to picture the tsunamis that we've experienced in the last decade and a half and you know in in Indonesia in Japan when they made landfall those tsunamis were roughly between 20 and 50 feet depending on where you were relative to the to the oncoming wave and how far distance you were from it here what you have to visualize is a tsunami sweeping over the land that's over a thousand feet deep that's that's what happened here and we know that because we can trace the the high-water marks on the hillsides are clearly left the high-water marks are clearly etched into the into the hillsides so we now know based upon the study of the ripples in the water here was moving down it's filling this Basin it's rushing in and a great tsunami from the north of freshwater meltwater coming off the ice sheet and it's sweeping down over this land at probably two or three hundred million cubic feet per second which is an inconceivable amount of water it's it's many times in excess of every River flowing on earth flowing today all at once it's it's beyond that many times ten or twenty times beyond that one of the trickier things about water is that water in itself it's kind of fractal in some sort of a weird way when you look at the actual molecule of water it's almost like we don't we don't distinguish it as being a fractal thing because we see it as like this moving phloem but if you're looking at the actual molecules of water the cup of water Withey that you dip your fingers in which is seemingly completely innocuous and becomes this massive element of change when the volume is a thousand feet high and just rolling over with massive amounts of weight behind out it's that same stuff massive amounts of weight enough enough way besides that it's actually causing seismic responses is only imagine you know how much weight are you talking about that can create these 50 foot high walls but this what's fascinating to me is that we don't have we we don't have a scale like in our minds as a reference like the difference between that little cup and these gigantic waves that you see that surfers travel by jetski to get to you know the off of a believe it's Mexico right ever seen those massive waves they go way out miles out to get to these crazy waves and we ride them in there like 60 70 feet high like that's that's the comparison almost like a glass of water to those waves and then that to the it scales up it scales up it scales up and at a certain point it can change the whole story of civilization almost doesn't compute let you can intellectualize it but it's almost not computing one of these flood flows here is three orders of magnitude greater than the largest measured modern flood in other words over a thousand times greater in terms of peak discharge or volume you would have to scale up at least a thousand times greater than any modern measured flood to get to the smallest really of these flows here because this is this is just one read one place one locale of on five states where you can trace the the literally the ocean of fresh water sweeping across the entire Pacific Northwest pretty much washing away anything that was there it's almost like we have a defense mechanism built in where we ignore how vulnerable we really are like we put it maybe that's one of the reasons why people are so reluctant to really go deep into studying asteroid impacts I think we're or even to pay attention to this stuff like that this could happen and this is I mean the those are not two separate subjects because this is the result of the comet impact on the on the ice cap this this is the this is why I feel that the research in this field is so vital okay right there yeah now here notice this is great that's a beach we go but it's a beef it's a beach for giant monsters yeah what it is you can see in this here that you've actually got three massive currents converging here do you see that over here right you've got a massive current coming in that would be from the west and then we're standing we would be standing looking down current of course this the the drone I'm guessing here is about 200 feet in elevation so the top of the water was another eight to nine hundred feet above this perspective right here and it's moving very very fast and it's sweeping down into a river valley that's down in those mountains you see in the distance and from there it's being carried down and joining up other equally as large floods coming in from other valleys and all of this is happening at once and it's covering five states basically and that's just one region that's being affected by this sudden catastrophic melting of the ice sheets they are dealing with the largest flood that ever occurred on earth it's a simplest yeah this is insane I mean it's insane look at it a lot here in North America and it happened twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and it's story has yet to be fully told isn't it possible there was something larger before like the 65 million year ago one that hit the Yucatan like what you know what kind of an impact did that have well it actually would because if dad had happened 12,000 years ago we wouldn't be him none of us would be here yeah that'd be a wrap right yeah that was a single large oblique about six miles wide that was that was a much more devastating impact than the impact of twelve thousand eight hundred years ago but nevertheless those impacts of twelve thousand eight hundred years ago were really really bad and they did stuff like this and anything that was in the way of this of these massive flows of water would have been rubbed completely from the story see this all makes sense yeah and here's the thing that the Michael schirmer's don't get when you understand the extent of this the scale of this phenomena and the severity the unconceivable severity of this in the aftermath of an event like this what would remain of a city of village a refrigerator I know not a goddamn thing no nothing nothing how much what nothing would exist in the aftermath of this and most things wouldn't exist I mean you find like an old refrigerator or car up on blocks in someone's backyard in the south and it's in 1970s and the the rot has gotten into frame the H is gonna eat it up nature's eating it up just a couple of decades right what's it gonna be like in a couple thousand years we should on exist should not be surprised about how little we really know about our past this is also a comfort game with our ecology oh yeah we've got the past all worked out we understand it here is what we teach in schools this is what our friends in the media report this is the facts not the facts we know nothing it's there's been so much lost so many missing pieces of the puzzle that we're you know desperately trying to stitch together and it's important I think that we actually do get some clarity on events like this because we still live on this planet and we have kids and we have a future and we want to hopefully want to hopefully we want if one of those big boys comes our way well that's that's right but again I come I come down to this which is which is that we are not dealing with gloom and doom and the end of the world we're dealing with a problem that humanity should be confronting we should not be sticking our heads in the sand we should be confronting this problem and that's why I support the work of the comet research group because they are the only people right now who are confronting this problem and really getting to grips with it we should all confront I mean we should absolutely all support them and confront it because this if something like this can happen once what's it's what what really makes sense is how many stories of floods there are in ancient times and how many parallels there are there are and how many there are from North America tells dozens and dozens yeah it was the Caitlin the Indian artist who spent 30 years or so pre Civil War I think maybe a decade after the Civil War painting Indians of different tribes and he wrote a book called last Ram bolts among the North American Indians very very interesting book but what really is interesting to me when I read the book years and years ago was his final conclusion of the book he says after all of these different customs and traditions that have been handed down amongst these tribes they all have one thing in common they all have a memory or a story of a gigantic world destroying flood and he and he this was concluded tribes down into Central America that he visited I I believe the Americas are the repository that the Native American peoples who have been subjected to so much destruction over the years they in their mythology their traditions their memories they keep more of this than almost anybody else it's rit's rhe it's really tragic what has happened in the Americas from the time of the Spanish conquest the deliberate destruction of knowledge that the the terrible horrendous abuses that Native American people suffered they are our wisdom keepers they are the people who passed down the oral tradition and and remember the past so not only do we have cataclysms wiping the human memory but we ourselves actively get involved in the human memory and wipe it we rub it out the burning of the Maya codices by the Spanish friars thousands and thousand oh what was in those documents yeah you know we might have had a whole other story about ourselves if we could have had access to those but instead we're this destructive cannibalistic species that just goes and smashes everything to bits it's a weird impulse that human beings have is when they move into an area and take over it one of the things they like to do is destroy their icons destroy every what's going on with Isis and all these ancient Buddhist structures a thousand plus year old beautiful sculptures absolutely they're blowing them up yeah you know and in yelling praise God while they're doing it it's really very bizarre it's a very bizarre inclination that we have with it so it's almost like we don't want people to know you know it's as a bizarre almost human instinct to wipe out the past and just to constantly keep moving or was there some trauma is there some collective trauma some be please deeply suppressed memory could be but that we that we can't quite confront that's that's exactly the thought I had because I think that's the one way one of those areas were Velikovsky finally really nailed it was mankind in amnesia that somehow we carry this the Trump because once you begin to get to get a handle and you get to get the picture of these events as they occurred and did occur and would have been experienced by our ancestors you've got to understand what would it be like to see you're entirely young completely obliterated starting over again from basically a barren mud filled hmm you know were you that's essentially what these people were faced if they lived at all and so fabulously they did because where we are but you know again the evidence is emerging of major cultural collapse if you had a guess what percentage of the population of human beings just as obviously just a guess but how many do you think were wiped out half of them three-quarters of them I don't think that would be unrealistic no it doesn't seem like it would be and if it was that number and those people that's enough for people to survive and if it was that number boy what a strange fucking mythical past they would have the other the other thing that bear in mind is in the world today our world we have an advanced civilization America you know Germany that the industrialized technological countries and we have coexisting with them in South America in the the Namibian desert we have hunter-gatherers so the the notion that hunter-gatherers and an advanced civilization might coexist right in the same epoch of history should not be strange to us because we're doing that today and that's what I would suggest happened before twelve thousand eight hundred years ago before the Cataclysm of twelve thousand eight hundred years ago that there was a fairly advanced civilization that was capable of mapping and exploring the world creating gigantic works of architecture and it coexisted with hunter-gatherers and who were the ones who survived the Cataclysm the answer is the ones who survived the Cataclysm were the hunter-gatherers not the sophisticated people's a few of them survived and they then settled amongst the hunter-gatherers and tried to transfer some of their knowledge and skills to them and it's the same today if we if we were to have a repeat of the Younger Dryas Cataclysm today I don't think that people from Los Angeles or London would be amongst the leading survivors right I think the survivors would be people like the hunter-gatherers of the Amazon rainforest because they're in the business of surviving that's what they do it's not a mystery to them it's not even a problem they do it they do it all the time they would they would carry the human story forward and ten thousand years from now their descendants would be telling a myth about how there was once a great civilization on this planet so advanced that they could even go to the moon they could fly around the planet they could speak to one another on other sides of the earth but they did something wrong they fell out of harmony with the universe they ceased to wear their prosperity with moderation that's actually a line from Plato about Atlantis Wow and the universe slapped them down so there would be a differential survival rate those who were that I would say that those who are more technologically advanced are less likely to survive because they depend on a complex interrelated network of skills and any individual on his or her own most of them well you're different jokers you do know how to survive but a lot of people don't know how to barely know how to survive most likely so you've worked at it yeah I'm not that good at it but most of us most of us haven't even worked at it at all we haven't got a clue let me fucking open everybody's eyes to all these people to think that you could just go out there and shoot annals and stay alive good fucking luck you're you're probably screwed if you have a rifle even if you have a rifle you're probably screwed if you have a bow and arrow you're gonna fucking starve to death right it's extremely difficult yes to get close you know and yet hunter-gatherers for thousands and thousands of years have succeeded in doing that like that the Bushmen of the Kalahari I think there was less humans and more animals right I think that's also part of the rub okay it's like we're dealing with is that one of the terrible things we've done is taking these giant swaths of land and made them entirely inhabitable for wildlife like cities like you how many people grow food in the city that what is the percentage is it even 1/10 of 1% of people in the city grow their own food probably no probably not even that so you have these massive essentially deserts with where no wildlife exists other than predatory species like coyotes and ravens and things like that and take and then you you you go out from there and then you have these vast farmlands yeah the only benefit of the vast farmlands is the amount of deer that exist now is greatly more than when Columbus landed but it's because they've almost become an agricultural animal it's almost like they're almost a domesticated animal they're a free wild domesticated animal I have a friend who has a farm in Iowa and when you go there it's very strange because he's got these wild giant 300-pound forest horses running around his backyard I mean they're fucking everywhere there's all these giant deer and when we were there it's what's called the rut so all these they're very horny so the big bucks are usually high they show themselves I'm like this is a crazy place like there's all these wild animals that exist along with people and even in a game rich place like that it's incredibly difficult to get to one you have to have vegetables you'd have to have your own vegetables so let's imagine the situation where all the resources of our cities all the yeah all the amenities all the infrastructure are gone most of us are fucked I would say radically ours I would say in fact our civilization which appears so strong is actually very very fragile extremely just a little push it's like when you look out the window and you're like wow that's the outside no that's a piece of glass you're outside it's not that piece of glass in your outside you know the effortless it is it just seems in petrol because you know you pull the shades tight and you set your alarm clock in asleep you're sleeping next to glass yes like it's hilarious you feel confident yet you're sleeping next to a piece of fucking glass there's this incredible complacency and arrogance yeah of modern civilization that we are the apex and pinnacle of the human story that we're the best that's ever come and and and that's a danger mythologically that is a very dangerous place to be when you start imagining yourself as the apex and the pinnacle of everything that's precisely when the universe reminds you that you are not that at all yeah it's a very weird existence that we have well we just sort of look at how things are right now and we can't imagine things being any different no matter what whether it's people that have to come to the realization that they've been injured like if someone breaks their leg and also it just doesn't compute like how come I can't walk anymore well your reality is now shifted and this reality that we have here with this fairly healthy earth could shift at any moment that the the Yellowstone Volcano is the one that's been freaking me out the most over the last few years another big issue yeah an interesting pair would be if we look at small or what happens in smaller catastrophes like we've seen today when we look at the ad for example when Katrina hit and hit New Orleans right it was almost as if the human species separated into two sub species you had one group of people that rose to the occasion and did heroic things they organized and they saved people spontaneously you know because the government was conspicuously absent for five days the first five days of the Katrina disaster and here you had a major flooding of New Orleans and and you had people spontaneously organizing and performing these heroic actions of saving their fellow man and and doing just stupendous things super hero type things but then you had another segment to the population it just went completely barbaric and you had mass rapes and you know smashing of businesses and looting and in and just people running in it wild complete unrestrained gangs just and just committing violent acts at random so in America the richest country on earth did not manage that crisis well no I mean it was very and that was a little crisis by comparison with what we're talking member when Kanye West go on TV George Bush does not like black people I don't remember that but yeah George Bush I think was on day for George Bush flew over an Air Force One and know the window wave yeah yeah give me below but there's there's a lesson lessons in those kinds of events sure we're not prepared and we have to extrapolate from that and and you know if you go back and what you know I often time as a thought exercise think how how would we respond if we knew that there was a high probability of a younger dryest type event or series of events impending in our future what would you do to start drinking there well you know it all depends on lead time right it all fits on lead towards a 10-day lead time like you know the shoot a rocket up there and man I really super again and let's just go hard go hard to the end yeah ten days but ten years or twenty moons then we can do some stuff then we can do some stuff the real scary thing is to scary things one if you survived because you're like fuck you know if you if you really did survive and everybody else was jacked and also in you're dealing with some Mad Max type reality where people are starving to death and they're very desperate and they become almost like animals that's entirely inside the realm of possibility well that's what we learned from Katrina or the other terrifying possibility is that you leave the future of civilization up to those other people is that they survive and they have kids and their kids survive and somehow another somewhere along the line we get better and better at understanding our place here which is what I think has happened yeah and all it would take is one I mean this is as much as people are complaining right now as much as there's riots in the streets because it excuse me protests in the street some riots apparently but over the president-elect what this time is it represents the greatest time in history when it comes to safety when it comes to knowledge access to information the way we understand each other I don't think it's ever been better as far as long as we know we have everything at our feet yeah there's there's incredible potential in modern civilization the but the problem is that there's also very rigid mind control the way that our societies work is it's turning people into drones people people brought up to believe that their only purpose in existence is production and consumption the people forced to fit into a sort of narrow place in the Machine mass media beaming you know messages at us at us all the time even the concept of democracy is absurd when you don't when you don't have complete transparency when there are secrets when things are hidden how can the people vote you know with Alia with clear minded if a lot is being hidden from them that's not democracy democracies in fact invest in in mind control most unfortunate development well I I wonder how long it's going to take before the rigid mindsets that are in place right now on this idea of this resistance to change that we were talking about when it comes to science when it comes to the accepting this asteroid will impact theory and I think that exists in politics I think it exists in religion I think it exists socially the way we approach relationship and friendships and just all of it is evolving in front of our eyes I was watching a movie last night not another teenage movie I said what it is that was called and I was live-tweeting it so smoking pot and writing and sometimes I just like to have the TV on and not listen to it just just sometimes I like to like see some things when just writing things sometimes I know that last night I chose to do it that way and I just got so enamored in this weird movie from 2001 this is a the movie felt like a time machine as like I was watching this culture that does not exist anymore it's one of those like teenager movies where like in college and they're drinking there's a lot of naked women and really racist sexist humor and its really crude and Goofy and stupid and I'm like this is so bizarre because they this doesn't exist anymore this kind of film like this is like this is like Al Jolson with blackface on or something and in a way it's like a cultural time machine like you get to go and for a brief moment see like this comedy that somebody concocted in 2001 which seemed so recent but it's such a in that film you get evidence of this weird cultural change our students a weird massive cultural change that's happened as far as we're we're allowed to joke around about things I'm just embrace it shit in that movie like racist and sexist shit and violence like men punching women in the face and shit like that you just can't really do in a comedy to that mm-hm and that's only 15 years ago and what what is it going to be like if we can avoid getting hit by a rock blowing ourselves up Yellowstone blowing up in our face if we can keep going I think we're on a great path I think our lesson where I'll think about the president-elect and I think we're on a great path it's a hazardous past it path it so it's a path where the future is not at all certain but but Humanity is at one of those moments mother's crossroads where you kind of stand on the edge of an abyss and and you don't quite know what lies ahead and we can take a really great path out of this or we can take a really horrible path right and I I think the key issue is that we do actually have choice it doesn't have to be that way I see a lot of positive a lot that's positive out there out there in the world I do think people are waking up I think they are questioning old structures they're refusing to put up with the bullshit any longer more and more people are doing that is happening in the realm of politics is happening in the realm dealing with the big corporations it's happening in the realm of investigating the past we're just not going to be told what to think anymore that's encouraging but then on the other side there are huge efforts being put precisely into making people think in certain ways whether it's the advertising industry whether it's political messages and so we have to be aware of that and it could go it could go down the drone path I mean like the bee The Beehive path which would be a wipe even bothered to be human if your society is turning you into a work at drone in a bee hive life existence or it could go down an expansion of consciousness and a realization of the incredible beautiful potential of the human race I honestly feel like that's where it's going I do John sleet I'm optimistic I'm very up to missile that's beautiful to hear because this is a time I was watching that John Oliver show it's a great show on HBO very funny guy and his very left-wing leaning and as is his show but they had this fuck 2016 thing where they were just naming off all the horrible things that happen in 2016 though and then just saying goodbye to this terrible year I'm like yeah but a lot of good shit happened this year too there's a lot of fantastic discoveries a lot of interesting observations a lot of people learned a lot of things in 2016 as well and I think that I'm quite a number of American states have made cannabis legal yes that's I think you know there's a huge development it's it's also a big it's going to be a big factor in our cultural evolution it really well well it was a big factor in the 60s it was a huge factor in an in effect what happened you had a very closed conservative society and then you had an outside shock in the form of the psychedelic drugs that came in and completely stirred up everything in art and music and fashion and even into scientific concepts of our place in the universe and time and space and in in so many ways that had just a major impact on the direction in our society when and what would be the equivalent today or in our near future in terms of an outside shock that would suddenly wake people up would be another event another Tunguska event and based upon everything that I've seen it would suggest that events like that are going to happen and probably within our lifetime and when it does happen especially if the message of the story has been out and enough people have heard it five percent of the people or ten percent of the people are aware that there is this major impending potential paradigm shift and then we have an event like that an event like Tunguska 1908 I think that's all it would take because the the magnitude of that event would have been such that it occurred today and you had anywhere from a million to two million people instantly wiped out or a whole city instantly annihilated from a thing from a shot from space what effect would that have on the planetary consciousness in which with this latest exercise NASA coming late to the party finally seems to be thinking about you know that what happened they finally see what happened if LA is hit by you know a 350 foot diameter right in epidemic ulna is because well when that when the the probability models for a Tunguska type event were first laid out in the 50s and 60s and into the 70s it was pretty much determined that it was like something that would happen once a millennium once every couple of millenniums then it sort of got contracted to once every few centuries you know it may be that it's actually much more like one or two a century or maybe even perhaps clustered events where you may have three or four or half a dozen of those type events occurring over a very short window of time but an event like that happening not one that would be caused the extinction of civilization by any means but an event like that that could you know wipe out a thousand square miles of landscape completely in an instant would have a major effect I think on the people of this planet it would focus Minds it would focus minds in a way that nothing else would and I it's not to me is it pessimistic to say that might be what it's going to take or is it just realistic I don't know well I think it's like the the massive impact versus the slow trickle effect I mean is it going to happen eventually or is it going to happen in one gigantic swoop because of an event like a asteroid Olymp act where it kills a bunch of people and we wake up to the fragility of our existence but either way it's a waking up of humanity and that is in process that is happening that is in process now look as a as a Brit observing what's been happening in America as an outsider I'm enormous ly encouraged by the legalization of cannabis movement that is that is taking place here and and and what it and what it all means sure I like to smoke a joint but this is not about getting high it's not about recreation what this is about is recognizing the sovereignty of adults to make decisions over their own bodies their own health and their own consciousness while doing no harm to others that's what it's about and that's a really fucking important issue that is for me that is the most important issue because if we live in a society that is not prepared to recognize adult sovereignty over one's own body and one's own consciousness then that cannot be a free society in any meaningful way and so I applaud the people of America in those states who have voted for full legalization that's a brilliant thing to do and that's going to have an impact around the world because the war on drugs all the ideology and lies about cannabis are all going to be proved wrong we're going to know that the Emperor wears no clothes that you can legalize cannabis and civilization does not fall apart as the war on drugs Lobby have been telling us for ages it's going to it's going to change everything and it's a beautiful thing because it's the American people whereas the American State America as a governmental state presence on the world stage has been the dark force behind the war on drugs so it's it's a to me a beautiful thing that is the American people state-by-state who are winding that back and saying we will not put up with this shit anymore I think what you were talking about earlier is really important to we're talking about different factions of our civilization or creating it to this day they're still creating disinformation and still trying to mislead people but I think that goes to what we're talking before were it's a system and systems protect themselves and I think that they develop almost a consciousness of their own it's scary in a way yeah yeah bureaucracies arm the bureaucracies they've got a kind of personality well even when there's no financial stake in it there's just a social stake like what you're seeing right now with the left versus the right yeah like there's some people like my friend Wanda Sykes just got booed off stage at something last night apparently what she went on some anti-trump rant and then and people got super upset at her there's these systems that are in place this this is this why almost like wanting to fight like it's not it sets us up in this bizarre team mentality where this left protects its ideas of the future and the right protects its ideas and I'm watching these people go at it back and forth on social media and it's toxic and I don't like to use that term because it's so compromised by you know toxic sexuality or toxic masculinity so many uses of that word in our culture but I think that this desire to fight with each other and be deeply unpleasant it's a really horrible hurtful gosling things you see it so often and really I mean vile and from the left too as well as the right the left is toxic toasters the right word exactly and I think that we have to resist the urge to fight I think this is when people push too far on the left that's when the alt-right emerges when people push too far on the right that's when the left comes up and you know that's when you know Kent state emergency you have all these weird factions duking it out that have so much in common yeah and a lot of times the things that they don't have in common it's either because of an ignorance or it's because of an ideological dispute or a lack of communication and I think of those three things are in place at least open lines of communication Lynch is also fostered by marijuana and get these people talking openly and vulnerably about these things and you find out that a lot of our misgivings and our misunderstandings about each other or just misconceptions miscommunications and we probably even if we disagree on things I have friends that I disagree on a lot of stuff with but we're very close yeah because world you're allowed to have different opinions of course that's what makes the world interest doesn't have to be we held at each other because we're weak is weak listen to somebody else's opinion with empathy rather than with hatred or anger we have were too it's too attractive to be on a team make the fucking maison it's very elegant yeah it is man it's it's too attractive it's too attractive and we'd love I mean we love city versus city we love that we love when you know Chicago's gonna take on Cleveland fuck you we love that the tribal is the tribal thing you know we've not really evolved out of that we've changed our social structures but we're still tribal tribal mentality we should nationalism is just tribalism writ large yeah so it really is just like religions just a cult with a lot more people yeah exactly yeah should we look at one more yeah we could look at as many as you want man Oh Rolla party what do you got yeah let's see the next one back to the flood this is the place that I didn't get to take grams that I really wanted okay I really wanted to take you here let's see it lets see it so you're gonna see it second best okay possibly this is the potholes holy shit look at that this is crazy this what we're looking at folks that people who are just listening in you have to go to the YouTube now cuz this is insanity this is as close a like a knot for a dummy like me to look at something like that and then go fucking you for yeah that's definitely a river a river carve that okay what you're looking at there is a gigantic extinct set of cataracts like you would find it Niagara Falls but to use grams to large we're looking at a ridge we're looking east the tsunami wave that swept down over these four states one branch of it swept off to the west this particular branch of it was 400 feet deep when it hit this Ridge and what it did was it spilled over the ridge and down here in the foreground you see the modern-day Columbia River from the top of the ridge where you see the the agriculture in the landscape down to the rivers about a thousand feet well so you basically have to picture you've got this huge sheet of water three to four hundred feet deep it's rushing over and it finds a low little lowest spot within this Ridge and that's where it starts focusing its energy and as it does it begins to just strip away the rock now what you're looking at here is this cataract complex is about five miles across and the otter came in you see you've got those kind of curved finger lakes at the top and those tunnels those are potholes that's insane potholes are formed by underwater turbulence and in a flood this swiftly-moving with this much turbulence you literally have four ticular Eddie's high intensity high amplitude high energy underwater tornadoes literally underwater tornadoes now these underwater tornadoes are typically in this case about a half a mile walk oh my they're spinning at a high rate of speed and they're right there they're probably 600 feet deep because the water pouring over the ridge is at least 200 and you can see what it's done to the bedrock anybody listening you got a wall you got to look at this you have to look at this and then listen to the scale this is this is a gigantic scar in the landscape of which there are hundreds around this the exact location Rundle this is potholes cataract right the exact location that it was to get to it which were in Washington State still yes we're in Washington say central Washington's can be right on the Columbia River just below Wenatchee okay where we saw that where we saw that huge that huge erratic yes giant 18,000 ton Boulder brought there and chained in an iceberg an iceberg floating on the flood carry an iceberg the size of an oil tanker carrying an 18,000 ton Boulder carried on the flood grounds 700 feet up of Raleigh side rests there as the flood waters recede the ice melts away and the boulder is left sitting what we're gonna be sure of that Boulder in a second one of the people back in this part of the country what do they think about this well you know they're only just catching on to what they're sitting on top of he's the first time I went out here 98 there was the the ice age floods Institute and I went to their only location which was a which was in the Better Business Bureau in in Moses Lake Washington and it was they had one room boom in the back of this Better Business Bureau Chamber of Commerce Chamber of Commerce and there was two elderly ladies in there who are basically the the overseers of the group now there's about two dozen chapters and every year there's several guided field trips led by geologists who are studying this in their off time and I've been on a number of these just to participate and get the air the access to the geologists in order to pick their brains but this is this is very close to when a Qi Washington so anybody he's wanting to find this on Google Earth this is a Google Earth image now what we're going to open but before we leave the Google Earth image I was going to explain that you've got those you got those see those lakes those this meandering lakes up mhm what you got a picture is you've got a sheet of water coming and as it's coming over this Ridge it's beginning to selectively erode into fault lines and cracks within the bedrock can you picture that the water is going to naturally try to go into those low spots where there's cracks and fissures and it'll start going from a sheet into channeling mmm what goes from sheet to a channeled in then that spills over the ridge and in the middle you see this it's called a rock blade see that the wrong laid is that debts that yes that's it right there separating the two alcoves if the flood had continued for another few days that rock blade would have been gone and you would have had a single alcove up there now in the next as this proceeds what we're going to do is we're going to go down and we're going to be right at the head of the rock blade right there yeah right there we're standing right there so now you're going to get to see as the drone is about to take off you're seeing the landscape we're looking to the east in the direction of those Finger Lakes and I guess the soundtrack is it not playing the sound not oh there we go in here a little Toccata and Fugue in d-minor oh okay and the landscape opens up so you're on that rock blade we're on the rock blade right there that's so now you can begin to see the scale of this thing that we were just seeing from Google Earth well now the way when you describe it I mean I would have just looked at it and go wow that's kind of cool-looking I would never have thought so that was obviously created by water pouring through that's the problem is because we haven't had the scale of perception it took Brett's 25 years to put the pieces together well also we haven't been able to take these sort of high-resolution photographs cause they're wrong he's right above it till recently yeah that's that's it gives us a whole other insight I mean you used to be $1,000 an hour to get up there in a helicopter now you can fly a drone around you know it would have known yeah exactly GoPro on it right here in the middle ground you see that big hole that's about 200 feet in diameter that's that's a pothole that was created by this swirling vortex of massively turbulent water holy shit this is incredible yeah in otherwise the evidence is all over the landscape oh staring us in the eyes and it's only in the recent years that it started to make sense we've evolved the the eyes to be able to see this and so now by going out here with a draw I've been over this landscape several times in a small plane to see it from that perspective but now like he just said like Graham just said now we've got a drone it can go up and see it from a whole different perspective and and now you can see see they see the man standing right down there on the rock no you see all that little dude yeah yeah little that little dude is 6 feet tall he's not that liveable I mean on the pictures little no no in July we are 4 inches it's it's it's an illusion what's the me stunning that we knew this is really beautiful and cool and everything like that but what's really stunning is the initial picture where it becomes so obvious that above picture we see the farmland and that just it's so obviously cut cut sliced out of the lens let's see the rest of it then as the drone flies over yeah so and then we have what's called classic scab land you see all these mounds these kind of lumps that's what are the scabs on the scab land that's why it's called scab land and again it's flooding that causes it plucking slifer entually plucking material off the surface mmm wow this is incredible and in this water remaining yeah then fill fill the pie yeah God yeah there you get a saw Mike there you get a sense of the rock blade well there you get a sense of what the volume of water muscle looked like when it was rushing through there right and see this is just holy shit we've looked at two features now Camas Prairie and potholes cataract we could sit here for the next 10 hours looking at dozens and dozens of these mega features and you look at there's a whole bar this is a gravel bar down here over there okay see see the giant ribs on it you see those yeah I've never seen those reported in the literature it may be that nobody's ever seek really seen him before or no one's ever paid attention nobody's ever paid a tip but there they are so how what is mainstream science use to describe this this sort of or mainstream archaeology used to describe these features this would be geology well Karis an archeology yeah what would they so they believe this catastrophic flooding is I just think it's a slower I think it's lots of small catastrophic floods they're not not one not one big catastrophic flood and how what kind of timeline are these geologists putting on us Oh two or three thousand years yeah and why do they think that well because of the the ice dammed model and how much time it would take see it gets complicated and because until the comet research there was no credible source of heat that could melt that amount of ice and cause out now that's the new factor that's come into the equation now you look at look at the people standing on the cliff edge they're the edge of the rock would you see them down there yeah so now you get the sense of scale what would survive again in the aftermath not that dude something no not that dude not a dude or his buddies yeah this is a crazy place man it's crazy to look at it's just so when you were looking above it I gave in here I mean you get a sense of it but if you would just show this to me quite honestly I probably wouldn't piece that together but when you look at it the original image it's so blatantly obvious right well that's that's the thing now is we are in this position where we can we can see it and when I take people out in the field what I do is I I prep them first by showing these images from NASA the satellite photography the Google Earth imagery aerial photography then ground photography and then you go out in the landscape and at that point you can start having this framework for understanding what you're seeing otherwise you just don't the scale of it is too vast it's amazing it's really amazing this is you know this is an adventure of exploration that we're just getting launched on this is this is recovering yes recovering the lost the lost past of humanity and if I may I want to make a pitch again for the Comets for the comet research group if anybody I think it's really important it's not it's it's not just a matter of funding their research it's also a matter of sending a message that we the people are prepared to take matters into our own hands and and support those scientists who are working with open minds inquiring into the past and whether you know give a dollar or a hundred dollars or whatever any little counts it says it's the voice of the people as much as the money that really that really matters these guys the comet research group they need their research funding they have an indiegogo crowdfunding campaign you can go to my website press the comet research group banner it will take you to a page with all the relevant links please consider supporting it it's valid it's worthwhile it's worthy work and it has the potential to change the whole story of our past and our future and it's a story that would be incredibly exciting to be a part of and that's what I'm trying to get people to think look there's this thing happening and it really it is Democratic in its own way and you don't have to be some specialist or a thora particularly in some branch of academically approved science to begin to appreciate and understand this very human being getting out into the field and seeing this kind of stuff firsthand getting it into the discussion into debate and in spending more time on this because it's it's such an interesting story and that's where the scientists at the comet research group are offering that the people who contribute will participate in certain ways and this also in the future but we're all wells gays we're all human beings we're a part of this planet we are pedestrians walking along at the unlit we're being married by this planet and all this stuff is alright it's it's your right to understand what the history of this crazy Rock has gone through absolutely this is amazing yes an amazing stuff into perspective to understand this is like this for 12,000 years this story has been written into the landscape of the earth and only now are we able to step back and begin to see the big picture in in tandem with ever greater detail and what's emerging is really it's a really wild tale but the evidence is there to support it completely and this is I mean this is this is what is is the story I've told and magician's of the guns this is this is recovering this this lost memory it really is wild and our time here on this planet has been confusing for so many reasons and the one of the big ones is not not understanding how we got here and that's one of the reasons why your book I think is so important to me just give you this new perspective of how this sort of civilization emerged another problem when I think we deal with all the time is light pollution I think light pollution ever see the stone it's I think it's a really a perspective blocker in a big way no absolute absolutely is the brand old and I were having a discussion earlier about how ancient cultures related to the cosmos as above so below they felt their selves connected with the cosmos they made their monuments in alignment with key celestial bodies they did it very carefully there was a sense of bringing down the enchantment of the heavens onto onto earth in modern societies we can't even see the stars he live in the middle of the big city the stars are gone the light the light pollution just blots them out you never think they're there and you forget actually that you're part of a majestic cosmos everything about it is mystery we are immersed in mystery from the moment we're born to the moment we die and yet our society is telling us so it's all very prosaic and dull and it's just about production everything's all explained you don't really need to worry yourself about it too much because some authority somewhere has it all figured out no one has it all figured out it's not possible I think everybody owes it to themselves to go out into the desert in the middle when when you know there's a stretch where the moon is not going to be out and there's going to be clear skies especially if you live in Southern California you can get out to the desert pretty easy just get out away from all the cities and just look up and it'll freak you out it'll freak you out because it's it's one of those things that you kind of really take for granted because I'm also time the sky is just a dark black featureless thing the little couple little white dots aren't really that compelling but when you get out there and you see the actual Milky Way itself you go oh holy shit well see now we could have you know every year there's probably a dozen high-altitude events that could have been witnessed by ancient peoples that we are completely oblivious to because of our urban existence because of light pollution because nobody is really looking at the sky but these high-altitude events would be essentially equivalent to like Hiroshima sized bombs going off 20 miles up is just outside yeah it's basically like if it's in the daytime and you're not looking right up there that's right you're not going to see at a time and at night if you're living in the city if you're inside the light pollution by the time it happens it's over but if you're out in a completely wilderness area where you've got but you know visual access to the stars and you're aware of that and you're constantly aware of the presence of the sky you're going to see much more of that kind of thing happening then if the cosmos decides to get a little bit more active which it apparently does from time to time suddenly the sky is now becomes a major factor in your in your existence your tribal existence your cultural existence especially if in those episodes you have multiple fireball type events that could be on the scale of anywhere from Chelyabinsk up to tangu sky and that's what Clube and navier-- that's their scenario is these clusters of that we enter episodes of bombardment when we are passing through a filament of the torrid media stream that's thick with heavy debris asteroids of a kilometer or more in diameter when we enter those filaments we're entering a period of episodic bombardment when human civilization is at risk and according to their calculations we are entering one of those in the next 30 years Jesus and that's why we need to pay attention to this because 30 years is enough time to do something about it if we apply the resources of our civilization to this we can solve this problem let's look at a couple more pictures because I'd like to get the picture of Grahame I wonder people are too busy making new phones they don't have time to fix the asteroid thing exactly execs images and Holograms that's my my contention that it's going to take well but again those ago the serious commercial talk of mining asteroids than is that is the way into this that if they can if they can if they can see an economic return for the minute then maybe they'll do the good thing actually for the human race will this have to be a manned expedition like Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie not necessary ok what's the image that won't show well uh Jamie why don't you go to the the folder of the one we opened a folder of Awesomeness the folder for a folder the folder of Awesomeness yeah just let's start with one zero zero seven what are we gonna look at here well we're going to look at some NASA stuff how cool and then we'll look at a couple of Google Earth things and then we will look at some couple of US Geological Survey things and then we'll look at some photographs five deals worth okay let's do it we got well holy shit this is this is an early one of the early NASA photographs taken from five hundred miles up back in the late 70s actually and what we got here is the two big scab land tracts that show two of the big meltwater streams that have left their their scars in the landscape so each one of those is varies roughly between 10 and 20 miles wide and the bigger one on the right is probably 50 to 60 miles long or actually a little bit longer net but you can actually see that when the water swept down from the north out of British Columbia it washed away 200 feet roughly one to two hundred feet of the existing topsoil it had covered the basalt bedrock right basalt bedrock by the way that was originally formed by eruptions of the Yellowstone Caldera interestingly but so the water came down swept way the topsoil and left the bear dark basalt exposed down below the feature that we just looked at is not even really in this NASA photograph it's over to the west but let's go ahead to the next one Jamie with the Snake River down there which is um where's the Snake River Snake River comes up out Idaho and it joins the Columbia and then flows out to the Pacific Ocean alright then we got a Google Earth image coming up ok on order because there's just a lot there's a lot in here oh ok what tell me which number you Emil pol left we one thousand eight one zero zero eight the next one what's going on with our TV keeps going off and on that TV is not really made for the way we use it so it doesn't like the inputs and I just turned it off so I could pull up the next one okay there we go so now we're getting actually a bigger view of the landscape and you can see the two meltwater that's asked a bland tracks mm-hmm here here okay did you have what's called no one can hear you if you do this just just tell me where it is I get it okay so there's the to scab land tracks right then you've got the Grand Coulee which is that dark women going up to Columbia River there Grand Coulee Dam is right almost you almost had it it's where the Columbia River suddenly gets skinny mmm right there that's Grand Coulee Dam that's the widest the most massive concrete dam in North America and it's impounding water in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake - about four hundred feet deep right now all of the area at the top the glacier the green mountainous area this was all covered in ice and then over to the left right there you have that brown area and do you see the kind of semicircular arc of dark ground right there yes that is where a tongue of the ice came out of Canada and it stopped right there and when it receded when it melt melted back what it did was it left all this rubble that can't really be fun armed effectively this it's called till glacial till and where the Glade where the glacier ended that's called more moraine moraine and you can see it's circular where the glacier came and then coming right off the snout of the glacier do you see kind of up a ribbony that's a giant scar in the landscape that was formed by a meltwater stream coming off of that ice sheet it's called Moses Coulee hey Randall I think we should keep in mind a lot of the audience aren't actually seeing the visuals on this they're not I mean they take the take away is that all across the Pacific Northwest is a landscape that has been utterly scarred and devastated by gigantic flood that took place 12,000 it's left its marks everywhere and this is right near coeur d'alene so coeur d'alene is from that that's the residue of this immortal Lane right yeah if people go to the Geo cosmic recs website or the sacred geometry international website they can see most of the images that we're showing well they'll see it if they watch the YouTube video they can watch it and hear you talk about it at the same time it's just the the vast majority probably 90% of our you can just leave the visuals right now but they can and so they probably will so they can go to that in watch it you can look down way down on the lower left is the potholes cataract right go up a little up along the river come down south south keep coming keep coming stop look to the right of the river that's what we were just this man does his landscapes to notice to the right to the right to the right Jamie Jamie how dare you yeah this this whole area so we we get it this all over here has been absolutely unequivocably right undeniably you see this Joe and you realize the scale of what we just looked at and now you're seeing that within this whole landscape yeah that was essentially inundated you'll start to get the scale of the thing and that's what I'm trying to do here if you Joe can get the scale of this in your mind I've accomplished something I think I got it from that one image was uh those a real mind blower both yeah the rippers yeah the well the ripples were real mind blower and then the other one with the farmland and then this massive channel cut into it you kind of get it yeah um the ripples aren't even on this image they're their way to the east has anybody sat down with you and tried to dispute this I mean the people that believe that this was a slow and gradual effect does anybody sat down and tried to debate you on this no this seems like something that would be really interesting to debate I mean I would love to see someone who's a geologist that you know that I'm sure there's someone out there that is listening to this that may have a dispute with it that there is I'm sure but I would love to I would love to see them talk to you about it and go over all the various things the nuclear glass that they find the I mean all of it all the tops like here's the thing Joe at this point nobody is connecting the work of the of the comet research group with the Missoula flood effects that we're looking or arrests except up except us yeah that's crazy most people are like that's crazy how is it possible because it's a missing lady it's it's such an obvious it's such an obvious connection and it really merits sex she scares the shit out of me what if you guys didn't exist what if you guys were never born what if you never wrote that book what if you never been freaking out about this shit your whole life how would I know how many times in the in the human story as this happened yeah where stuff has just not been explored that really needed to that sounds crazy to something like a Michael Shermer a skeptical person well I'd say to Michael Shermer come on man let's go spend a week out in that landscape well he does wanted to bait you he wants to sit down debate you Graham all right let's can we set that up we can set that up I would love it yeah yeah that's how that sounds that sounds like yes it would be a good time yeah well in my mind there's really no no arguing with with this this evidence I mean well it's too overwhelming and the question really comes down to at this point nobody disputes that there were catastrophic floods the question is what was the mechanism how many were there how long and so long how long did it take was it a bunch of catastrophic but smaller floods or was it back to Brett TSA's original model of one giant flood and I think the truth actually lies somewhere between the two and and again the geology gets complicated but I'm writing it up so I will explain in detail what my thoughts aren't after after having criss-crossed thousands of miles of this landscape heatedly and basically absorbed every piece of scientific literature every written on it I've evolved some ideas about what could have happened here and how it happened well I was a grown adult and I found out that North America most of it was by you know what was it ten twelve thousand years ago was covered by a mile-high sheet of ice I was yes thought I was a grown adult in a way no America roughly north of Minneapolis yeah yeah and that was that's common knowledge right I mean everybody knew that anybody who's actually studied the history of it but it never made it to my dopey head until I was a grown adult and then I went wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what and the the idea in my mind that this whole thing was covered just 12,000 years ago that seems so incredibly recent by the way that ice was more like two miles deep could consider the weight of those ice masses pressing down I mean anything that was there before the ice came down with it being ground to powder and then as the ice cataclysmic melts everything below it is washed away forever it's like an eraser for the world iterate see that's exactly that's a great phrase and eraser for the world and that is the thing that so many of the skeptics haven't factored into their thinking when you're going whoa where's the evidence yeah the evidence is you've got to understand is that we have to rethink the possibility of evidence once we know that there has been these erasers of the world that have been transpired and not just once but I mean what we're looking at here is probably the most severe events in the last five million years and I have a reason for using that number five million what's the reason well the reason is is based upon the the the severity of the mass extinction we have to go back five million years to find an extinction event of an equivalent level as what occurred at the Younger Dryas it's funny because what I would call a knee-jerk sceptical person would always say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence is there anything more extraordinary than that image of those farmlands and that giant swath cut into the land that's that is the extraordinary that is it yes that that's very right pretty extraordinary and then the core samples the core samples that show this massive fluctuation of temperature yeah yeah that yeah in prekow that coincides with the mountainsides yes yes it's all there is it obviously all leads even if someone like me it leads to an event and this cataclysmic episode immediately precedes the time when we've been told that civilization began yeah that's the other point which is really important we have this huge punctuation mark and then civilization suddenly starts to evolve know it was there before this is a reinvention those hunter-gatherers like those people that you would watch one of those shows or they survive in Alaska you watch those shows yes this shows a great like life below zero is crazy asshole yeah yeah those people would make it those people would make it and they would breed and they would carry on yeah yeah what is that was it's a 1012 oh you could just say it next to me I don't want to interrupt you Joe no worries no worries look at this Wow okay so that to me I'm looking at this after what you've told me that looks like water that is sort of like receded and left these lines in the Silcock way think think of a bathtub ring after Joe you get in here and you take a bath and the water is basically brown with sediment when it has up the clock is away daddy you take a tub rings you leave in sediment your tub a man have you're quoting Genesis and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills were covered Wow not because I'm you know trying to pump the biblical flood model either far from it what I am trying to drop in pictures whenever I realize here's a great quote and it doesn't matter where it's from because there's so many flood legend you can quote from well the political flood model is the it is one of those myths is one of those traditions that have come to one of thousands of traditions that's think of this the whole ancestral memory of the human race is telling us that something terrible happened it's it's also very unfortunate that's all that's all connected with an ideology that a lot of people find problematic like that there's this issues with that being you know religion of course cult or this faith-based beliefs we must immediately realized the flood is not the property of the monotheistic religion because it\u00c3\\xads found was there in every culture on it also in that a lot of these stories you're talking about massive translations from ancient Hebrew to Latin to Greek and a lot is lost in the process and you're dealing with a lot of these stories were handed down from generation and generation for like what was it like a thousand years before the first version was ever rip salutely absolutely so all that's I mean that is unbelievably fascinating go to 1014 one zero one four and we'll see a topographic map yeah whoa now that you know trifles it's like it's crazy looks like something just what like you had a sand castle or some flats and set up and a wave came in and cut through it and then pulled back the wave came from the north and it swept down over the landscape and basically carved and plucked and quarried and gouged and gashed that landscape and this is one of the places Graham and I went if you look right in there you'll see where it says Grand part of Grand Coulee gr a nd right there with the D is we have a great video clip online of me and grey and we're looking at the this actual topo map right here and then surveying the the cataract around us you'll also notice that there's a rock blade just like similar to the one that we just saw in the drone footage in the rock lay human and you recognize the alcoves now yeah and if we go to the next one we have a Google Earth image of 1015 of this feature and there's the Google Earth image and for scale in the upper left hand I've superimposed Niagara Falls at the same scale so you can see by comparison Wow if you see men deny or Falls Jill I did I went when I was a little kid I honestly don't remember I think I went when I was a little kid I have to check with my mom it's impressive you see it but you the point here is that anybody looking at this and you know if the folks look at the the imagery on the online lays out one of the biggest waterfalls in the world one Niagara yeah not in terms of volume no wa naze of the african or something yeah or South American maybe Victoria Falls it depends you know the highest are the greatest volumes is about 200 and between 150 and 200 thousand cubic feet per second going over those Falls depending on the flow of the river but the flow that came through here was about 350 million cubic feet per second and left this and yeah for going lying on the Geo cosmic wrecks website there's a video clip of me and Graham down there just just by perch Lake may I ask you a question here yeah now if the water that was creating Grand Canyon or the Niagara Falls rather right up there if that all receded and we could see the bottom wouldn't it look similar to what you see in here the one of Grand Canyon no excuse me not with a dagger Falls right there right above it right there yes it would but on a smaller scale on a smaller scale but like on a smaller scale like some of the smaller features that you see right there right yeah and that's the thing you were saying or it's fractal the interesting thing about water erosion and sedimentation is it's scale invariant so you can look at features and coming up into pictures here I've got a beautiful example of scale invariance where you see the small version in the large version and it's exactly the same thing that's why if you go into any geology text they've always got something in the photographs like a a rock pic or a person standing there otherwise it's hard to get a sense of the scale of what you're looking at right so my question though was that if that's the case if you could drain Niagara Falls and it would have a similar feature set to what you're seeing on the ground there well we know that Niagara Falls has been doing that for a long long time about a thousand years of work of the river at Niagara Falls right here you're looking at a moment in time that unfold it in a few weeks right but how do we know that well for one thing to scale of it because if it because in other words how long would it take Niagara to carve something on this scale if it's taken Niagara 10,000 years say to carve that how long would it take an equivalent flow to carve this but it would never look like if you drained it though what would it look like an equivalent to any of these things for you well right here for one thing it's not basalt bedrock so you're not going to see quite the same type of erosion because really what you what you've got to consider is that all different rock types are Road differently right also you know what happens is you have teams of flow so that what you have in Niagara today is a lower flow regime which doesn't have anywhere near the type of turbulence or erosive potential is when you get water moving at 50 or 60 miles an hour one reason we definitely can know that this is the case is because we see the association with the giant current ripples we see the boulders that have been plucked and quarried and some of them are 40 and 50 feet in diameter you see and we'll look at some of those coming up in the next next picture do you have that image that you were talking about before of that one gigantic boulder that was carried on this it's coming up out if we move quickly through here will will get to it so go to go to 1017 and that'll be from the ground view again with Niagara Falls superimposed for scale the Horseshoe Falls the Canadian Falls superimposed for scale now basically that cataract at Horseshoe Falls is about 120 feet in height the cliff wall of this giant cataract is about 400 feet high and then you see the beginning of the blade rock out there and the full extent of the thing actually goes all the way to the horizon but we can't see that beyond there but this erosion goes all the way to the horizon to stone that cut into basalt hard columnar basalt god that was extruded basically with the eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera long 15 million years ago basically but then covered up by a couple of hundred feet of topsoil and then that was exposed when the floods came through go to the next 1018 and you'll see an example of some of the debris that was left behind by the floodwaters when they finally ceased there's the stuff that you're looking at now the bigger stuff there is 30 and 40 feet those would be like four-story buildings down there so those are just washed away by this gigantic river that's just this this right this massive gigantic river moving 50 60 miles an hour sweeps through there plucks and Aires the bedrock and then when the spigots finally get turned off the water starts subsiding and this stuff that's being carried in there just gets left in the wake just like you're going to see any modern smaller flood is going to leave material in its wake the difference is this material is piles of boulders the size of houses gravel bars two and three hundred feet thick and three miles long and they're all in it so see here's the answer to your question is and this is what how Brett's finally did it was by showing that it was the full suite of evidence taken integrally that created a picture that was undeniable to the skeptics it was just it was overwhelming because it was every piece fit together too perfectly to ignores no other explanation other than gigantic hydraulic events and and now it's a question of the detail what caused them how long did it take and you know that's where the controversy is now this is amazing it's amazing and terrifying but what's cool about is it's terrifying but everything's ok right now everything is ok right now so it's well it's like you feel like a be fine but maybe not if something like this happens again well you have to ask what what could be the change in you know in the human orientation to life on this planet like for example I remember the first Earth Day 1970 right when when this consciousness about hey you know what our existence on this planet is having an effect on this planet right and at that point you see this a whole environmental consciousness emerge that didn't exist before that right well I think maybe in the next decade or two we're going to see a new environmental consciousness that involves the recognition that this planet we live on is a very dynamic place and has been so it is the key to deciphering a lot of mysteries geological cultural historical and and paleontological biological etc that that this has been a dominant factor in the evolution of basically everything that's been going on on this planet whether you're looking at millions of years or thousands of years it's just it's such a strange time to be alive where all this stuff is coming together all this information is being exposed and it's as well there's no hidden archive has young has been broken open and the stuff is spilling out you don't know whether you've opened Pandora's box by letting it out but it's all logical a little large it's so easy to follow it's all I mean it seems like when it comes to like a step by step to 1 0 to 9 coming up 1 0 to 9 1 felt like I'm a bingo guy now this one we traveled about 500 miles south out onto the Utah Canyon it's beautiful and what you're seeing there is basically dry cataracts now that you've seen these cataracts you can begin to recognize them all over the place now this has not been acknowledged as being a cataract but what you actually see when you look at the modern erosion is that these features are being slowly eroded and eaten away by the modern erosion and it's a different erosional regime altogether that creates features like this and this is a vast scale of erosion here and when you travel over the southwest that is the most striking thing that you're going to experience if you're if you're you know in empathic with the landscape which is that there's been this enormous amount of erosion now I'm not saying that this enormous amount of erosion was all created by one flood but I think what it is possibly saying is that when we go back over several million years gigantic floods on this scale aren't and that exceptional that there's something that from time to time and see here's the thing this is completely removed from the glaciers any water that would have eroded this landscape was not coming from the glaciers it had to have been coming from rainfall go if you go to the next slide Jamie one thought which is not it is not a disconnected element because because of the massive rain out that was that resulted from the impacts on the ice cap what's this this is Valles Caldera this is the largest volcanic caldera in North America oh it's 11 miles across and here's what it was born out of a catastrophe millions of years ago right and then subsequent eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years have left this feature but what's interesting to us here is what happened around 12,000 years ago the entire caldera filled up suddenly and if you look at right about if you look at it as a clock at about 8 o'clock you can see a breach of Valley coming off you see that you know Jamie can you yeah right there that was the spillover so at the same time now get this at the same window of time that this these flood events are happening up in Washington and Idaho and Montana this caldera suddenly fills up with water and the water spills over the rim and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet deep now what could cause that to suddenly fill up with water and it's completely removed it's not receiving glacial meltwater there's only one thing by default and that would be rainfall a lot of rainfall falling over days and days at a time so if you go to the next slide we'll see what sits down in the bottom of this valley is thousands of these gigantic rolled boulders and you know that their water transported because they're round they're rolled that's what water does it rolls these things now this is in New Mexico see so this is related to the spillway the overflow of all its caldera which has been dated to that same interval when the floods were happening up north the same interval that now the comet is dating to is this coincidence or are the two related I would say it would be very premature to dismiss it and say that they're not related to that because as Graham just said one of the ones that one of the consequences of an impact whether it's in to the ocean or the ice sheet is you're going to have extreme amounts of water vapor injected catastrophic ly into the atmosphere which is then going to rain out in in incredible torrential downpours that might last for days at a time and along with that water vapor is a tremendous amount of particulate mass and it's that rain out that I would say caused the erosion on the Sphinx and tells us that the Sphinx is 12,000 years old not 2500 BC you guys are freaking me out this is amazing this is the most convincing argument yet that you guys have ever made it's all it's all been convinced this is this is more compelling and and then it all the pieces let's go them together ya know the next slide Jamie which would be 1032 which is to me a beautiful example of scale and variance Wow here we have the modern snake river flowing in the modern Channel and then we have the ancient flood channel and which you can see there the average annual discharge of the snake fifty six thousand nine hundred cubic feet but the estimated flood that created the big channel is 40 million cubic feet and now this flood actually was coming up get this out of Utah it was coming up it was part of the giant Lake Bonneville of which the Great Salt Lake is but a diminutive remnant so the Bonneville Salt Flats the Bonneville Salt Flats were the bottom of this gigantic lake that that filled the basins of northeastern Utah and at the end of the last ice age it suddenly filled up very rapidly and spilled over a mountain pass to the north and then flooded the South the Snake River plain of southern Idaho and anybody can see the Snake River plain if you go to Google Earth or any topographic map and it cut channels like this that ultimately led to the Columbia River but interestingly the dating of this puts it again right in that window so that window of twelve thousand eight hundred to eleven thousand six hundred years ago when everything changes yes everything changes and so what I'm showing you is just a little bit selecting random almost dots to show you that no matter where you look you're going to see evidence of these of these events imprinted into the landscape yeah go to the next slide 1033 and if you go down and you stand on that floodplain down there you'll see the kind of stuff that got left behind this is the sediment load being carried in the flood Wow so you got what kind of powerful currents are necessary to transport and I'm standing in the canyon that was cut by the flood those walls are 400 feet high so what we would think of as being like little pebbles at the bottom of a stream gets moved around yes nice grand scale this is like sand grains on the bottom of a modern little creek but or River said that humongous boulders yes and this is what a geologist or geomorphologist would call the bedload the stuff being swept along in in the flood waters be rolled and tumble and geologists recognize this but they think took mainstream geologists think it took along no I mean did the few geological lepers that have been written on this admit that it was a one big catastrophic flood Wow and what is their explanation for that catastrophic flood well that somehow Lake Bonneville rose up and and something right breached a pass and its northern rim but you know is that possible in any way well yeah if you have enough rainfall prolonged over a period of time days or weeks that the whole body water could have raised by 300 feet roughly and then it bet you again you would need something like the comet impact to provide you with a source for that rainfall right because otherwise there's no other explanation for that ever that kind of rainfall and it's known from the modeling of oceanic impacts that yes there would be unbelievable rain out in the aftermath of an oceanic impact and clearly the same thing would follow in the wake of an ice impact what oceanic impacts we have on record only a few of them armed there's one up by Sweden we were discussing also the possible Indian Ocean impact possibly one in the Indian Ocean 5,000 years ago which which creates tsunamis on both sides of the Indian Ocean dated - a massive massive tsunami disposal deposits and again the this whole argument of the Younger Dryas cataclysm between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago the strongest case is the the focus of the science has been on twelve thousand eight hundred years ago but there's a lot of interest in the eleven thousand six hundred years ago as well and the strongest suggestion of what caused that that sudden rise in temperatures are come need by meltwater pulse well one B was a second encounter with more fragments of the debris of the comet this time the impacts not being on the North American ice camp but in a major ocean probably the Pacific and that that then puts a huge plume of water vapor into the upper atmosphere and shrouds the earth and creates the greenhouse effect that accounts for the radical rise in temperature that occurred eleven thousand six hundred years ago more science needs to be done on that it's another reason why I want to see the comet research group funded because this is this is important work guide Amazon awesome podcast mmm this might be my all-time favorite yeah okay we'll talk about half a dozen more key yeah for sure let's roll okay one thousand and thirty nine and this is here now you'll be able to see actually a person in the in the field of view next to one a giant current ripple and there's a giant that's a giant current ripple field we did see this one green this is the West bar very cool yes if you go back one slide we can see an aerial photo I took years ago of West bar it's three miles long there it is whoa and there's an airport down the lighter-colored buffs of is a landing strip and the the airport building there is three stories tall so this whole feature is three miles long and the ripples here are on the same scale as the Camas Prairie ripples that we just looked at of course this is in Central Washington the other one was in Montana so again you as we begin to place these event nodes around on the map we can begin to see the outlines of a really really huge event and all of this is going on at the same time you've sort of this is dated at the same time all this is dated to the same time that you think the impact took place and it's all over that coast the only dates that we have that our hard dates are a volcanic ash primarily from Mount st. Helens the date at 13,000 years but they use that as a baseline and then assume the there was multiple floods and each flood was separated by fifty to a hundred years and what they've done is they've gone from Rex's original model of a single flood into a dozen floods into forty floods and now up to 80 or 90 floods which I disagree with but on the other hand there were see I think you have to understand this in two phases because the anit impact phase is going to melt a whole lot of ice all of a sudden but it's not going to melt all of it it's going to leave a huge amount of residual ice in the aftermath now what we see is that particularly after the 11,600 year-ago event at that point the whole planet comes right out of the Ice Age inexplicable s the end of the ice that's the end of the Ice Age the beginning of the Holocene it's over and and basically what we're seeing here is that there is a great deal of heat suddenly that's brought the planet out of the icy it does not convert revert back into the Ice Age like it did it to 12,900 event C so what we then have is that in the aftermath of this event the whole climate of the earth has been completely altered the whole balance of nature has been completely altered from before these events to after these events but what you have now is a lot of residual ice that takes about two or three thousand years to melt away so sea levels continue to rise sea levels continue to rise and the melting of this ice produces some pretty big floods but not on the scale of what we're looking at here and I think it's my personal opinion that there's a confusion between the two different flood regimes and I'm going to document all I'm writing all this up in detail as a like as a thesis to explain my interpretation of the phenomena over you know 20 years but let's go to that would be so important I would love to see people really go over this with a fine-tooth comb because it's so compelling she's so amazing like just this image itself is just wow what would what kind of power and force would it take to create those ripples those 50 foot high ripples all over the place miles and miles and miles of the yeah and and see nothing since that event has really affected them they're still sitting there's these gigantic monstrous fossil features in the landscape now when they do core samples on that stuff what do they find out like as far as the dating of it like if they get bottom one of those ripples well you've got to find a lot you've got to be able to find organic material right in there and to the extent that there's organic material it basically all dates from the end of the Ice Age the problem is is when you have a flood like this coming through it's sweeping up everything in its path including forests and animals so if you've got a bone in there or a piece of wood that doesn't necessarily mean when the flood happened right it's not a nice layer of said layers of sediment it's a jumble yeah messed up kij chaotic mess it's not like you could just go dig into the side of that hill at that same level and find something that's organic and absolutely dated to that because that's all stone right right it's boulders it is if you saw a cross-section of one of those ripples it's it's just a jumbled chaotic mess of everything from finest sand and silt up to boulders the size of cars and even houses and stuff just yeah that's so crazy go to 10:41 and we'll see an interesting artist rendition by edward Riau who did all the illustrations for the jewels original Jules Verne books and he did a version for Anna straw straw geology text was the guy's name is skipping me right now but I thought it was an interesting image because it basically shows an event on the scale of what we're talking about and what's interesting here is you see that the torrents are carrying icebergs and in this one iceberg in the foreground I call it grams rock from now on it's going to be I have officially turned aimed at graves it's carrying it I can get one dress I or we're talking about it it's now it's grams yeah because I went and climbed that it's no longer the Wenatchee erratic rush is the grammar addict I'm on a drive thank you okay so we got the grammar addict coming up in about three images so let's go to the next one ten forty two and this is basically another key piece of evidence is strewn for thousands of square miles throughout the out of the flood you have these gigantic boulders and these are being carried aboard icebergs let me let me describe what we're looking at right now because as a person is that you there I took the picture so it's two of my fellow travelers okay normal sized people and you know whatever six feet tall and and bounce them on top of each other 12:18 you're looking at probably at least 35 40 feet tall right now yeah and and wider wider than it is tall oh yeah 60 feet wide does that's insane and that was carried by water it was carried it was carried on icebergs yeah in the water oh my god so this one this flood is not just water it's it's a huge thousands of icebergs it's forests up by their boots it's a jumbling massive powerful erosive flow amazing thousands of megafauna are done doubt in fact a lot of the there have been a lot of mammoth remains found in missoula flood sediments they're generally in the Willamette Valley okay let's go to the next image there we go this is I like out in the middle of the Prairie again you got thousands of these things I'll tell you what I'm a chicken I wouldn't stand right there I think that thing's gonna roll on top of you that would be a wrap son yeah this is known as Yeager raw that thing's huge and is that you want to eat there no that's one of my try took the pictures tell him stand there yeah I said stand there and I had the other guys go around the back Rock Bush I this thing is kind of hanging off the side of that hill the way some of those Hollywood Hills houses are uh-huh on stilts see that that that rounded mass of stuff that it's sitting in is called a Berg Mound and you see these icebergs are not clean ice they're dirty they're filled with gravel and debris so in a Berg when a Berg that's being carried in the flood and the floodwaters subside the Berg's get stranded in the land they then melt and if there's no Boulder there's just a mound if there's no gigantic Boulder there's just a mound but if there is a gigantic Boulder being carried aboard the iceberg it will be sitting in a berg mound like you see right that's amazing so that white line that we see was where the iceberg was when it deposited that thing than it just melted from there no that's actually a bedding plane between two different kinds of basalt so okay so the mound itself below it is what you're saying is the burgh mound that's the Berg Mountain and the boulder the big boulder was the cargo sitting on top of the iceberg okay so the Berg is not just water it's water with a bunch of dirt and all kinds of other shit in as well yeah and so when it melts that's what it leaves behind it leaves bhai that's amazing okay in the next image we have the hancock array that you up there well that's me on top of that back in the eighteen thousand tunnel there once you bryggen walk yeah I was I do that from time to time but it but it it's an amazing experience to stand there and to think what transported this well we know it was transported in an iceberg and it was dumped there on the side of that Valley and it's just the thought of thousands of these things plowing along at 60 or 70 miles an hour carried on a gigantic flood how do we have anything left you know no wonder no wonder we've forgotten our past and say and here's the thing I mean what we're doing here is we're looking where these flood events are preserved the most spectacularly and the reason is is because you had a very steep gradient from the ice sheet elevation to the Pacific Ocean but like Graham and I when we traveled across we traveled across the Continental Divide and traveled from the Rocky Mountains to the Twin Cities which is on the Mississippi River and all the way across we were caught crossing huge meltwater Cooley's we crossed the Missouri River Valley which is an under fit stream just very similar to the snake where the modern Missouri is just a little ribbon of river occupying this massive meltwater channel of which there are hundreds across the plains and then when we got to Minneapolis we went up and we visited some of the larger known PHA mazing potholes we go again you're looking on the scale of giants this is this is beyond imagination what you look at and and the only this the flood explanation makes sense of it go to go to 1:05 for Jamie and you'll see there we go I'm down inside the pothole one of the potholes hanging up at gram so that's a pothole carved into stone by whirlpool yeah picking up rocks in them and the rock said the erosive agent that's cutting out the pothole just think like a massive hydraulic drill Wow just picking up you know coarse rock and then just good drilling literally drilling holes 50 60 80 feet deep again go to the YouTube please if you're listening to this just go just you gotta fast forward to this this is insane this image is insane just thinking of watching rocks spin around now reeling into the ground and you're talking about over a short period of time oh yeah probably you know I'm guessing you know these giant meltwater floods this is right along the st. Croix River which forms the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin it was probably of several weeks duration as its peaked at its peak and so the drilling of the bedrock probably was accomplished within that time span what I wouldn't give to know what that was like just to see it well you'd have had to be in an orbit to survive it right yeah even if you're flying over in a plane probably they're just the atmospheric change this is on top of these flood sediments from I've documented it from Ohio to Washington State there are thick layers of loss now Loess is this strange topsoil that came down and it's they've been arguing for generations is it when deposited or water deposited but the curious thing is it seems to be both wind and water deposited but I think the obvious explanation for it is this that when you see the like the top layers of the flood sediments particularly in the back flood regions where the where the water was calm or rather than so torrential you see these layers these beautiful they're called rhythmites they're very rhythmical on top of that is a layer of this lost topsoil with this vertical structure right well to me and again without getting into the technical background I think the logical explanation and most likely explanation is that at the tail end of the the final flood flows what you're seeing is is a rainfall of mud and this rainfall of mud came down and which many ancient traditions speak of yes black bituminous rain mud falling from the sky darkness a time of darkness it's all described in the myth myths are the memory banks of humanity we should not call the myths we should call them memories yeah exactly and again this this muddy rainfall perfectly fits the whole narrative and yeah with the mythology it's it's right there when we think of these the the idea of these tsunamis we think of water that you can see we're most likely dealing with the entire air around you filled with a rental downpour and solid matter everything's flying through the air slurry incredible winds incredible winds yes so it's both wind and water and just full-on chaos super hurricanes its nature gone chaotic and crazy on ultimate steroids wow this is what it's so wild and it's real that's the thing this time while people were alive oh yeah and after a while people were alive absolutely it's not a dinosaur thing no it happened a blink of an eye ago it happened it happened when anatomically modern humans had already been around for two hundred thousand years writing well no they but not according to the Orthodox historians but if we're dealing with a lost civilization which I believe to be the case then yes it's totally totally makes sense mmm completely totally makes sense yeah and it's time it's time to get to grips with this it's time to move move forward to the next level and start recovering our memory yeah we also start recognizing this is this is a potential reality yeah this is a not just the past this is very possible and and again if I may say so crowdfunding it's the opportunity for the people to give their voice show can you show that page this is the the crowdfunding page for the comet research group and it's on in the link is on Graham hanger there it is so if you go to Graham Hancock comm and click on the comet research group banner then you'll you'll get taken immediately to the crowdfunding page please support it whatever you can give it'll make all the difference it sends a message that we that we care about alternative heretical research and also while you're at my website I put up there a lot of other follow-ups to this podcast if people want to go places I'm talking in America in the next weeks yes and links and connections a lot of stuff related to this podcast is yes mine I'd like to plug my DSD that has a lot of these images on it okay it's about five hours of stuff blu-ray and if they go to the website sacred geometry international you have that available as a download it's gonna be if it's not already yeah I think it is available for a download yeah my laptop doesn't even know no in other words yeah nobody's does anymore the answer is yes okay if it's

Jamie's in all right let's dance so much everybody see you soon  [Music] you  [Music]", "CQ6CvAv_lys": "", "u7zdx8T1ATI": "I heard you get us bad real bad we're gonna quality work and you know T building two we'll call it that see what it looks not even if you want to quit then just say I quit and you're done okay I'm going to try to get each and every single one of you guys quit today and it's probably take about 20 minutes for the first person goes  okay from here from here we're going to change out you guys will immediately go into the ocean okay  welcome to buzz this is an Olympic water pool anymore this is a step in the model world okay so from here we'll change out we're going to go play some ocean games for an extended period of time  just 2005 I was like the Plymouth with the army we were hitting a target on the border between Baghdad and Fallujah I was walking point for the element at the time which this means I was the first guy in the line I hopped over a wall I was making my way to a front door and I got shot in the hip from about 12 feet away by an Iraqi insurgent and it was myself in a courtyard and two other Navy guys both of the other name you guys will also wounded at the same time I was basically laying flat on my back and underneath the vehicle at the time and the army guys would not come over the wall to help us but the two Navy guys who were not engaged in the firefight knowing that they were protected by maan the wall came over the wall and drugged me out of the courtyard and the rest of the guys out there so teamwork that's what teamwork means to me they instead of just talking about how there's no I in team and our courage commitment and you know buddies till the end and all that they hopped over a wall when people were trying to kill us and pull this out of there and I think that directly relates to the training in the background that we all have because I know all those guys I'd known him for years I've worked with him every single day they were on my team that's what being a team means in the seals you're willing to sacrifice yourself for your friend that's what it means it's a little bit harder than the sporting environment because you guys are going for it's not life and death you know you're going for physical dominance of a sport or in this case shooting for an Olympic gold medal right doesn't mean you guys can't sacrifice yourselves for each other just like those guys did for me it's just the setting what you're doing it so I think it's more than mindset that people have when they leave this place that's important and I think that's the biggest change of people and have for themselves and they come here  or advice  I want you guys going out to be deep water  ah  I notice you guys are laughing

get by a secretary on the Berber with all that sir right", "40kggXa-ZQQ": "Mohammed Ali had done the impossible recapturing the heavyweight title from George Foreman but he was not satisfied there was one man who given him too much trouble one man who could be pointed to as evidence that perhaps Ali was not the greatest of all time that man was smokin Joe Frazier the two had met twice previously their first encounter the fight of the century had already become ingrained in American psyche as one of the greatest matches in history the insane action had been fueled in part by the intense personal dislike the two champions felt for each other Ali had so enraged Joe that in his locker room before the fight Frazier had prayed to God to help him kill Ali when the fight first began Ali had seemed capable of handling Frazier easily proving himself the first opponent with the talent to read Frazier's erratic rhythm the reflexes to spot small openings and the speed to take advantage of them but then Frazier had begun to penetrate all these defenses his erratic Bob's and weaves getting past Ali's renowned rapid-fire lead hand Frazier was soon dumping shots into his rivals body doubling him over and enticing him to lower his guard the result was a back-and-forth battle for the ages but the way Frazier leaped into his lead hook let him rapidly cover an incredible amount of distance and it was Ali who had tasted the canvas cementing Frazier's triumph and destroying any and all doubt about who was a real heavyweight champion of the world the two would meet again only a few years later circumstances have changed and both were now top contenders fighting for a chance to take their title back from George Foreman the two men's intense dislike for each other was again showcased on national television a few days before the bout when a real fight broke out between them on the set of a talk show for their second fight Ali had planned numerous ways to negate Frazier's aggressive style he stopped short to lead him into flurries kept his elbows and tight when clinching so Frazier could not pummel his hands through and use Frazier's head movement against him using one punch to lead Frazier into another but Frazier begin to time encounter Ali's uppercuts a punch that had been a major boon to him just a few rounds prior Ali had been forced to push Frazier back and fight him toe-to-toe in the center of the Ring moving towards Frazier's hook to cut angles and stay center Ali's stole the later rounds turning the fight around and avenging his loss leading up to the fight Ali continued his old shenanigans holding up a gorilla meant to represent Frazier and proclaiming it'll be a Killa a chilla a Thrilla when I get the gorilla in Manila as always Frazier was not amused to quote the man himself I still despised him for trying to misrepresent me to the public no one gave his heart and soul to the sport as I did this was a nasty envious mean-spirited egomaniac who still couldn't stand the fact that in the biggest fight of his life I'd put him on his ass no one could have suspected that this fight would surpassed the other two becoming the only one of their dream counters where one fighter did not make it to the final round the night came and both men stood squared up in the center of the ring for the third time Ali yelled threats at his rival wide eyed Joe simply retorted I'm gonna kill you clay you're dead Ali's corner was managed by the legendary coach Angelo Dundee his opposite for this fight was Eddie Futch considered by many to be the greatest coach who ever lived the bell rang Ali planted himself in the center of the Ring squared up flat-footed hands high true to his word he let his fists fly early looking to knock Frazier out in the first round despite all of his talk no one had predicted that Ali would actually come out too aggressively it was like the two had picked up where they left off in their first fight almost as if this were simply the next round although Ali was being reckless opening up so quickly against Joe Frazier there was a method to his madness Frazier was known to be a bad starter his style required time to read his upon his tempo and get into a groove only then could he slip and weave his way inside to crowd encounter Ali looked to take advantage of Frazier before he had time to figure him out so we set a furious pace and threw his hardest shots from the opening bell Frazier's plan was to rush Ali and hurry him into making a mistake he bobbed down low and presented himself as an easy target looking to draw and counter his hands fluidly switching from high guard to cross guard much his plan for Frazier was to have him once again counter Ali's unorthodox open uppercuts he waited into Ellie's punches crouching low before splitting into his blows but unfortunately for Frazier Ali was not throwing uppercuts a punch known for being the most defensive strike in a boxers toolkit Ali was all offense eventually Frazier tempted fate one too many times it was not an uppercut but a tight hope that slammed into Frazier as he charged in stunning him when Ali saw his unshakable unstoppable rival wobbled in the first round he went ballistic unloading everything he had but Frazier was made of tougher stuff and got in Tally's rhythm just in time weaving in between his attacks and pressing forward put al ly on his back foot Frazier walked to his corner having lost the first round but with far better chances of winning the fight for having gotten past it the second quickly arrived only a few seconds in something happened that would drastically changed the course of the fight Ali grabbed the back of Frazier's neck looking to reserve his energy early so he could later explode into action but the referee who had received a talking from Frazier's coach about this exact scenario pulled Ali's hand away when Ali tried the tactic again a moment later referee once more warned Ali astonishing him by putting his own hand over Li's neck to make sure he got the point Ali was quickly forced to change tactics he now looked at slow Frazier's pursuit by employing an extended guard holding his lead hand in front of Frazier's eyes Ellie tracked his head movement steering him off course and blocking his vision if Ali could not smother Frazier's attacks at close range than it was best to not let him get close at all Ali a master boxer expertly led Frazier into his punches he used slower offered them faints to entice Frazier into slipping into vulnerable positions and then up the cadence of his next punches to exploit the new opening but despite that Frazier only up the pace undeterred as always Frazier managed to close the distance Allie's extended guard left his stomach and ribs wide open and this was a major vulnerability against Joe Frazier unable to clinch when Frazier did get through his defenses Ali was forced to simply cover up taking the brunt of Frazier's lethal hooks on his guard before pushing him back to the center of the Ring the bell sounded the end of the round annoyed at Frazier's relentless aggression even after having taken several high-impact blows Ali yelled you dumb chump use Frazier walked away Frazier waved him off dismissively Ali still believing an early knockout to be a certainty blue kisses to the crowd in between rounds at the start of the third he made the few punches Frazier had landed in the second appear to be pure luck he now paired his tight guard with his extended lead hand mixing in his off beat jab to set up harder shots but Frazier who Angelo Dundee referred to as an energizer bunny in boxing trunks shrugged off Ellie's punches as if they were nothing and marched forward closer and closer  Ali was catching Frazier with the same tight hooks that had rocked him in the first but Frazier didn't seem to notice he was getting hit Ali's faints were still setting up several solid shots but Frazier was now just simply taking them and returning one of his own it was becoming more and more dangerous broadly as Frazier got into his groove all out of room Ali shelled up in the corner he invited Frazier to unload on his guard pushed him away and then just as he had against George Foreman called him back according to the referee Ali was reciting derogatory poetry for Frazier as he weld on him as if you were trying to win a boxing match and a rap battle all at the same time Ali's hope was that he can incite Frazier into throwing wide unfocused sloppy punches that he could then deflect smother and throw off course just as he had done with George Foreman butthis Frazier put it was no dope he was gonna rope this time sit on the ropes and he was gonna pay I hit the chump whenever and wherever the way Rocky Marciano used to do to guys arms ribs whatever was exposed I beat on it while it may have looked as though Ali was simply brushing aside Frazier's blows to the spectators in the crowd each punch Ali absorbed required pinpoint accuracy and timing to deflect the impact and keep his guard intact Frazier knew that Ali was bluffing and would be incapable of such a feat in just a few short rounds after a minute on the ropes Ali's suddenly opened up throwing a flurry of six punches in under a second Frazier blocked or weaved around each one of them then countered Ali's next attempt Ali tried again this time missing five in a row but now was Ali's chance to show his resilience throwing a fourth blinding fast flurry again Ali missed and again Frazier countered now I'll lead through for a fit time Joe returned fire but Ali rode the hook back sidestepped off angle and finally caught Frazier with two thudding rear hands Fraser charged forward looking to pay Ali back and then some but unlike Frazier Ali could fight just as well moving backwards as forwards he rebounded off his back foot catching Frazier with the chopping right and landing flush with a long lead hook not to be outdone Frazier gave chase catching Elie with the best punch he'd landed so far Ali tried to play it off wobbling his legs dramatically but the reality was he'd been shook it was only the third round the Thrilla in Manilla was beginning to surpass the two epic fights that came before it now going into the fourth each man had already been badly shook by the other with any other pair of fighters this may have made them more cautious more calculating the round began with the same fire in fury as the last had ended Frazier crowded Ali weaved under his attacks and landed a solid shot of his own but Ali gave it less thought than a mosquito continuing to throw and ducking underneath Frazier's returned fire to escape the ropes he knocked Frazier off-balance as he pivoted away and then caught him from the side with the sneaky jarring right the punch seemed to set the tone of the round which proved overwhelmingly favorable for Ali he led with crosses pounding them into Frazier skulls  he ducked outside of Frazier's hooks and controlled distance with both hands using one to lead Frazier's head into the other but Frazier's coach was not concerned he figured that Frazier's frenzied pace was rushing out Lee not allowing him time to set himself and get the full weight of his body into his punches only time would tell if you were right Frazier meanwhile started to pick away at any opening he could find he received a warning from the referee on a low blow but continued to target Ali's hips destroying his mobility Frazier had done the same during their first encounter and Ali had been in pain each time he took a step for a week afterwards but despite Frazier's best attempts the fourth had clearly belonged Ali the fifth would not be so kind to the champion within the first minute of the fifth it became apparent the cracks had started to appear in Ali's defense Frazier was becoming better and better at getting around Ali's long lead hand which he referred to derisively as his feather duster he discovered he could knock Ali's arms side and come up underneath exploiting his exposed ribs now he began to dismantle Ali's high guard as well jabbing high to provoke Ali to raise his hands and then sinking in a deep shot that torn to his ribs inch by inch Frazier moved in closer with each exchange as Frazier himself put it I began to rev the engine and taking on clay you have to crowd him and accelerate the tempo lot let him work at the pace he wants hurry him and he'll begin to huff and puff it became a battle of survival now that's my kind of fight Frazier soon had Ali pressed up against the ropes his arms weary his legs tired he no longer had the strength to shell up and hold firm as he had done in the second he tried to fight from across guard his body turned away shielding himself from the Brawn to Frazier's attacks the great irony which Ali probably would not have appreciated at the time was that years ago the legendary Archie Moore had tried to teach Elli how to use the cross guard so that he didn't always have to rely on his speed and mobility but Ali had retorted that he didn't need it as he planned to retire young there is no doubt that Frasier had started to smoke he dodged almost every punch Ali threw pushed him back into the corner when he tried to escape and pummeled his hands through to break Ali's guard and set up short jarring punches Frazier at last had the chance to follow through on fucha strategy he lept out of his Crouch to avoid Ali's uppercut slamming a tremendous hook into the champions jaw all said and done Ali was trapped against the ropes for nearly two minutes if the 5th could be called challenging for Ali the 6th was nothing but a complete disaster Frazier was now timing the tight lead hooks that Ali had used to rock him in the first a leaping gazelle punch whipped Ali's head back near the start of the round and another connected knot soon after  he chased le from corner to corner short body shots tenderizing his ribs and hips but while Ali may not have had the best guard his head movement was still otherworldly a well-timed turn of his head was often all that saved him from fighting punches although was bad Ali wasn't out of the fight yet halfway through the round he caught Frazier with another tight lead hook that sent his mouthpiece flying across the ring the announcers mistakenly thought the mouthpiece had been Ali's and Frazier all too happy to go along with the story letter bragged about knocking Ali's mouthpiece across the ring in his autobiography but all said and done he may as well have as Ali walked back to his corner all thoughts of an easy fight an early knockout had vanished from his mind now it was about survival in the corner Dundee berated Ali telling him we blew those rounds you don't rest on the ropes against Joe Frazier Ali knew he was right he was in this for the long haul and if he wanted to win he needed to even up the rounds he decided it was time to pay Frazier back Ali danced and kept dancing skipping cross stepping and pivoting across the ring his legendary jab whipping out like a snake it pestered Frazier targeting either eye lashing out from three different directions occasionally accompanied by a sort of rear hand jab as Ali skewed his hips to work different angles most importantly is set up Ali's stronger punches but Elly could not dance forever for all the punches Frazier had taken punches that had knocked out far bigger stronger men he was somehow coming faster than ever Ali was forced to rest on the ropes more and more often the last minute of the round unable to clinch he took a multitude of tremendous blows as he walked back to the corner he knew that he did not have enough left to dance the next time the Bell called him out to fight for the last round Ali had flown across the ring but now Frazier had clipped the butterfly's wings but if Ali could no longer float like a butterfly he could still sting like a bee in the 8th unable to dance unable to clinch ally instead stood his ground and went toe to toe with smoke and Joe Frazier the result was one of the most brutal rounds in the history of combat sports allele ended early and often barely bothering to set up his shots this was not intelligent boxing this was target practice Frazier was taking two or three shots to land one big one a strategy that had served him well before but these were not the light stinging shots that Frazier had become accustomed to taking from Ali Ali's set himself low rounded his center and loaded his punches with the full force of his body becoming frustrated Frazier through a tremendous hook but Ali pulled back and now Frazier had thrown his body out of position Ali took full advantage of the situation but then midway through the round it became apparent that Ali had given all he had to give he had punched himself out and now his arms were just as tired as his legs Frazier spent the remainder of the round destroying Ali's body persuading Ali to lower his guard so he could target his head  at one point he pounded a thudding shovel hook until all these stomach that knocked his hips back into the ringpost drawing gasps from the crowd Ali was happy to leave the eighth behind him it was unclear to many how either man had remained standing in the corner Ali's ring doctor was wondering the same thing Ali thought he was dying he would later recall he was at the ends of exhaustion who was having trouble staying awake between rounds this time Ali would not be so quick to recover he spent the majority of the next two rounds and sluggish retreat most of his punches selling harmlessly over Frazier's head although he landed well occasionally Ali mostly spent his time dancing from corner to corner before languishing on the ropes throwing little clinching when he had the chance and covering up the best he could a small respite for Ali was that Frazier had now started to let his emotions get the best of him and was wasting shots hunting Ali's head while he still had an upright posture had Frazier stuck to fudge his plan and battered his arms the champion may have lost his ability to punch as well as dance still while it could have been worse for Ali the situation was far from ideal by the end of the tenth Frazier had evened up the fight Ali decided it was time to test his legs he came out dancing Frazier quickly caught his prey driving a hard hook into Ali's chest and shoving him into the ropes but Ali turned Frazier and now it was Joe against the ropes for the first time in the fight Frazier stopped moving forward he stood there bobbing and weaving to stay safe Frazier broke the still mate with a leaping left hand but his pursuit now came in increments Frazier would later explain for me this night was a towering one given how damn hot it was in the arena 110 degrees they said when I'd suck an air it was like walking into an oven Frazier swatted a lazy right-handed LD near the corner and now he repaid him with the left hook off a tight cross jerking Frazier's head around the punch seemed to finally wake Frasier Frasier up the pace and now was Ali who dramatically slowed taking a shearing uppercut as he tried to clinch and then three solid blows to the body just a few seconds later Ali stayed in the corner for a full minute Frazier beating on him with either hand doubling up on hooks to the body and head it seemed that Ali's rally had been short-lived the last gasp of a dying man but according to Ali his time on the ropes in the 11th was painful but necessary he would later explain his behavior in the round a man who rides a horse and starts off too fast is gonna have his horse tired before the race is over you gotta know when to speed up when to coast and when to rest while Ali was able to pull away from many head shots he was allowing his body to be used as a punching bag it was a completely reckless strategy but it paid off with under a minute left Ali his strength returned grabbed onto Frazier and pulled him to the center of the rein startled Frazier tried to grab on to the ropes but the ref helped to rip his hand away the two men now stood in the center and threw Ali paying back the beating he'd received on the ropes tenfold  it was now Frazier who ended the round with his back against the ropes Dundee watching from the corner noticed how easy had been for Ali to move Frazier around he wondered just how much strength he had left to make matters worse for Frazier his eyes were beginning to swell from all the punishment he'd taken throughout the fight in the 12th he looked to pay Ali back gritting his teeth against three hard blows he managed to press the champion up against the ropes and unload on him almost immediately but Frazier had finally slowed enough for Ali to get in his rhythm Landing eight out of nine blazing fast punches before deflecting Frazier's returned fire Frazier had kept up a breakneck pace for the last 12 rounds he was like a marathon runner maintaining a steady pace for miles but gradually weakening Ali was more like a sprinter taking long breaks between activity and then unleashing all the power he had saved up in short powerful bursts there were upsides and downsides to both strategies Ali was under constant pressure and taking consistent punishment but unlike Frazier who was able to store up strength and pick his spots and so Frazier had softened enough by the 12th for Ali to push him away if only momentarily he only had a moment before Frazier reclosed the distance and filled the gap but a moment was enough while Ali's long arms did not allow for much power at close range his punches still torn to Frazier's face exacerbating the swelling and his already damaged eyes Ali danced away near the end of the round trying to make Frazier believe that he was still fresh but the truth was while it was Frazier who had appeared too slow it was Ali who was beyond exhaustion in his corner Frazier informed Futch that his eyes had gotten worse he's spent the last half of the round fighting in a kind of hates barely able to make out Ali's punches as they barreled towards his head thinking on his feet fudge came up with a plan in his own words so I told Frazier to stay back about eight inches and made him stand up a little straighter Futch figured that from further back Frazier would at least have time to see the punches coming across the ring Ali's head drooped forward the champion now tired in a way he had never experienced before he felt as though any second he may bomb it or pass out but Dundee had sensed an opportunity and screamed at Ali look at him he ain't got no power left go get him Elliott sensed it too he dug deep and came into the 13th looking for a knockout the two met in the middle of the Ring Ali pestering his rivals eyes with stinging jabs and breaking his own rhythm to lead Frazier into hard crosses far from helping him Frazier's new altered posture left him more open midway through the round Ali slammed a thunderous for a hook into Frazier's jaw once again sending his mouthpiece flying across the ring this time out into the audience sensing the time had finally come Ali threw everything he had left at Frazier landing hard right after hard right giving all he had to put down the man who had once knocked him to the canvas and denied him his victory in the biggest fight of his life never had Ally inflicted so much sustained damage to his rival and Frazier nearly lost his legs from under him more than once I fought him best I could Frazier would later relate I could barely see I was fighting on instinct bobbing and weaving clay was timing me but Frazier refused to fall to quote Ali for the third time Joe Frazier surprised me with his stamina his relentlessness and the gunpowder in his blows I opened his lip and closed his eyes but he still kept coming forcing me onto the ropes making me deliver power when I didn't even know if it was still there although he had nearly been knocked out twice in the round Frazier was still able to throw bombs somehow still standing still fighting Frazier punctuated the round with a thunderous left hook the bell in  Frazier's corner coach Eddie Futch had a difficult decision to make Frazier could barely see and had taken a dangerous amount of damage on the other hand Frazier had still gotten tremendous punches through near the end of the round fudge one of the most perceptive coaches and combat sports suspected that Ali was close to done more than anything he knew how much defeating Ali meant to Joe he decided to give Frazier one last round to get the job done in fact he was right Ali already passed his known limits in the 13th was an uncharted territory even he did not know how much he had left to get but in the 14th he gave it all the Bell called both out to face each other for the last time the two circled dead tired the look of a wounded animal in the eyes of both three fights 41 rounds two championships and five years had brought them here they had tested each other in every way possible only to find that even now their skill physicality and willpower were nearly even their bodies failing their will driving them on the fight balanced on a Razors Edge but then just as it seemed as if both men have spent everything they had somehow Ally came to life he threw one last furious assault throwing punches as if he'd just come out for the first but Frazier endured and he was still looking for that one shot Frazier sunk low and hurled himself forward with the last of his strength but this time Ali pulled away Frazier crashed into him and now both of them were far past spent Frazier walked forward his legs giving way hands drooping below his wings Ali's stumbled in between punches pausing and taking big gasping breaths before firing off his hardest shots over and over a look of complete disbelief on his face to quote Ali when someone asked a marathon runner what goes through their mind in the last mile or two he said that you ask yourself why am i doing this you get so tired and takes so much out of you mentally it makes you go a little insane I was thinking that at the end why am I doing this what am i doing in here against this beast of a man it's so painful I must be crazy Frazier marched forward on sheer willpower taking everything that I'll lead through his way and then it was over the round ended and smoked and drove Frazier was still standing through all the rounds and all the fights Ali had never once put him down barely able to see the referee guided Frazier back to his corner as Ali sat down he had a terrifying realization he was not sure how much longer he'd go on of course he didn't know about such his decision all he knew was that Frazier had taken him to his absolute limit to a place that he'd never been before a place he would later call the closest thing to death in Frazier's corner coach Eddie Futch could then witness the fighters die in the ring before had seen enough I'm going to stop it fudge told Frazier you're taking too much punishment Joe protested no don't I wanna boss blind battered beaten Frazier was in no condition to fight it's all over son fudge told him no one will ever forget what you did here today and so the greatest fight in boxing history came to a close Ali could not believe it he stood and raised his hands and victory a moment later he fell to the floor to quote the man himself I was so relieved so tired and has so much pain that my knees buckled and I stretched right out where I was right there in the middle of the ring he had taken 440 hard solid punches from Joe Frazier many throughout the years have romanticized so-called lost round wondering what would have happened if Frazier had been allowed to come out for the 15th but the truth is both men had already given what they had to give both had left a piece of themselves in that ring and for each it was a piece that they would never fully get back perhaps Ali said it best we went to Manila as champions jointly and we came back as old men  thanks for watching I left a list of sources used for all three fights in

like your repair sleeping when her and order t rap my brother", "HvK7aaKlJFE": "[Music]  hi everybody welcome to Aikido flow now you noticed by now I've been a bouncer for what 20 years now okay now I've been attacked in various ways but there's always kind of some sort of a pattern to the way people tend to attack me and it always seems sir there's certain attacks which are more common than other attacks so today we're gonna have a look at this most people that attack you will not be trained okay now when I've been attacked in the past is often being someone who's disgruntled because some reason we haven't let them in a club or we've had to get them from the club or it could just be somebody who's drunk and they're just active City but most people's tax attacks aren't as coordinated you know you know there's certain things ways you can react if somebody's trained to attack you certain ways you can react if someone's not trained so we're gonna just go over some techniques and we're going to look at the most common ways in which people tend to attack you okay now there's the mode one of the most common ones I've been attacked by a lot I've lost count in that time people done this on me is the haymaker at one way you know maybe because I'm a big guy but people I think they just want to just kind of get that one knockout punch I don't want to stand there and go toe-to-toe so they always kind of you know this big punch here boom and they try to come round and they try to get you now that's foolish because that's probably the easiest attack to defend yourself from okay so there's several ways you can okay and it really depends on the scenario as you know I'll be working on the door I've got a lot of people around me okay so let's say I'm the ideal way I would do it is less if something's coming with a haymaker boom I'm moving in okay I'm moving in but it depends on my snare it depends on what's around me if I can move in great because if I can move in then from here back come with an elbow if I don't want to be too harsh on a person chop them here or whatever I come with a tension oggi here and take them down but there's various ways now if I've got more space and depending on let's say it's him and I know his mate is over here or I know it is people lurking behind me that might pretend to be friends of his I want to move the other way so there's another way I will absorb oh and I can move this way now from here that's what I can do you know I could come here and do it see and argue here take him down here or you know I could just you know I come here and I could then I can come into attention argue or something but there's a lot I could do from that scenario but that's more absorbing rather than moving in but it's such a easy thing to predict to see coming or if you really want to be nice you don't want to really hurt now when I say come in he's moving and just say whoa you know say calm yourself down give them a kiss if it's a girl and then we move on you know you don't really have to disable the person you don't have to hurt the person but it's a great way just to defuse that attack okay now another way people want to attack you okay is if they're armed with a bottle or a stick or something they want to hit you with now most likely they go for the head they always go for the head because the aim is to knock you out and they're gonna heat with a bottle across your chest you know they'll go for your head so often what it is the bottle comes vertically down on your head boom blades want to smack you on your head now it helps if you're aware I carry me on the door I always tend to stand like this and I always watch the person look at their body language so if they want to come here on my head my aim is to move from here there's so much I can do come with it in at menarche here or take him down here or if I'm quick enough and I move in underneath here I can just come here and then come here grab and in a throw here over my shoulder we take him down he's gonna come over hand on his head for me in this situation okay he's armed so for me I'm not holding back you know I'm gonna I'm not gonna try and block and give him a snap on his wrist I'm gonna take him down because now he's armed if I really hurt him I don't know I might get arrested but at least I can justify it say had a bottle in his hand he went to hit me over my head with it which could potentially have killed me so in that scenario you just go all out okay now the next common attack okay is a kick boom often people either try and do like a frontal kick here or kick to the groin now with me someone's kicked me in my groin I understand there and take it watch them break all their toes but for you the average person here's what you need to do okay so they're gonna come in okay and they're kind of trying to do like a straight fun to kick boom PA me on my groin or maybe to my solar pets or something whatever what I need to do is move slightly to the side and as he comes in I'm blocking here look at where he is boom nice tension argue here I just block it here and just move in tension Aggie take him down that's a great way of taking somebody down okay now the next one which I've forgotten  yes I go for okay next one second form in it menarche okay now in the dojo this sad we do it kiss it I'm gonna kick boomer coming here here and that big circle here and I'm taking them down here okay on the street you ain't messing around with that it's here comes here bang crack nice elbow ball straight to the jaw keep following it through and then you take him down whatever they'll take a bell you know you've got them here or whatever you know you know you cause what you can do from there but it's just that initial movement coming in here boom the most important bit here is here okay the blocking here I need to move its ever so slight see I don't have to move far even if he still grazes me it's not the impact he wanted to get me here on my groin or in my solar plexus it's just ever so slight movement what I've avoided that impact form where now I'm in a good position to take down ok another snare I'm in all the time okay someone's in your face you know they're pushing you you know say it pushing you and often that push it off on these up to a grab boom because they're trying to deceive you you know it's kind of like a little like push you know whatever make bla bla bla the next one your hand comes out you think it's gonna be a little shot but then it's to grab because their aim is to draw you in and bang they don't want you to move they're only to dodge that because like I say normal streets wants to stand there and spar for 10 minutes they just want to just take you down so so let's say someone comes up and they grab okay and graph and so basically what I'm gonna do is as soon as they grab okay hopefully with my reflexes are quick enough they grab oh I'm elbow in him okay if that doesn't work okay this elbow becomes a block then I'm coming here and I'm doing here and Nikia here and I'm just getting that little lock there on the wrist lock here and I'm taking him down I'm potentially really hurting his wrist okay or same thing he goes through a grab okay I've blocked here and let's say he's got a mate which is behind me then I turn I want to do here I want to do an e key oh so now I've turned now I'm facing his mate here who was potentially behind him was pretend to avenge to meet and now I've got him in a position where I want to be him from here I could even run this way I could take him all the way down make his head hit the ground and then if his mate wants to come who wants to come at least I'm in a position where I'm ready next technique a headlock people always want to get you in a headlock because when they when you've got someone headlock you feel safe because you got the position where they can't really punch you they can't kick you so you're holding them this person's like you know just freaking themselves around trying to get out but you need to know how to get out and that's just a common attack people do they'll often just jump on you and try to get you in some sort of headlock so let's say the person jumped on you and they've got you they got you in a headlock here now I'm in a situation here but what's exposed look at that there's a boom you know nice hit to his groin or whatever from here I'm coming up here I'm going for this hand here now my aim here is to basically turn my whole body here mmm I got a knife Sankyo here here I've got his wrist the nice lock I could turn it I could really inflict some serious pain and really hurt him if I really want it I can continue it here and take him down or take it out here break this kick him or whatever you know there's so much I can do from there you know or if need be if it's my hands you've learned on the other hand here I same way my strike here I'm turning my body here and I'm going here for an akio here again I'm taking him down okay and I got good position there lock my arm so even if it tries to get up he's not getting up because my arm here is locked okay if I'm up here mom has been he can get up and he can actually still do some damage turn over lock my arm keep him down there and you've got him done you're at a head lock it's all done and dusted so in conclusion there's various ways people will attack now this is this video is for people who were not trained if someone's trained you know there's all sorts of ways they might attack you know some of my combat around house or you know series of Wing Chun punches or whatever but the majority I've been attacked is been no specific ways and as long as you do a bit of training and you're alert and you're paying attention you'll always be able to get out of here okay and just to let you know our dojo is now moved we're now in the mobile eSports centre okay that's in like Kilburn area Queens Park area near Queens Park station near Ken's of white station check the link below you'll find all these are the address we train every Monday 6 o'clock come down have some fun and we'll see you there take care [Music] Oh  [Music] you", "CEkhCOCi7OY": "[Music]  awesome so we're gonna try something with the Rubik's Cube we're gonna mix it up on all six sides now there's 43 quintillion different ways you can mix it up so watch that close completely mix it up one-handed in the bag as fully as possible back to solve I think you have a guess on how I do that right some people guess who the second cube in the bag I will prove the bag is empty look I'll check completely empty completely empty  [Applause] Fineman I'm gonna do something that's never been done before on TV Simon can you actually mix up that Rubik's you turn as much as you want now every time you turn it it's a different one of those 43 quintillion permutations Simon whenever you're happy I will take the cube that you just mixed up and put it back and beg watch that close Simon's mixed-up rubik's cube [Music] laughs inside of it that would be an amazing trick in there was not a second Rubik's cube in the back but that's not the trick I'm being a - you're still paying attention Simon can you actually cover it up on all six sides cover it up perfect like that yeah now when you think of a solved Rubik's Cube what do you actually picture solids colors right what if I told you that I found a different solution to the Rubik's Cube watch close [Music] right about right about there see the different solution was to match the Rubik's Cube that Simon mixed up 30 seconds ago you have so if I did match it you're gonna notice we have one side that's going to be a completely  better than one side though that's going to be side number two that is 3 that is 4 that is 5 that is all six I'd to complete  you  here's the deal I love this so here's that here's a paperclip you're gonna do me a huge favor all I want you to do is say stop stop okay I'm gonna cut the cards whatever this is we're not gonna look at it this gets folded up and it gets placed in this paper clip right here Mel B this is gonna go in front of you when I was a kid I was fascinated by counting cards this isn't a hundred percent but hopefully you're gonna notice a pattern here we're gonna shoot one out and hopefully it'll look from there look see there's an ace I tell you what all I need to do is pull it out yeah you're a pull cord out so you're gonna reach in there and just pull it out you got it yeah oh yeah if Sherwood with its watch watch this gonna be sick it's gonna be a - okay watch the eight it's a shake watch the eight see it's a shake and we can get the two out see what I mean see we did that you don't say the number one trick by a comedy magician is pulled out of here so look there's a three hopefully we can shoot one out of the center look there's a four right there so Mel all I need you to do is just yell out stop watch riffle go stop okay take that card right there if that's the five that's sick check it out and see if we got it  [Applause] so right now I think the six is thirty eight cards from the top so we're gonna tell a sheet one out here boom look look there's a six Simon do me a favor if you watch the tenth here we can just cover it see there's the seventh how are you ready I am ready okay stop stop okay we need the eight what do we got what do we got short writer we need the eight for the crown  [Applause] part of my pocket before we started see there's the nine right there now watch we're gonna cut these up like this and hopefully we can find the 10 the Jack the Queen and the king god [Applause]  so Simon do me a favor think of any card you want to don't name it out loud yet okay it's gonna be disabled you got it yeah watch this we're gonna shuffle these up Simon name the card you're thinking of right now three a club three of clubs I did this because I thought I would go through here and not just shuffle all the cards but take all of them and shuffle all those clubs back in order like that [Music] how'd you set hearts I said what the heck why don't we shuffle all the hearts in order had you said spades we would have ax you shuffle all the spades in order just like that [Applause] before we started we folded a card we put in a paperclip we didn't look at it  the cards you thought of the three close  [Applause]  for 52 cards in a deck as everybody knows so you guys have lots of choices to choose from I'm gonna use some rubber bands just to wrap them up because Howard if it's okay I'm gonna toss this deck out to you the rubber bands will keep it from going all over the place when you catch them I'm gonna snap my fingers and when you hear the snap I want you to just break open the pack and look at a car didn't remember it and then you'll pass the deck to Heidi I'll snap same thing all the way down and then how we all ask you to toss the deck back to me Howard are you ready sir excellent card one card only Heidi if you would pass it to mr. Buble MLB one card one card only excellent Howie  perfect and just toss the cards back to me  it's alright the idea of this is that I don't want to touch the cards so here's what I like each of you guys to do is please hold up your hand high and imagine that on the palm of your hand is the card that you picked okay I'm gonna name five cards if I name your card just drop your hand  [Music]  five of clubs two of hearts eight at diamonds ten of clubs Jack spades [Applause]  you  come and join you you'll take would that be okay I'd like to share with you a trick he uses a 50-pound note one of the largest currency notes available in this country with my sleeves rolled up guys with nothing in my hands we can get a show this on the screen I'm gonna change this 50 pound no into the much rarer infinitely more valuable Bank of Britain's Got Talent you can see we've got we got our head of state mr. Simon Cowell we've got our beautiful princesses of course our queen and son for you to keep don't spend all at once guys I don't want you to feel left out so I brought along some more cash for you but I know I know deep down you don't really want one of these you'd much rather have one of those Bank of Britain's Got Talent  what thought I'd finish with a trick using a picture that I've drawn it's a self-portrait that's me this is where we are Britain's Got Talent you see most magicians at this point would ask one of you to reach in and take a card I'm not going to do that instead if I may I'm just going to ask each of you one question David if I may start with you if I could ask you to choose a color red or black whatever you say is what we will use what color would you like black Alicia

and gentlemen good afternoon to you what an absolute pleasure to be here quick question who here owns a Ferrari seriously not a single one a couple of weeks ago I saw something that you don't see every single day it was an accident between a Ferrari and a VW Golf by the time that I arrived the VW Golf was on one side of the road and it was a little shorter than it was meant to be originally and on the other side of the road was this what used to be a six foot three gleaming red Ferrari but was now a four foot two slightly more crunchy Ferrari and you drive past that and you think to yourself that's a really bad day for some wealthy individual and it's not something you see every day so I pulled my car over I put a little fit a comment on Facebook and I said let's have a moment of silence for the mighty fallen never again to go from nought to a hundred in six point three or three point six seconds and the reaction that I got from some of my friends on Facebook was interesting people said they didn't say things like what a shame what a pity our what a loss they said serves him right and the hatred just kept on coming one comment after another how can he drive a car like that in a country like this our roads are wrong for it he was probably drunk one person stopped just short of accusing him of being a child molester and it was fascinating to me just to see the level of hatred aimed at this Ferrari driver now here's the interesting bit about it the only information that I put on Facebook was there has been an accident between a golf and a Ferrari that's it we don't know who was wrong we don't know if it was the golf driver who made the mistake we don't know if a dog didn't run across the road and caused this thing but what was interesting is it showed up a belief system that most of us don't even know we have it's a bias against the rich it's fascinating now in a room like this we are all studying and working toward building careers building futures becoming high net-worth individuals let me ask you a question do you reckon you can become a high net worth individual at the same time as hating wealthy people it's a self-limiting belief and it actually gets in the way but what's fascinating is that the kind of thinking that is handed down to us from generation to generation is invisible it was once beautiful wasn't it and I'm not the only person who's actually seen this in motion anybody here watch Top Gear yes yeah absolutely Top Gear fans join me for a moment here the rest of you can just go to sleep Jeremy Clarkson says in the United States you watch a person drive by in a Bentley and the reaction is one day I'll be in one of those and he says it's different in Britain he says in Britain you watch a guy drive past in the Bentley and you say one day I'll have him out of that that's a bit more sinister isn't it a little bit darker and it's really interesting because particularly in South Africa we have spent decades trying to unravel a belief system about racism that's been handed down from generation to generation but we are not aware of other beliefs that are handed down to us particularly beliefs about wealthy people and here we all are chasing these goals and chasing these lives while at the same time feeling uncomfortable about talking about money or talking about wealthy people as though they are obviously evil they come from the devil let's take a look at how this thinking is created how its generated how its handed down from generation to generation and how it can stop you from achieving your goals the point is to unravel it get it out of our minds X I sit be rid of it be free of it so that we can actually chase the goals that we have in life and become all God intended us to be in my family if you go back two generations to my grandmother she used to work at an English manor house in Manchester is anyone here ever watched the show on TV quite a quite amateur show called Downton Abbey anyone seen it no okay the basic idea is you've got two sets of people you've got the higher class folks who own this Abbey they're kind of semi royalty in the in the United Kingdom then you've got the people downstairs who run everything they do the cooking they do the sweeping the cleaning it's the the staff my grandmother was part of the manor house but she was not the people upstairs she was the people downstairs she was one of the maid servants who helped to keep this manor house clean and if you have to see pictures of the way that they dressed at the time it was the full old-style regalia she had the little apron and the little maids outfit and the little feather duster and it's everything we think of a slightly kinky today but of course at the time it was nothing like that this was a woman who worked incredibly hard from dusk till dawn this was a woman whose back was sawed more often than not this was a woman who if you ever met her and put your hands on her hands you'd find nothing but calluses and most importantly this was a woman who had no voice in the face of authority because the thinking back then for both the lower classes and for women was keep quiet don't make waves be a cog in the system we don't want to know that you exist we just want to see that your job gets done and this is the kind of thinking that is then handed down from generation to generation and what's interesting is that when my dad came along my grandmother was looking for the best advice she could possibly give to him about work and wealth and how to make your way in the world she went rummaging around in her mind and she came up with this Jim and it was the advice she gave to my dad she said my son get a trade that way you will never starve to death who here has heard some variation of that advice yeah yeah a lot of us have heard things down those lines there's nothing wrong with getting a trade you can become a plumber and you can become very wealthy as a plumber but listen to the second half of that sentence did she say so that you can become all god intends you to be is it so that you can let your light shine so that you can become wealthy so that you can achieve goals no it's so that you never starve to death the thinking comes from a place of desperation and that's the thinking that's handed down generation to generation and the weird part is it's completely invisible to us we hear this advice and we think it's right and we think it's normal now I'm not picking on my grandmother she was doing the best she could with the ideas that she had without perhaps knowing how much damage it can do to future generations take a look at the building you see behind me there that is an Industrial Revolution era factory it's about a hundred maybe 120 years ago what other building that we have today looks very similar to that factory out loud what do you think  hospitals what else schools schools yeah schools and here's an interesting one r-run according to the Industrial Revolution age of thinking picture this for a second you drop your kids off at school or you as a child or dropped off at school and you line up in neat lines and the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle or rings the bell and in your neat lines you go to your workstation and you sit down you sit down at your little workstation and you work for a number of hours and then the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle rings the bell and you take out your little lunch box and you can have some food then the whistle goes again you go back into your work station you sit down it is run according to an industrial revolution era Factory why because we are training human beings to be cogs in a system and we're still doing it hey now I'm not picking on schools here the point is not to say that schools are badly run the point is just to say we have thinking that is invisible to us we are trained to thought and we are culture alized to act in certain ways that no longer make sense in the modern economy the old world thinking says become a cog in a system fit in don't make waves and if you're a perfect cog you'll get you a little bit of money at the end of the day and you can go home that thinking will keep you poor so what are some of the alternatives well that's what I'd like to look at with you here today I like to call that style of thinking the wheelbarrow way it basically goes like this it's like the parents get hold of their child the young son the young daughter they say my son my daughter you are young and strong you must go out into the world and earn coins here's how you do it pick up your wheelbarrow load it full of bricks and for every hour that you push your wheelbarrow you will get one coin if you want a second coin you have to push your wheelbarrow for a second hour now we think like that we go the only way to earn coins is to work for a set number of hours so let me go and get a job and be dead on a boss now you work your set number of hours every day you push your wheelbarrow for your set number of hours and a horrible thing starts to happen you start to realize that you can't quite afford the car you're not quite breaking even with the kids and their education and the debit orders and the bonds and so on so what do you do you go back to the thinking that was handed down to you and you say if I'm not getting enough coins what do I have to do I have to push a second wheelbarrow in the evenings to get more coins that kind of thinking keeps families in generational cycles of poverty if you take nothing else away from today this is the one principle that is the most important do not tie your earning to the number of hours you work you've got to separate those two and I'll show you how today but so long as we think a number of hours equals a number of coins we are in financial trouble because as a human being you only have so many hours in the day the wealthy person's epiphany the way of breaking out of this idea is this dump the bricks in your wheelbarrow get rid of them load your wheelbarrow up with gold in other words for every hour that you push that wheelbarrow you need to raise the value of your work earn more coins per hour not work more hours in order to get more coins so that make sense okay of course that raises some interesting questions are how the heck do you do that there are definitely ways of doing it what are some of the things that our families teach us about work and about wealth and about how economies work and once again it's not to say that they are trying to do damage in our lives they are doing the best they can with the thinking handed down to them but the world has changed what are some of the things that they teach us work hard there's nothing wrong with working hard I believe in working hard but the goal is actually to make money not to work hard and there is a very big difference there in certain companies people think you are fantastic if you are working hard not necessarily if you are being effective so what they do is people make a show of the number of hours that they work how they work over weekend how they part of every meeting they're not necessarily getting stuff done but they're showing that they're working hard yeah that's the difference the next thing is play it safe play it safe wealthy people take risks all the time the middle classes and poor folks take no risks at all in fact I heard a phrase the other day that's just been resonating in my mind that says the middle classes are paralyzed by doubt they are secure to the point of paralysis they do not take risks and of course the thinking handed down there is get a safe job and let someone else take care of you be like everyone else here's an obvious thing that has to be said if you be like everyone else you're gonna earn like everyone else if you choose the safe route in life you are choosing to earn less than you potentially could so today let's talk about the idea of recession versus abundance you've probably heard I mean it's all over the world news and it's in every newspaper every blog everywhere you go the recession that we've been talking about that kicked in in 2008 what's interesting about recessions is not what's going on in the world what's going on in your Innerspace up here there are for example speakers in my industry who have decided that there is a recession and have earned a heck of a lot less as a result then there are other speakers was a gibe particular guy in the states named randy gage who said in 2008 the world issued an invitation to go into recession and I politely declined and he says he's had his best year ever every single year since then because what happens is when we are told that there is a recession we stop acting in ways that generate money because we believe that people aren't buying we haven't discovered a recession we have bought into the concept of a recession there are certain companies who have had their best years ever since right the way through this recession because they simply don't believe in it today I'd like to share with you a tip eight ideas eight ways of overhauling your thinking that have to do with work and wealth and my promise to you is that they are going to be uncomfortable I hear to make people feel good but this stuff is massively important it's important because we are still being taught the ways to work that are outdated the world changes but we're still practicing the old ways if you do do the Twitter thing you're more than welcome to tweet about it as you go along I see a couple of people grabbing their phones when you see the eight yeah if you want to connect with me on Twitter use at Douglas Kruger yeah you can say this guy is talking a load of rubbish or this is a valuable idea whatever but I warn you I'm going to close the doors and check every tweet before I let you out I will find you epiphany number one resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy there's a phrase that my family always used to use and when I was young we struggled really really badly with poverty we had some incredibly rough winters one that I remember we went through the whole of July with our power cut off we had our local church bringing food baskets to our house and I lived in a pretty decent neighborhood and we were the odd ones out so it's quite rough to go through that sort of thing and to have someone else feeding your family when your own parents can't it was a difficult time to go through but what's most interesting to me now looking back on that time period is the kind of language that my family used around the dinner table has your family ever used a phrase like how the other half live when they talk about rich people yeah you know what it's like it's like rich people are a different species the way that I'd like you to look at the difference between where you are and wealth is I want you to look at it as a curve because if it is a curve you can move along that curve you can go from where you are now to your goals but if you buy into that thinking that says rich people are just a different species then instead of a curve there's just a chasm there's a hole there is an absolute void between where you are and where you to be and if you don't believe that it's possible to move along that transition you don't act in ways that start to move you there the first the starting point in becoming a high net worth individual is the belief that it is possible that a wealthy person is not a different species they're just further along on a continuum they have more education about what brings in money and how to achieve goals than what you currently have and that's okay because that represents hope that means you can learn these things you can do them resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy we often think about wealthy people as they're obviously evil they're obviously corrupt they obviously stepped on people's faces to get where they are now Forbes magazine paints a different picture of that they take the highest-earning individuals on the planet and they look at how much they give the stats bear out that wealthy people give more per capita than anyone else we're not just talking about more money because they actually have more we're talking about more per individual in percentage form the idea that wealth people are wealthy people are obviously stingy obviously evil is not borne out by statistics yeah of course there's obviously the odd jerk you will meet the odd horrible rich person they're out there certainly in their numbers but by and large it is not a valid rule that's number one number two there are three things that money is not money is not the root of all evil that's not what the verse says what does the verse say the love of money and it also doesn't say is the root of all evil it says something down the lines of is the root of many kinds of evil now think about what that belief would do to Christian families people of faith if it becomes a locked-in belief and it's handed down generation to generation money is the root of all evil okay so if I chase it there's something wrong with me you can't hold that belief and become wealthy the two do not work together and that's one of those things that we need to check out it's a misquote of the original verse and it's damaging it does a lot of harm particularly to people of faith money is the first thing money is not the root of all evil the second thing money is not embarrassing could you be rich with a straight face time to face that question because you are on a career trajectory that can potentially make you very wealthy could you handle it what kind of human being would you be once you get there yeah wealth simply makes you an amplified version of yourself so what are you if you're a horrible person a rich version of you is going to be a horrible person who's able to do more if you're a good person who likes to help others a rich version of you will be an amplified version of that their money is not embarrassing and if we are embarrassed by money it changes a number of things around the dinner table as a family we won't talk about it no no the middle classes like to talk about how hard we're working but we never talked about how to earn money or how to lose money all of the rules of money you get into the home of wealthy people and that's what they talk to their children about because they think it's important money is not embarrassing we must talk about it and number three you'll see that little pool on the screen their money is not finite it is not finite it is not a limited resource if I take some over here there's less for you money doesn't work that way I have a friend who studied to be a doctor she actually qualified no in fact forgive me I got that one wrong she is a qualified lawyer passed her bar exam and what she then did because she was married to a guy who is quite wealthy she said I'm not going to practice law because if I practice law I get a salary and that means slightly less money for other people folks the thinking is wrong she has the world's best intentions there but what she's actually doing is failing to contribute a little bit to the total amount of money available work doesn't take money out of a system it adds it to it the more people we have running their own businesses the more people we have selling the more people we have doing stuff the more there is for all bring your skill to this country bring your talent earn money for yourself the more you have the more there is in totality it's also very interesting because in different countries they think about the finite nature of money in different ways Korea about 10 20 years ago they decided that they wanted to do economic upliftment for the majority of their people so what did they do they took a look at America and they said I reckon we contact we can take on their car industry and we can take on their IT industry have you ever heard of Samsung yeah have you ever heard of any of the Korean car brands yeah Hyundai and what's the other one Kia and they are absolutely conquering the world right now because what they've decided to do is to grow now other countries around the world and in fact South Africa is a prime example we go oh there's a finite amount of money so if we want to make some people rich what are we going to do if we're going to take from others rather than growing the entire pool bring your skill grow the country we need entrepreneurs we often talk about how much we need jobs you can't falsely create a job my next question to you is why the heck would you want a job you can't get wealthy in a job but that's what we're taught as middle-class people we're taught be like everyone else get a good safe job ok we'll talk about that one in just a moment as well number three represent yourself represent yourself there's a fantastic book and when I'm king of the world I'm going to make it mandatory reading for everyone it's called outliers by Malcolm Gladwell anyone here read that yeah I highly recommended Malcolm Gladwell outliers he talks about the difference between people who fail and succeed in anything and he talks about how in wealthy families they teach their children something very different to what is taught in middle class and poorer families and it's just how to interact with Authority the middle classes and poorer people are taught to fear Authority and it's industrial revolution thinking you've got to fear the guy who runs the factory because he owns your life yeah and it goes like this let's take a practical example they do this one in the book he says you're taking your child to the dentist the middle-class family will teach the child that the dentist is God he has studied for eight years and he knows everything there is to know you as the child must shut up sit down keep quiet and even if it hurts don't cry just wait for it to be over do whatever he tells you to do now in wealthy families they approach the exact same situation completely differently driving to the dentist's office they tell the child the dentist is your friend he has studied for eight years so that he can serve you properly how's that Hey the dentist is a resource that you can use if you have any questions about your mouth about your teeth about anything that you want to know there you must ask the dentist because it's his job to help you now take that kind of thinking that's a simple example going to the dentist take that kind of thinking and amplify it over the next 20 years which of those two kids is going to do well in life you've got one who's taught to fear Authority shut up keep your voice down don't make waves and the other one who's taught the world is there for you to utilize it's all resources you can use it to your own ends imagine the difference that that would make represent yourself and we need to teach our children to represent themselves as well we have been conned into an industrial revolution myth that says authorities in charge and knows best you must shut up and do what you're told you must be a cog in a system and as long as you are doing your job perfectly and not making waves you'll be fine that thinking is a hundred years outdated we cannot teach it any longer number three number four inspired ideas this is one of my favorites as you go about building your career there are the things that you need to do on a day to day basis that slowly gradually move you up that curve toward wealth and if you keep doing them slowly and consistently and gradually every single day ultimately your life is going to improve and you must do those things however from time to time we get that one inspired idea that crazy thought that thing that pops into our heads are we go what if and it's those ideas which in one go can add an extra zero to your income you must have them you must act on them I'll give you a simple practical example in 2006 I had a book published on public speaking and it went through a traditional publisher in Cape Town it went into the bookstores and sold for about a hundred and fifty R and a book of which I got a trans 75 that's how much the author actually gets still I was really chuffed to have this book published and it's a bit of credibility for me as a speaker and it did bring in some money now one of my professional speaker friends said Doug don't do it that way the next time you write a book publish it yourself you pay for the printing you pay for everything and sure it's a bit of money up front but after that you can sell the book at a complete profit and I had this inspired idea I thought wait a minute what if you took that one step further what if you got somebody else to pay for the book so I literally walked in the front door of one of my biggest clients old mutual fair Bain Capital and I spoke to one of the directors and I said how do you feel about giving me a hundred and fifty thousand Rand two minutes later after he'd said yes we were discussing his next yachting holiday I took the chance I tried and it worked he paid for a thousand copies of two separate books and I've been selling them ever since no money down every book that I sell is pure profit margin hey you're starting to see how like thinking differently means different levels of income you can get a salary at the end of the month or you can do things for yourself and generate your own income with inspired ideas now that's just a small one but that brought in firstly it meant I didn't have to pay a hundred and fifty thousand rand and then beyond that it meant something like three four four five hundred thousand rands worth of book sales over the years and that's just one small thing that made a massive impact on my life but I had to represent myself I had to have the idea I had to walk through the door and just have the gumption to try to ask to not be a cog in a system that just does its function perfectly to be a human being with a face and a voice and thoughts creative ideas and an opinion and that can change the scale of your income that's number four number five number five is an abstract idea leaving the ranks of the poor may mean leaving the ranks of the poor that makes sense get will in a moment a while ago I was driving past a particularly poor area it was one of these places where on the side of the road you see these dogs with the sort of ribs sticking out and I mean it's all dust and poverty and hardship and you know I look at that sort of thing in it it saddens me that human beings still have to live under conditions like that here you think about it as a species we're at the level where we're each of us I mean how many people around the room are holding personal computers in their own hands in the form of an own or an iPad or whatever the case might be we have that kind of technology we send satellites out into space we are able to take a photograph of Earth from millions of miles away and then send it back through the void and look at that picture we have astonishing levels of achievement and yet we still have families who don't have enough to eat every day that's awful now dry I happen to be on my way to a conference where I was speaking about an entrepreneurial idea how to make money and I thought to myself just a mental exercise if I was stripped of all of the stuff that I use every day the suit the car the equipment the bits and pieces there the toys if I was stripped of all of that and just left with my knowledge my wits and my education and put into this scenario living in abject poverty could I get back out could I get back out and back to my own life what do you think and could you yeah okay most of the people around this room are kind of saying yes now that's an interesting thought let's take that thought one step further if I had to take a high net worth individual someone who does Drive the Ferrari the Lamborghini someone with their own private helicopter with their own business whatever the case might be and I transplanted them into your life do you think they would be able to get back out if we say yes to that then what we're saying is the gap between where you are and where that person is is up here and then a horrifying thought but at the same time it represents hope because it means it can be done it means that the thought is out there the ideas are out there the knowledge the education is available it can be done leaving the ranks of the poor however may mean leaving the ranks of the poor my thought process went like this I thought maybe I'd start up a small company something that doesn't doesn't require a lot of startup capital maybe a little store maybe I'd get other people to work for me and then I kind of stopped enough so I thought to myself that's not what I do the first thing I do is to physically leave and go somewhere else why because often in situations like that the thinking is depressed and it's not it's not to point fingers or to point blame I mean I've been in a family that has gone through extreme poverty but when you've had generations of poverty it's almost impossible to believe it's possible the thinking becomes depressed there's a speaker in the States these days who has an interesting concept and I believe it he says you are likely to be about as wealthy and about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you think about that for a second who are your closest five it's likely to be probably something like mom dad best friend boss teacher something down those lines chances are it's those people how wealthy are they I'm sorry to ask the question but apparently those stats bear out because what happens is we get involved in an ecosystem of thinking and we all affect one another with our level of aspiration a level of ideas our thinking about work and wealth and we all Everage each other out there's something you can do about this one you don't have to dump your mom okay you don't have to dump the best friend anything down those lines what it is saying is we do need to associate with highly successful individuals we need to expose ourselves to that kind of thinking unless we do we are not going to lift ourselves up but the thinking is out there and quite often people are quite willing to be mentors friends to share answers share ideas sometimes they're not it's always worth asking worth the approach you are likely to be about as wealthy or about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you here's an uncomfortable question is your state's thinking keeping you put can you think of one policy just one then we have in this country that tries to help people but actually promotes poverty anyone social grants yeah think about it this way around what a great idea you've got a young mom who falls pregnant has a couple of kids she's on her own she has no way of earning an income so what we do we give us some money brilliant idea except then of course the opposite happens you have a young woman who goes you know what I'd like some money some money so I'm going to become a young mom in order to get it there is that likely to help them to become incredibly prosperous no is your state's thinking keeping you poor number six your positioning determines your pay scale it is not the quality of your work that determines your income you can be the best in the world at a certain thing and be out earned by someone who is not the best in the world your positioning determines your pay scale let's put this in very simple terms if you're the celebrity of your industry you're going to out-earn the non celebrity of your industry even if that guy's better at it than you let's take for example anyone here watch the cooking show with Nigella Lawson seen her on TV yeah yeah absolutely Nigella Lawson do you reckon she is one of the top five chefs in the world no I don't think so do you think she's in the top hundred mmm I don't think so do you reckon she's in the top thousand I don't think so so why is she out earning all of them because she's Nigella Lawson I'll give you another example if an unknown speaker comes and stands in front of you that person can put in an invoice fourth X number of zeros at the end of an hour of speaking Richard Branson walks into the room and chats with you for five minutes they will add three more zeros to his fee it's not because he worked harder and it's not because he's a better speaker it's because he's Richard Branson you need to be the icon the expert the celebrity the big name in your industry now here's where most people get it wrong they say knowledge is everything knowledge is important but you also have to bring personality that's what Nigella Lawson is doing she is able to speak well in front of a camera she's pretty she's seductive yeah now this is all the stuff that we are never taught as important we are taught what's important is be a cog in a system don't make waves function perfectly get your job done imagine if Nigella Lawson did that she'd be poor all she'd ever do is cook in the kitchen maybe earn like five bucks once in a while yeah but because she brings humanity to it she brings to it things that cannot be done by a computer that cannot be done by a system anything that can be systematized computerised commoditized is unvalued all we're still teaching our kids to study IT that's a low income future because there's like two billion other people studying IT and most of it will be done by the computer itself like tomorrow that's how fast it's moving there's at one of those talks on Ted the inspirational talks website where a guy says and this is quite interesting he says the economy of tomorrow will not be ruled by people who have doctorates or who have studied IT or anything technical the economy of tomorrow will be ruled by people who did bas and know how to think creatively because the computer can't do that it's the people who bring their personality their humanity you become an icon in their industry so it's not just about how good you are technically at what you do it's about being the human being to face the voice the one we see in the media in magazines hear on the radio are you an icon that way you earn more number seven this one's more for companies but it's useful to us as well don't fixate on the bottom line what most companies tend to do is when they think about their finances they put 80 percent of their energy into saving what they have and 20 percent of their energy into earning more we need to reverse that saving of course is important yes you can save yourself rich if you've got like 150 years to live what's more important is actually generating more income picture a clan of people now I want you to just use your imaginations here let's go back thousands of years in time we're sitting at the outskirts of our cave we are a plan and we're facing winter winter is like recession winter is trying winter is deadly to us and our economy is made up of Buffalo we eat them to survive we wear their coats in order to survive this horrific winter the hunters have been out into the field and good news they came back with three Buffalo but three Buffalo is not quite enough for our entire clan to make it through the winter we technically need more now the thinking in the clan splits in two we get the hunters and we get the bean-counter in the cave and the bean-counter says what we have to do is take those three Buffalo and conserve them preserve them make them last save them so that we get through the winter the hunters see it differently they say no no give us one of the Buffalo to eat and using that strength we will go back out into the field and we will get more Buffalo so that we can make it through the winter all big organizations have this split between the bean-counter and the Buffalo and sometimes it destroys entire companies yeah my belief system says this it doesn't matter how well you save your Buffalo if you don't have enough Buffalo saving effectively is only going to mean you'll starve to death slower you need more Buffalo in the system in other words you need to put 20 percent of your energy into saving your money and 80 percent of your energy into generating more money that's the way we need to think saving is important but it's not all important middle-class thinking says the most important thing to do is save sure if you're going to live for 150 years brilliant idea number eight Randy gage the u.s. speaker recently wrote a book called risky is the new safe the alternative applies safe is the new risky we've been taught for generations to play it safe you get a job and don't make waves I contend that that is the most dangerous thing that you can possibly do because you are taking all of your eggs and putting them in one basket you are taking your life your future your career your spouse your children your medical aids your debit orders your entire life putting them into one basket and handing them to a person whose first concern is not your welfare that sounds pretty dangerous to me also 6070 years ago people did go and get a job and work for 4050 years and retire safely does that happen anymore heck no it's just not the reality most companies these days if you've got a job you have 31 days of safety that's it now let's look at this differently people say being an entrepreneur is risky being your own boss is risky well Forbes magazine says the only people who are wealthy are their own bosses okay the next thing is if you as an entrepreneur try 10 big crazy inspired ideas and eight of them fail you've got two of them working now you go out there and you try another ten big crazy inspired ideas and again eight of them fail two of them work now you're up to four things that are bringing in income you go out there ten big things eight fail two more you're up to six different things that are bringing in income for myself as a speaker I now have multiple income streams I speak I train I sell books I sell DVDs I do media appearances multiple streams of income much much safer risky is the new safe safe is the new risky and the more we buy into the old Industrial Revolution era idea that having a boss take care of us is safe the greater the danger we put our own lives in risky is the new safe safe is the new risky I believe that risk aversion is one of the things that paralyzes most of the people in the middle class your average high net worth individual has been bankrupt three times how scary is the idea of going bankrupt to you yeah to them it's a matter of course they've tried big crazy things they've tried building up businesses and they've uh Turley utterly failed but to them it's only part of the process and they do something interesting and I'd like to invite you to do this they give themselves permission to fail folks today at this early stage in your career make that commitment to yourself do yourself a favor give yourself permission to fail it's okay it's only a bit of embarrassment so any bit of skin off the knees it's only picking yourself up and trying again they think differently in California to what we think here the guy here started and started up a business and failed banks won't touch him with a bargepole in California the banks and the financier seek out the people who have tried and failed before because they reckon that person has learnt valuable lessons along the way give yourself permission to fail here's a revolutionary thought give other people permission to laugh at you and mock you for trying let that be okay say I know my family's not going to understand I know my friends are going to laugh at me they're going to tell me this is crazy you should play it safe and get a job give them permission to think that way give them permission to laugh at you give yourself permission to try and fail you need the space you need the leeway be kind to yourself my final parting thought for today is just this you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you are separated from your goals by a number of actions and that's completely different years years are an abstract concept that's like saying 1020 years from now I'll be wealthy it's not up to years it's up to you and your actions that puts the ball back in your hand that gives you control that gives you the power you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you're separated from your goals by a number of actions the word is as a man thinks so is he so

"", "Bd8_vO5zrjo": "it's been six months since the attack on Pearl Harbor and so far the war has been triumphant for the Empire of Japan they had achieved a string of victories across the Pacific and had captured many research rich territories however Japan still found herself in a difficult position despite all of their successes their biggest opponent the United States had yet to show any signs of surrendering this was worrisome Japan needed to end the war quickly before the US with his mighty industrial strength ultimately defeated him so what Japan needed was to win a decisive battle one that would demoralize the Americans and finally bring them to the negotiating table it was considered that America's centre gravity was as Pacific Fleet primarily its carriers destroyed this and you destroyed their will to continue the war therefore the only chance Japan had a winning this war was if the American carrier fleet was destroyed but the question was how to provoke the carriers from leaving it's safe base at Pearl Harbor the answer attacking objective the Americans wouldn't relinquish without a fight and after much debate it was decided that Midway would be that objective if the Japanese attacked an invading Midway the Americans was certainly responding force and this would finally give the Imperial Japanese Navy a chance to annihilate the American carrier fleet once and for all and thus operation mi was created with the objective of capturing Midway and destroying the Pacific Fleet the Japanese premise their plan on achieving surprise and therefore would have to make the 3,000 mile voyage on radio silence also they were to disperse their forces in order to avoid detection and mask their intentions in conjunction there was another operation to the north to take over the Aleutian Islands which was codenamed Operation Al and so on the early hours of June 4th all the forces were in position to attack a small tiny Atoll in the Central Pacific the stage was set for one of the most epic engagements in naval history this is the Battle of Midway the battle will be told from the Japanese perspective the fog of war will be included during this video that means you the audience member will only know the positions of the Americans the moment the Japanese commander knew of it this is to put the audience member in the commander's seat to see how they would have reacted themselves given the unique circumstances and complex scenarios that plagued the Japanese on the morning of June 4th so to start off let's see who the commander was and what is forces worth spearheading the mi formations were for top of the line fleet carriers of the first mobile striking force also known as the Kido butai this was the most destructive offensive weapon the Japanese Navy had and would be the main protagonists of the upcoming fight its commander is Vice Admiral Nagumo xishi he was 55 and had assumed command of the first air fleet in April of 1941 he didn't get this post because he had a naval aviation experience in fact he has specialized in torpedoes he got the job simply based on seniority it was said his command style lacked decisiveness and that he was too reliant on his staff nevertheless in June of 1942 he was the most experienced carrier commander in the world Nagumo had four carriers with him this day his flagship was the ACOG II the ACOG he was the oldest and longest of all the flat tops she had a large aircraft capacity and since she had been converted from a batterer Cruiser Hall possessed the high speed Chicago was a battleship conversion so this made her the least maneuverable and the slowest of the four but she did embark the most aircraft while typical squadron strength was 18 she herself carried 27 carrier attack planes these two carriers were just solid war horses of the Kido butai they packed a mean punch and were not to be messed around with  next came to two dashing Cavaliers of Cary Division two they were the smaller but more nimble salute class they were designed from the keel up had a good air group size and a very high speed due to their light holes and construction however the downside was that they were lightly armored the so do came first being commissioned in 1937 she was well liked in the Navy her near sister ship the hero was almost identical but had a larger bridge and was slightly better armored real Adam Yamaguchi was a commander of Carrier Division two and he made the hero his flagship he was another high-ranking member of the fleet and was known to be an aggressive hot temper commander compared to Nagumo from the four carriers Nagumo had a combined strength of 248 aircraft 260 total aircraft if one includes the Scout planes from his escorting cruisers what was equally important in the aircraft themselves was the quality of Nagumo's air crews it wasn't a stretch to say that at this point in the war the best naval pilots in the world who were on board these four ships Nagumo's mission was not going to be a walk in the park he essentially had a dual mission one take out Midway he needed to neutralize the base and its aircraft before the invasion convoy arrived two days later and task number two was to keep a lookout for enemy carriers that might appear in the defense of the islands now this was unlikely as the Americans were not expected to react so quickly to the invasion but as a safe measure he was to keep half of his strike force armed with anti shipping weapons in the event the Americans did show up early it has to be mentioned here that there were some ominous signs for the Japanese as mentioned the Japanese were counting on surprise for this bold operation to succeed however on the eve of battle there were signs that this may not be going their way intelligence had revealed suspicious enemy activities around Midway meaning the Americans were more alert than they should have been and second it must be emphasized that the Japanese up to this point have failed to confirm the location of the carriers the Japanese believed they would have to face a two possibly three carriers two therefore so it was imperative that they get a confirmation of their whereabouts it was believed that they would still be in Pearl Harbor during the first days of the operation and there were two attempts to verify this the first was a reconnaissance mission to record her Pearl Harbor however this mission had been canceled but there was still a fallback plan a picket line of submarines ahead of Nagumo's force and so far none of them had reported anything at all this indicated to Nagumo that the American carriers were most likely still import so as far as Nagumo was concerned everything was going as planned  dawn June 4th compared to the scatter cloud cover to the northeast the key to boot I found itself under low but like cumulus clouds the carriers continue to steam into the wind which is coming from the southeast to prepare for the air raid at O 4:30 a strike of 108 aircraft was launched against Midway all of these planes were launched in just 10 minutes a testament to the skill and training of the Japanese pilots leading the strike was lieutenant tomonaga Joey she he was a veteran of the air war over China but this will be his first combat sortie against the Americans Nagumo had to keep the other half of his planes in reserve in case American carriers appeared the pilots in this group were the a-team the best Aikido boat I had to offer akagi's torpedo squadron was said to be the best in the Navy while carry Division two had the reputation of having the best dive bombers any report of an American carrier and these pallets will make easy work of them at the same time of the launch of the Midway Strike Group reconnaissance planes were sent out from the escorting cruisers the search consisted of seven lines six of which stretched out to 300 miles clearly with only seven planes to cover more than a hundred and seventy-six thousand square miles the search effort can be considered half-hearted perhaps even negligent but in the goo Mo's defense it must be reminded that this was a precautionary air search simply put Nagumo and his staff were convinced that no enemy carriers would appear this early into the battle although I would say criticism is justified I mean given the fact that inter reported suspicious activities around Midway and given the bad weather in the area Nagumo should have doubled his search efforts as a safety measure it's what a prudent commander would have done anyway the launch of the search planes went well accepted the launching of float plane number four from the cruiser Tony was delayed for thirty minutes as the military proverb goes no plan survives contact with the enemy and today would be no exception the operation officially began to unravel at oh five thirty two an american catalina pvy was spotted surveying the kedo bousai dam Nagumo had been spotted meaning surprise had been lost this meant that the Americans would be able to get their land-based aircraft airborne before his strike arrived  as predicted the Americans have been able to launch all of its planes before the strike arrived the Bombers went to attack the Japanese carriers only the fighters stayed behind to defend the islands these were 18 obsolete buffaloes and six Wildcats they intercepted the Japanese io6 20 30 miles from the base they never stood a chance with the more agile zeros in the ensuing battle 13 buffaloes and two Wildcats were lost the carrier strike aircraft pushed through and began their bomb runs carried Division two level bombers struck first at OU 634 the dive bombers would come next at o 640 on Easter Island the power plant command posts gasoline lines and miss Hawke were destroyed but damage to the runways was minor on Sand Island the oil tanks were set ablaze and the water lines were hit a seaplane hangar in various base facilities were also destroyed for their effort American fighters and anti-aircraft fire destroyed 11 Japanese planes another 14 will be rendered unserviceable when they landed back on their carriers that's a 23% loss the damage to Midway support facilities had been heavy but the base wasn't out of the fight the Air Group commander lieutenant tomonaga looked back at the condition of Midway and with great dissatisfaction had to report back to Nagumo that a second strike was needed to neutralize the base  what follows next is a series of complicated vents and situations happening to poke the Kido butai and onboard Nagumo's headquarters so I'll tackle them separately starting with the initial air strikes against Aikido butai  @o 710 60 bf Avengers and 4 army b-26s were spotted approaching two Japanese carriers this would be the first of four separate attacks from Midway base aircraft that would harassed him throughout the early morning over 30 fighters were sent to destroyed the ten American warplanes the Avengers selected the hero zero swarmed over them and one by one the torpedo bombers were shot down only two were able to launch at the hero or from extreme range and they missed the four b-26s which had been modified to carry torpedoes went for the acog ii only two were able to launch but they both missed the real danger was posed by the last b-26 the damaged bomber made no attempt to pull out of its attack instead it headed directly for a caucus bridge Nagumo and his staff saw this and were shocked the Americans were not supposed to show this kind of bravery the bomber pressed on and at last minute narrowly missed the bridge in crash into the sea his suicide attack had failed but surely he had given the Goom on his staff one hell of a scare despite the bravery and determination the attack had failed to achieve a single hit 5 Avengers and two Marauders have been shot down the Japanese lost two zeroes  half an hour later at O 753 a new force was spotted approaching the mobile force 16 Marine Corps Dauntless dive bombers  nine zeros set out to destroy them the dive bombers pressed on and went for the hero instead of going for a steep dive ensuring accuracy these planes conducted a glide bombing attack they were clearly inexperienced pilots if this was their way of attacking they managed to bracket the heater with some near misses but ultimately no hits were scored they lost half of their squadron leaving only eight survivors to return to Midway the Japanese lost only one zero and shortly after that attack fifteen army b-17s attacked from 20,000 feet at this altitude the b-17s were immune to the anti-aircraft fire below them however this also greatly diminished their accuracy they went after the Soto he drew an ACOG II but the carrier's below them had more than enough time to conduct evasive maneuvers and avoid the bombs there were no losses on either sides and no hits were scored only near misses on the Soto and hero caused any alarm a remarkable set of photographs were taken at this moment here's the hero dodging a couple of very near misses note the three fighters of combat air patrol under flight deck here we got the ACOG II in the goomers flagship while under attack easily noticeable is the red Rising Sun painted on the deck and the third picture shows the Soto she's conducting a tight turn to starboard to avoid being hit carrier doctrine and flight deck operations need to be commented on here during attacks the main priority was obviously the defense of the carriers this came in three forms anti-aircraft fire combat air patrol and evasive maneuvers Japanese anti-aircraft fire capabilities were very weak so could not be counted on so dis left fighter cover and evasive maneuvers as the main forms of Defense for Nagumo's force there was a downside though one due to the evasive maneuvers that require wild and violent turns it was obviously dangerous to spot or launch a squadron of aircraft while being bombed so let's say you wanted to launch an airstrike but then you found yourself under attack it would actually be better to wait until the attack was over to then fire off for strike and second point as these pictures show Japanese flight decks had to be kept clear anyways during air attacks for the replenishment of their own fighters and this was rather frequent since a zero had about seven seconds of Canon ammunition fighters were given priority because they did after all provide the most effective measure of Defense hence the only activity you would see during attacks was the recovery replenishment and relaunching of these small packets of fighters three at a time sometimes six at a time in other words and the point I'm trying to drive in here was that as a general rule you couldn't launch a strike while under attack so let's just say hypothetically then at this moment Agumon wanted to send a strike it was prudent to just wait until the attack was over maybe 15 20 minutes and then launch his aircraft so maybe these attacks aren't being accurate or deadly but they are hindering flight operations keep this in mind as you will see the fateful consequences of it  Midway's final attack came at 2711 old marine corps Vindicator dive bombers arrived from the southeast these were obsolete bombers and they wisely decided not to go for the formatively defended carriers instead they selected the battleship Haruna as their target there were 11 fighters on combat air patrol to oppose them the Americans persisted and made their dives on the Haruna but once again none of them scored a hit to vindicate errs were lost during the attack and in the midst of all of this a submarine had been spotted in a oh wait when t5f fired a torpedo at the battleship Karishma the battleship dodge did by turning to port and the destroyer dashi was detached and sent in pursuit to chase down the summer as you can see this had all been a narrow escape for the Japanese these series of close calls surely had everyone on the edge of their seats although the Japanese were impressed by the determination of the attacks they were not impressed by the skills of these pilots just by 52 planes being dedicated to the attack not a single hit was achieved on the Japanese the biggest success these attacks had was that a had kept the Japanese off-balance from a 700 - Oh a 30 which as we will see was a critical time for Nagumo  during the early morning attacks on the Quito booty a more serious situation with developing in the high command with Nagumo and his staff surely after all 700 hours Nagumo received tominaga as report that a second strike was needed the news was unpleasant but had actually been expected how could a force of 72 bombers half of which were armed with medium sized bombs be expected to neutralize a fortified base he could allow tomonaga flight to return refuel and rearm and then send them back but of course this would take hours to complete allowing the Americans to lick their wounds and reform their defense this would contribute further casualties or alternatively he could strike the Americans while they were still down he could use his reserve aircraft who at the moment stood idly by doing nothing but these were exclusively off the table because Yamamoto had ordered them to be reserved in case of an enemy carrier task force appearing but surely Yamamoto wasn't expecting a Goomba to fight an entire battle with only half his strength I mean come on this was tantamount to making Nagumo fight this entire battle with one arm tied behind his back and this right here had been the fault in the whole midway plan there simply weren't enough planes there weren't enough planes to do the dual mission to both attack Midway and to keep a reserve in case enemy carriers appeared so Nagumo looked at the maps and by now his air searches were reaching their maximum range and so far nothing had been found or reported so why not use these planes for the second strike and let's not forget that at this moment a maverick plane from Midway had just tried to suicide crash into his bridge Midway was clearly still a threat and as long as his airbase was operational it posed a danger to his carriers this is what probably prompted Nagumo's consequent decision Midway had to be neutralized thus at 11:15 Nagumo went against Yamamoto's orders and ordered the rearmament of his reserve aircraft the rearming process began in the hangars below torpedoes were removed and lamb bombs installed the dive bombers weren't affected by this because they were armed once they have been spotted on the flight decks so in reality this chaotic fast-paced rearming process was happening only in the hangars of the first carrier division all in all this process was going to take about an hour and a half to complete then 30 minutes into the rearmament process at ol 7:45 Nagumo received a report that Tony plane the one that had been delayed ran across an American force site what appears to be ten enemy surface units Nagumo was stunned he quickly cancelled and reversed the rearmament order and took stock of the situation it will basically boil down to two options for him send an immediate strike right now or send the strike after Tom maracas planes were recovered this is what is most commonly known as Nagumo's dilemma so I will ask the viewer to put themselves in the Gumo shoes for a while to better understand his conundrum and I'll let you know it's not as simple as it looks many factors have to be considered keep in mind that you would have had only 15 minutes to decide on the correct course of action so let's first dive into the aggressive option which is attacking immediately okay first off deciding didn't even make sense based on the location Tony number 4 plane was never supposed to come across it either he wasn't where he was supposed to be or the task force location was incorrect this brings up the composition factor it was unknown what did 10 ships mean it could be a carrier task force or they could simply be auxilary ships Nagumo didn't know and this was unsettling what if he sends a strike and the sighting proved to be just as stories or support ships this had actually happened to an emoticon a month earlier in the Battle of Coral Sea Nagumo did not want a repeat of that mistake but there were two additional alarming clues about the sighting why was there force 240 miles northeast of Midway there would be no reason for a force to be in this location unless it contained a carrier and if it was a carrier it would be in a prime position to unleash an attack on the Japanese's flank and more importantly why was a steering into the wind as it was known it was procedure for aircraft carriers to steam into the wind when launching the aircraft Nagumo and his staff apparently saw the validity of these two clues but in the end came to the conclusion that it was most likely just a surface force second the rearmament process wasn't as devastating as many believe the Val dive bombers weren't affected by this only the Cates 34 had been armed with torpedoes but now only 19 were ready 15 have been switched to land bombs so instead of having a full strike complement of 78 planes he now only had 64 planes properly armed although that's only a difference of 15 64 planes were more than enough to sink any task force encountered and here's a third factor time Nagumo was restricted on time because tominaga spores would soon be arriving at about Oh a 15 and it would be low on fuel meaning they had to be landed quickly unless they were forced to ditch se this was the worst timing ever for Nagumo Japanese flight decks were restricted in that they could only do one operation at a time they could either launch recover or spot aircraft thus Nagumo had to decide either launch his counter strike now or recover the Midway strike the fuel situation was troubling if he didn't want to lose any more plane stretching he needed to finish the recovery by Oh 8:45 the latest why oh wait 45 well let's take a look and work backwards to calculate the time constraints it's also in 45 now tominaga splaine's had enough field to fly overhead until about oh nine fifteen it would take 20 to 30 minutes to land him that makes oh wait 45 the threshold you better finish your launching process by this time or I'll start losing aircraft by ditching this leaves Nagumo with an hour of leeway and it took about 45 minutes to spot and launch an air strike so if he wants to take this opportunity to launch an attack with what he's got he can but he would have to start the process by Oh 800 the latest thus this is the 15 minute window Nagumo got to make a decision geez talk about being under pressure huh was an attack feasible yes it was it will be a tight squeeze but if he began now by Oh a hundred by Oh a forty-five his counter strike would have taken off in tominaga explains who will be flying on fumes at this point with Dan land however scratch that hypothetical because I also in fifty-three dakedo boot I came under attack by those dive bombers theoretically he could still launch a strike while under attack although this was rarely done in combat and it was extremely risky but one thing was for sure that 45-minute launching process would have definitely stretched out closer to the length of an hour as a result the possibility of tominaga Zaire group having to commit a mass ditch would become likely disposing of perhaps dozens of aircraft at the start of a battle was unthinkable  so Nagumo had to decide does he attack this unknown target based in this sketchy unconfirmed location with some of his planes carrying the wrong ordnance and risk losing additional planes by unnecessary ditching or he could simply wait until tominaga strike had landed and then after recovery launch a full balanced strike and whatever this target is with the proper ordnance this was clearly the ultra safe choice that offered no unnecessary risk but what made Nagumo think he still had time well if we take the reported position face-value the location meant that even if this force contained a carrier it wouldn't have been within strike range of an escorted strike the Americans will have to close a distance and then launch a strike which meant it wouldn't reach Nagumo's carriers until about 10:15 some two hours from now thus Nagumo would have the time to launch his own counter strike before he himself was reached so I asked a viewer to press pause and consider the options honestly with all this information at hand what would you have done  with the conservative mindset in aguma had it's not too difficult to imagine which course of action he took he went for the safest option he would recover his plane's first and then launch a powerful well balanced strike at the enemy the gumo opted for this choice because it promised mass and coordination over anything else for as much as Nagumo has been criticized his decision was doctrinal if any other Japanese commander had been in his place they would have also made the same decision  so let's continue the saga down below the crews and the hangars worked feverishly to change the Kate's with Lam bombs back again two torpedoes in the midst of all the chaos the bombs were not stored away safely instead they were laid haphazardly around the hangar above in the bridge Nagumo waited impatiently for further information and it wasn't until oh wait 20 that identification of the surface units finally came through the enemy is accompanied by what appears to be a carrier this was dreadful news well you may ask why not attack now that you have definite confirmation of a carrier well it would still take 45 minutes to get the aircraft out of the hangar spotted and launched meanwhile tominaga zaire group would all run out of fuel and crash into the sea and just there you lost 97 planes also the strike would have to go uh Ness courted since all the fighters have been brought up to assist in the air defense of the mobile force during the recent attacks so the option of launching an undistorted strike which was bound to receive heavy losses and lose 97 planes Dramastic wasn't seriously going to be considered by Nagumo basically it was too late for Nagumo to attack now he had made his bed and now he had to lay in it he would have to wait thankfully for him the last morning attacks die down by o8 37 the kiddo boot I finally got a break from all the morning attacks and could now begin recovering the aircraft from Oh 8 37 - Oh 910 tominaga strike force was safely landed while one can sympathize with the predicament Nagumo is in there was a decision that was questionable the Kido boot I changed course to the northeast after recovering the air strike why this was not necessary Japanese planes out range the Americans there was no reason to close the gap it would just make it quicker for your opponent to reach you a wiser decision would have been to head Northwest still allowing you to strike back but keeping you at the extreme striking range of the Americans with the last of his aircraft recovered Nagumo was now free to begin spotting his planes on the decks it was looking good for Nagumo all he needed now was a 45-minute uninterrupted window and a powerful counter-strike will be dealt to the Americans however events with soon foil his high hopes  off to the north enemy aircraft were spotted damn instead of preparing to launch a strike in the gumo would now be forced into evasive maneuvers and focus on protecting his carriers from the forthcoming assault these 15 Devastator torpedo bombers were coming in and with no escorts they would be easy prey for the 30 fighters that were protecting the mobile force the four carriers turn to port to present their stern to the incoming attackers what followed next was a stern pursuit which put the devastators at a disadvantage because of their slow speed they could barely break a hundred knots while carrying their ordnance the fighters swarmed over them with impunity and they were cut to pieces two-thirds were intercepted before they were even close to making their run-ins only three got close enough to threaten de Soto but ultimately only one just one of the 15 who was able to launch its torpedo  however not only the history Domus but the pilot was shot down himself  the attack had lasted about 15 minutes although the Japanese probably didn't know it at the moment they had just destroyed an entire squadron and there were no hits to stand for it there would only be one survivor of the 30 aircrew who participated in this heroic attack  but as soon as that attack was over at Oh 9:40 another one began this time from the south it was at this time that Nagumo had to have realized that his mobile force was in serious trouble it was imperative than a gumo get his planes off the deck before being hit himself all he needed was a 45-minute window to launch an airstrike but during attacks he couldn't launch a strike because his flight decks were solely occupied with the replenishment of the combat air patrol fighters to add to the mess he was in a dangerous state because at the moment he was at his most vulnerable his planes were fully fueled armed and parked densely within the hangars of his carriers and more disturbingly it was clear that these were carrier base bombers obviously the reported location of the carriers had been wrong this whole time they had actually been 55 miles closer when they were spotted out 728 thus his mobile force had been within American strike range this entire time this is a clear example of the fog of war just like at Coral Sea the Japanese commander had made a decision based on the information at hand although unbeknownst to him the information having incorrect sometimes you can just plain out have bad luck one thing was for sure Japanese Scout planes needed to practice their ship identification and spotting skills oh well maybe Nagumo can dodge this attack as well the 14 torpedo bombers came in honest courted the two divisions had selected the kaga as their target and they were trying to do an anvil attack on the slow carrier but it would be difficult to do with their slow lumbering planes initially they came in on a post but then zeros swarmed over them and the rightmost division took the brunt of the attack two torpedoes were launched with the kaga dodged him  with additional zeros added to the fray only three torpedoes from the other division were released but just as before the kaga skillfully avoided them as well once again an attack have been pressed on gallantly by the Americans but it had been ineffective nine of the 14 bombers were shot down and of these five survivors one had to ditch on the return trip only one zero was lost and when that attack finished guess what another one began you have got to be kidding for the last 50 minutes these piecemeal attacks although as ineffective as they were were delaying the launch of the desperately needed Japanese Counter Strike in more frightening judging this to be the third torpedo squadron there definitely had to be more than one carrier actually there wasn't just one there were three boy it wasn't a Gumo in trouble also the Japanese must have asked themselves at this point where were the dive bombers if the devastators had made it this far an imminent dive bombing attack was sure to come but something was different with his forthcoming attack these twelve torpedo bombers came in with an escort of six Wildcats the zero set out to intercept him but little did they know they were in for a surprise for the first time in the war the famous statue was used named so by its creator Jimmy thatch who was leading the division the planes would start in a beam defense position once a zero was on the table Wildcat the two sections would turn towards each other this allowed one section to get a head-on attack on the chase and zero it would either kill or brush off two zeros on your partner's tail the process could easily be repeated this defensive maneuvers stunned the zero pilots up to this point in the war the Japanese pilots would always come out victorious in dogfights against their opponents but now they were the ones getting beaten for zeroes were shot down and only one wildcat was lost during this interception  Thach in his fighter squadron alone attracted the attention of over 2009 first the escort had done an excellent job 11 of the 12 diverse layers were actually able to push through for their run-ins and this post a considerable threat to the carriers this caused the remaining zeros who were looking up for any nearby dive bombers to descend from their high altitude patrols to shoot down these intruders therefore as we can see the northeast sector became a magnet sucking in all the fighters on combat air patrol disturbingly does have the effect of leaving the carriers with no overhead protection what we are seeing here is a dangerous example of target fixation all eyes were glued on this developing threat that the situational awareness that is keeping a lookout for any other threats was forgotten this was leaving the kita booty in a vulnerable state  the American bombers carried on but with fresh zeroes diving from above the Devastator stood little chance to prevail the same story played out and over half were shot down eventually only five would end up launching at the hero but the Japanese carrier successfully avoided them the end result would be that 10 of the 12 torpedo bombers were lost and one of their four escorts for no hits this last torpedo attack probably accounted for about seven fighters the time was 10:20 the torpedo attack was halfway through and as expected not one had struck home it was a testament to the prowess of the Japanese pilots the Kido booty had been in combat for the last three hours and had avoided all the bombs and torpedoes thrown at it with its evasive maneuvers and its skilled fighters Nagumo had been quite lucky actually his mobile force with no radar has shot down 53 aircraft at his point and had lost only 11 fighters itself and there wasn't even a scratch on his ships but it was precisely at this moment when all the fighters were down below fighting off this latest assault in the northeast sector that a new threat emerged high above 50 dive bombers were approaching overhead undetected and unopposed and coming from two different directions Nagumo's luck had finally run out  [Music] [Applause]  dakedo boot I had never been faced with the feet before in the previous six months they had ruled the Seas they had sunk five capital ships on light carrier two cruisers and half a dozen destroyers but now they're unbroken string of victories would come to an end these dive bombers weren't rookies like the Midway based bombers these were the eighteen of the Pacific Fleet and with no opposition the result would be deadly from the South came two squadrons in the all teamed up on one carrier the enormous cargo 30 dive bombers began their steep dives from 19,000 feet takagi was practically taken by surprise and she received four hits one of which landed on the bridge killing the captain and his staff the planes being fully fueled and armed inside the hangar ignited causing a chain of secondary explosions she quickly became an inferno the Soto was attacked by 13 dive bombers three bombs were placed evenly along the center her flight deck all her hangars were hit and just like the kaga the bombs set off a chain of explosions inside the ship fires immediately engulf the carrier and looked after the acog 'i might get off scot-free however when the cargo is being pummeled three dive bombers peeled off at the last moment and went for her with pure scale a bomb was dropped in its upper hangar it didn't seem serious at first a carrier this big could have certainly survived his single hit but just like her sister ships the planes and bombs inside her hangars began to detonate thereafter fire spread uncontrollably and the acog II the flagship of the Kino butai was doomed  [Music] in less than five minutes history had changed the powerful Kido boot I have been rent only one have been able to escape destruction the hero the outcome of the battle now rested upon the shoulders of the hero and her early pilots [Music]  you [Music]  you", "W5tlGJwvmCQ": "One of the keys is Remember where you came from? Keep that shit in the front of your mind and when shit goes bad and it goes sideways a lot of shit Does you're getting booed out the fucking building or coming through this injury or people? Are you writing you off? Are you guys gonna fucking make it you know any of that shit? You got it. You got to keep it in here The and it really has to It should Drive you This idea and this notion that you could be anything you want you can accomplish anything you want, right? We hear that you've heard that from the time we were little boys You hear that now, you're already incredibly accomplished You can win an NBA championship MVP of the league you could become president You could become governor you can have you could be in in in in You could be an entertainment you could do Charles and you do Shaq you lose that you could do whatever you want to do. You guys know that? The thing that has worked for me is to remember The hard times so And I'm sure you guys all have your processes. And again, I'm going to tell you what to work for me. So before A big movie comes out before back in the days when I was wrestling with WWE a Wrestlemania match Anything big that would happen. I would always take a moment and I just remind myself All right. I was evicted when I was 14. We were kicked off the island. We couldn't live in Hawaii and no place to live a Lot of shit happened then when I moved to Nashville I was arrested multiple times by the time I was 16 years old. I got remember that if I were playing on this team Which might you know? my skills are what's that term all the shit's so I never played but before I lace up before I get on court before I playing these big games before I go to the Staples Center Where history says those are those are historic will Hall Sahara at the Staples Center I would remember that and it allows me then to be present in the moment and understand. Holy shit. That's the stuff I have around me right now. This is this shit that I dreamed of when I was a kid I am here. I played for University of Miami played great teams Warren Sapp where Lewis there were my teammates. They were ballin Warren Sapp was playing tight end that time. I was starting defensive tackle. They moved him over to d-line And he looked at me. He's like yo, do I'm gonna take your spot. I said, you ain't taking my fuckin spot He's I'm gonna take your spot We battled and he took my spot They can imagine how that fuck with me cuz there goes my opportunity He went in switch to defensive tackle lit the world on fire Well what that did it crushed me to crush my dreams. I had a piss-poor senior year zero production No NFL no combine invite Nothing finally went to the CFL Calgary Stampeders making $250 a week Canadian Canadian I had to send that shit home To my to my wife at that time I had no money so I remember that I got cut from Canada. I had 7 bucks in my pocket And I always tell that story. So now my production company 7 bucks advertising agency 7 bucks. Everything is 7 bucks I always remember that what helps me is to keep the hard times in the front of my mind Because it allows me to go into these big Moments that I've worked my ass off and you guys have worked your ass off It allows me to go into these big moments with a different perspective What it also does for me and again this just this is what works for me like I Keep my back excuse my language. My back is up against this motherfucker Every day it's against this fucking wall. Excuse my language But it's a begins this motherfucker because it's what I believe in and when my back is against this motherfucker then there's nowhere to go But that way that's it So I feel like this could be something an ideology mindset that could help you Could if you look at it that way Because you made it already we made it We're successful boys and we're lucky boys to be we're at oh you guys made it everybody in the room Nobody's gonna get evicted anymore Anything you got there's no more money problems, right? You got a lot of hands out now I get a little bit Can I get a little bit right that happens? But when you make it For me I need this I need this So every day my back is up against this motherfucker and this is how I operate Now doesn't mean don't smile. There's me to laugh and joke Right happy I'm happy. I'm a happy guy But when it comes to business and when it comes to executing what's up against this? And I gotta go that way And I don't give a fuck who is in front of me. They're not gonna stop me. I feel like for me it feels seamless Because you prepared for so long, but it's just like you guys prepping for a game. That's the fun part That's where it's like fuck is fun and people are paying their hard-earned dollars to come see you. They're cheering. They're going bananas They're booing the shit out of you or on the road. It's that's fun. That's what you live for I mean, that's the juice right there The prep is where the characters made and I just don't mean the character I play I mean the fucking the character in here So for me the prep is getting with the director getting with the producers getting with the writers getting with the getting with so in essence it's like getting with all your coaches and your different position coaches and and all the Meetings that you have to have right? So that's the work you put in the key for me was Where does it start? What's the anchor? What's the anchor so I could have all these ambitions and you guys have all these ambitions, which is great It's important. I'll play this role. You'll play that role. I'll execute this thing and it'll come out this summer you guys will execute this thing during the summer right what it's time to really put in a lot more work But the key with me is just always finding what the anchor is and the fuck and anchor is Getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning everyday before anybody else and Grounding. My thought process is in the no one will outwork me No one I love and I respect you guys Motherfuckers one that worked me I'll start with this Two hands putting it'll work. The anchor for me has always been the work in terms of the weight room training So when I first started wrestling I was six years old rolling on the mats with my dad my old man. A lot of you guys will know this Yeah, Rocky Johnson My old man was Rocky Johnson was the first black WWF tag WWWF at that time first black WWE tag team champions were Tony Atlas back in 1983 My uncle's were wild Samoans. I come from a long line of pro wrestlers but before the wrestling part happened I was just in the gym putting in the work at six years old rolling around on the mats and finally when I could touch Weights at 13. That's what I was doing But the weight part for me and the gym part Has has always been has to be the anchor look at the end of the day like again That's it's the kind of stuff that I talked about at top is I have to hold on to My dad in his pickup truck came down four o'clock in the morning Pick me up at in whoo in Miami from Tampa. We lived in a little shitty apartment in Tampa He drove down in his little pickup truck to Miami to get me when I was cut from the CFL. I was driving up I 75 I don't know if you guys are from Florida any of you guys if you know It's I 75 is like especially down in Florida, Alligator Alley I'll never forget it's four o'clock in the morning, and I thought well fuck that. I leave home like you guys left home I'm ready to tackle the world to get after it achieve my dreams and goals fucking crushed by 22 23 years old I'm now I got to move back in with my mom and dad. I played on great teams. Oh, wait a second This is not supposed to be my future. I'm supposed to be in the NFL right now I'm supposed to be making a lot of coin and behind my parents shit buying me shit taking care of my wife But it never happened. So I pulled in my wallet. I thought well, let me see how much money I have I opened it up. I had a 5 a 1 and change I'm not fucking around and I Rounded up to 7 bucks But I thought God ain't this a bitch. I got 7 bucks in my pocket. Where the fuck do I go now? What'd I do? I can't go back to CFL coz I are you know? The point comes where you hear that voice big runs over like you're done, right? So I heard that voice so as coach was saying man. I hold on to that shit. I'm telling you I keep my back as Perkins's motherfucker. We laugh we joke, we have a good time Press is always fun to do sometime. You got to make it fun That's another thing he had to do your best to make press fun Who as you can but my back is still up against this motherfucker I do not forget it what this also helps me do and again it works for me is At some point you got to be fucking tired of not being number one You have to be and you got a fucking plate angry and I play angry now I'm cool and calm with my approach and when I step out on my field, which is a set or you know like There's something you're always gonna have haters and haters like well Yeah, man, how many movies you're gonna make her how much shit are you gonna do like you do a lot of shit? I say yes Cuz my ambition of course why not I could do it Yeah, I love what I do and not only that but in what world do we not work every day? It doesn't mean it's just like you guys in the off season. You got work every fucking day Doesn't end my back is up against this thing, you know, and I and I and I started to play Angry, by the way, and and I still I still play angry my last match Brock lesner Transition and I realized if I had to be great at something I wanted to be great in this world of Hollywood and movie making and producing and entertainment I had to commit and like you guys have to commit obviously you commit to something commit to the goal So I quietly retired two years later. I thought what the fuck did I do in my career? Cuz my movies were not doing well I was written off I was like around 2006 2007 I was like goddamn. I left I pulled a Jim Brown I left when I was on top like number one in the wrestling business and I left it was a ballsy gutsy So I'm called it stupid move, but I had to commit and I had to follow it wasn't my god And at that time I'll share this with you guys and Will Smith is my boy And I sat down at that time with the agency I was with and I said, what do you want to accomplish? I said I want to accomplish the world. I want the world and I want I want Will Smith's career But and I said and I mean this respectfully because I know he's here at this age. See with us I want to do it bigger and better? and They looked at me like I had three fucking heads and they were like. Mm-hmm. Okay but I still stayed focused and I still had these still put in the hard work with my two hands and That's it. And that's what it comes down to with you guys. One of the keys is Remember where you came from? Keep that shit in the front of your mind and when shit goes bad It goes sideways a lot of shit Does you're getting booed out the fucking building or coming through this injury or people? Are you writing you off? Are you guys gonna fucking make it you know any of that shit? You got it. You got to keep it in here And it really has to It should drive you", "AXdG577px94": "sort of work with Bruce Lee 1967 he was a kung-fu martial artists or gum fruit whichever word you want to use I've been an American fighter we didn't think much of kung fu fighters because most of them didn't fight did it a lot of that what we call finger paints type moves you know moving the hands around like finger painters there was a black belt magazine Washington DC complaining about how they had misspelled my name in the magazine and Bruce Lee was there in the office at the time so when I left the office I walked out to park allowed to go back home and Bruce Lee comes running outside hi Joe Joe Joe let me talk to you for a second and he stood in front of me in for about thirty minutes he was trying to explain to me why his JIT kundo style JIT kundo means way of the stopping fist he was telling about instead of throwing a horizontal punch like this she threw a vertical punch instead of put your power side back like a box with standing you put your power side forward and you explain many of the principles and tactics it she can dope demonstrated or utilized which may disappear to the way we were doing karate at that time and it just all went in one ear and out the other later in 1968 early 68 I was doing a nightclub act with myself Bob wall he Bob wall with co-star of that film end of the Dragon and Mike stone we were kind of like buddies at that time my fat Bob and I were living together we business partners at the end of each nightclub at Mike Stone and I would do a little demonstration karate match and then I noticed his style had changed and he started telling he was working out with his Chinese guy named Bruce Lee and he said Bruce Lee wants to work with you you should go down and start taking lessons with probably less Allah so eventually I took his advice and Bruce Lee and I got contact with each other and once a week I would go there and take a pride with Bruce and spend the whole rest of week working on what he would show and it actually in a great way improved my fighting style I'd say its main quality was a his charm he can charm anybody here's here's a tip hook us up I would every day I'd walk into his house first thing he had to do it Oh Chuck Elmo's gonna come on Nestle yeah and they go oh yeah job on for sure you always had to show some part of his body working on I remember one day wakes up at 75 pound barbell he locks down a position in standing positions starts on his chest he sticks it straight out like this slow motion but holds it sustains try try would half that way and then you know what 75 pounds feels like and I know guys who can benchpress 500 pounds they can get it out but they can't hold their goal is not and since gets how they fall yes so he's it was pretty strong he was a great artist and his very fast he could sketch out some through fur I remember him drawing a leopard he was going to do this role called south flute the scylla fought and he were doing together and one of the parts he was gonna play the leopard man [Music]  the leopard man does boob it's like a leopard so for example if I'm going to through a strike like a snake I'll make a hand like a snake and I move about the snakes and now if it's going to be like a crane I'll make a move like a crane I'll strike the Adam's apple you know the brachial plexus I'll strike the eyeball see now if I'm going to move like a leopard shield leopards have claws okay bear has a circle all Tiger has another type of a claw follow me so Guerra would hook the wrist in this way was a tiger would keep it all straight and the rip inside out or watch a line going to Buffalo some they grab the belly this way and rip it open see Bruce would talk to you about those kinds of things now although I was already an amateur world champion and a two-time national champion for started work with Bruce I think he helped accelerate my career helped me defeat all the top guys in competition at that time and helped me go back and think about getting away from porn fighting put full-contact back on the map let me explain and point fighting threw a punch and you stopped let's say two three inches or sometimes maybe an inch from the target or you can make light contact except for the face and that's what point fighting is called they're trying to find each other out to make the other man turn defense isn't coming close it has a side crust in the kitchen I never understood point fighting cause to me the purpose of a punch the purpose of a cake is to do damage how you do damage if you missing the target I always felt accuracy was the holy grail of just about any sport and I came back to this country of throwing punches and kicks not making contact and then you got to fight some little bitty guy he just waves his foot at your head of something and they give in to victory so that made me well enough to bad taste my mouth forgets the sport gentle soul Bruce Lee kind of got me back into the full context of because we studied a lot of old boxing films like Willie Pell pull out in Chinese Field is pound for pound best fight of all time some people told Shiva at Robinson is would watch Willie pubs footwork we will watch the explosiveness of some of Jack Dempsey's fight films we watch the stationary position of the great jewelers when he got on the inside like end up in the pocket we'd watch the distancing and mobility tactics of a of a Muhammad Ali and it kind of got me interested in the full-contact as opposed to the the stationary kind of you hit me I hit you back you returned my turn type fighting so I got tired and I got kind of really disgusted with what they called point fighting and so I decided I'm going to go in and and create a new sport and just call it full contact or something so so around 1969 I started really drifting out of the point fighting tournament scene think 68 was my best year I won 11 consecutive grand championships without a loss and I think that's still a record to this day 1970s a stuntman named Lee Faulkner you know one of my students calls me up and he wants to do a World Team Championships I agreed to fight on the West Coast team which consisted of myself Mike stone Chuck Darcy and my business part of the time lose Bob wall Bob watch and talk to people into putting him on the team so I told promoters to look the only way I'll fight on this team because I'm tired and sick disappointing fighting stuff is if you give me a match where after wear boxing gloves and we go at it for real he said okay if I get you a match were you doing I said fine so so he asked me who do I want to fight well I didn't like the Shotokan fighters the Japanese fighters are very arrogant so I started with the very top I went down the list and everybody said no until I got down to this kid who was a California state champion big black kid his name was Greg Baines and he changed his name to own so I called him up he's in Northern California asked him would he do a full-contact match and he said yeah I'll be there jack but I knocked him out three minutes another fighting myself a lockdown [Music] as I walked into the ring that night the announcer he says alright lady inches gentlemen we're getting ready to watch for the first time kickboxing and that's where the word kick box has started here in America he used it so in the record books they made me the father of American kickboxing  you  actually went seven different world titles but only claimed one once you're world champion what does it make whether twenty time world champion or at one time we're chat I am proud of this fact I was the first martial artists in the world to win a World Championship Tudor in sports I went to work title in karate and also kickboxing I won 7 different titles some of them were amateur titles some in professional times some of them were no no holds bar like you could throw elbows I was never knocked down in my life so I'm kind of proud of that I was dazed one time that was in a training session Joey or Beals I take 65 Ring Magazine radium the fifth-ranked headway at all time he his sparring partner at that time was Kidd Norton now at that time he had thought she was voted the greatest boxing coach of all time in a 23 world champion he was training both of them and durable used to knock Ken Norton up every day almost when they sparred with a liver Shawn and joy wanted to show me the boxes were superior to karate guys so he got me in the ring one day we were sparring he popped me or that liver shot and I saw what we call the white light you know just this flash of this huge white light and you back arches back because electricity goes through your body and it just locked you up and that as soon as that white light disappears you see all these hundreds of thousands of little bitty white sparkling lights coming down and you can't move and you can't yell because you're in such great pain there's no air left in your lung and pardon my french way he steps back says boom I'll hit you again and he looked at me I could see the rage 90 wants to draw blood you know that and then he yells at me hugged and and so I started side seven look blade they have taught me earlier I don't know how I'm about half dead but I can move you know and he came over and I started keep moving and now rods you don't care how much pain you're in as long as you can move it's harder for your opponent to finish you off if you're moving target then if you're stationary and that's why I going back to full contact that's why I like the kickboxing because it was real and there's no greater pleasure in the world on the sports mellowing hit somebody in you and here go and you look in

Live on pay-per-view what did you say James you hate boxing absolutely not you sure wait a minute who said that Bob Arum it's that's old news James we're here to talk about UFC 118 [Music] you don't want me to be counting McGregor's um ma god oh no oh dear I've been waiting for six hours to talk to you what tell you the way I don't want this but I didn't know I was going to interview No we never shouted my little story I've been always going to interview no I didn't say that I didn't say that now now you'd like to put words in my mouth don't do that what I've already spoke about what I say I'm gonna leave it there okay I'm not going I'm not gonna keep engaging in this okay fair enough no one's doubting that but just wanted to get the reason I want to antagonize him you want to aggravate him and get him pissed off that absolutely not totally the truth that's why I do what your question was right when I called it right when you picked up the microphone you've never even asked questions first usually hang back and wait oh you had to get that last question you do what you want god forbid you want to what do you have any questions about the fight not right now okay what's the severity of your your hand injury what do you say how injured is your hand man you know you gotta use layman's terms in telling me oh man come on man don't be trying to show your education upper here at man come on don't don't don't do me like that the hand what about what you want to know your hand what about how hard is it hurt isn't hurting up what boa is right now Dana just one for you when you say that you're gonna take care of your Merrill what do you mean by that can you elaborate what does that mean that's between me and your Romero well you there is thanks for asking that's between us no I know but there is the precedent with Carlos Condit and GSP where is there really not a precedent there's there's different scenarios and different situations but it's not worry about what your Romero's gonna make man y'all take care of that there were nine sections that were completely empty up top do you know it was there a specific reason for that was their reason why the section was empty it just because opposite way they were all full so I was just curious if those were blocked off for some reason there were just nine sections in a row that were empty up top question about Dana White first you said you're gonna knock them out but now yesterday at the press conference it seems as though you actually like him one more question James one more question one more question James one more question for you know one more question James there he goes James Toney i'ma go see the doctor i'ma go see the doctor maybe Tuesday because you know but I see this look this is look this little thing right here is swollen honestly honestly it is I know it's bad but this thing where his woman I gotta check that out I'm alright you know I wasn't gonna do this interview but they told me I had to so you know I feel good I'm ready to fight and I don't know that's I don't have much to say Frank Mir gets hurt bless you don't be sneezing my interview next time next you wait I smell gas or a little blow our ass up over here I can smell gas anyway like I was saying I forgot what I was saying oh that's me again well let me ask you a quick question wrong area oh no air you like me groans oh okay you know let's hash this out if I requested to be on your show you know like that ain't really fighters you know like I tried to be on your show you know I hit you uh when I get a big vitamin you know it's just like they should just don't rub me the right way what do you want to know well rampage congratulations on on a very dominant win I thought so fake congratulations coming out of your mouth right now honestly ma'am you know man fucking stupid internet radio that's it you're gonna do this yeah ma'am this is not before we get to the comings and goings and footage let's talk about the fight we just witnessed you were in the corner of Cheick Kongo you saw him go down early what was going through your mind man you know I was like no you know Chicano just came up a bad injury spine injury and my new this fight was gonna be a big challenge for them with personal challenge and I was I was just shocked because I've never seen will it go bring it down like that and went down twice and then when he came brought it back up back up I was relieved do you think the fight should have been stopped let's me something like this worried about Kongo safety but he showed that he was still you know saying in the fight why do you ask me something like that no I don't think the fight should have been so close if he had laid there and sprawled out yeah please say that my brother stopped the fight but he didn't show that he's so hard and dedicates that he won't win his fight and then sent me a lot about his personality because trust me most people come up in trees like they have to retire the injury that he had so kudos to Mariana for for letting it go number 24 what do you think did you hear something different you're giving me the sometime actually like why do you even talk to me let let it max wise I thought we squashed it you guys Stepanek a to go [Music] you look good today guitar your denver's you got a 5 round tile fight in that altitude gonna bother you I don't bother me that much because you don't say I'm a fighter I'll fight on the moon if I have to that's really high altitude those really have to quit I have to fight this thing about John Jones the guy's been on a roll he just beat Shogun back there quick ok so your thoughts on your opponent John show and he's putting the champion he's been smashing everyone yeah I got an ass-whooping by him your thoughts you fall down though yeah I think I did see that fight Hey  you", "_hgshQF2JfY": "[Music]  hi everybody welcome to Aikido flow now sometimes it's unfortunate but you need to knock some people out you know you might be in a certain situations where it's necessary you know that's the reality of things so today we've gotta have a look at this now sometimes you might be in a situation where you're up against more than one person there might be three of them four of them okay so the last thing you want to do is be fighting with somebody you know you take them down in a way then the next minute they're mates on you and then this person's getting up and then you're taking down he's getting up and everyone's falling down and getting up getting up sometimes you need to just put somebody down and put them down hard you need to literally knock them out so hopefully what happens be not that person out his friends or her friends will be like woah hey I don't want that to happen to me and they're backing off the situation is dissolved you don't have to fight anymore because you took out the first one so hard that the other people don't want a piece of there sometimes is actually necessary you know we don't condone it but to save yourself is necessary so I'm gonna show you three knockout Aikido moves now the first technique okay I love to say I can with it myself but it was a friend of mine a colleague of mine name is Darren worked together at Tiger Tiger Vic she had to you down if you're watching okay he actually did this technique to me and he showed me okay it to me and I didn't do it to me hard but believe me it made me drop literally one knee to the ground so I know if he did it to me at full force it would have taken me out all he did was here okay and on your neck here you got tendons here you got nerves and everything here really it would have side of his hand he just went boom now that was a big guy but he's used the weight of his hand to do that and literally took me out so I imagine the scenario where someone's kind of coming where they want to hit you here and you go bang you hit him hard boom not even kind of pull him back by literally taking that through boom the weight of that went your whole body behind it taking down right in his neck get it right right there boom that list you wanted it to me it's a shock through my body and it just went up I went there on a one knee and you know I was able to maintain hey you know I maintain that I'm good I had to say I took a blow from Darin and survived because not many people have taken blows him down and survived but he did that to me and it literally it weakened me I felt the shock wave so that's the first technique nice chop straight to the side of the neck here bang take it always through a ball like strike like like the person you want you want to hit is down here so you're going all the way through them ball taking it all the way down side of the hand body weight speed take it through on the neck it will take them out I've knocked him out cold trust me okay next technique okay another technique I'm going to steal what we should change the video to Aikido stolen techniques but I'm okay it's the next technique a and were working way back in the days the first started working in a club called Bar rumba gay central London it was a female security okay now she was like no-holds-barred she you couldn't mess up with this woman she was like you know she was one then you know I would happily choose her to back me in a fight any day you know as a situation where some had a bit of a problem several guys involved you know bit just leanness and that and then one M's getting real aggressive I'm telling you she came in and because she was quite sure this technique worked ideally for her like I don't leave went for grab we went for a hook or something but she just came here and she literally opened palm smacked him boom on the chin now when I won I initially saw it I thought she hit him in the nose but literally she came in is when bang smacked him on his chin and just took him out the guy like it was like what a lumberjack I see every day he felt like a tree initially the fell boom and hit the ground now as only when later on we looked at the CCTV and I saw what she actually done which is literally a hard palm strike to the chin his nose wasn't bleeding or anything on that so it didn't make contact with his nose is this sheer honesty so she came in and went boom bang and just took him down and that just nursery is I think at the time the guy's mouth was open so the bottom jaw hit his top jaw and I think the shockwave must have gone to his brain because he just like bang hit the ground he was out cold so that is might I mean not my technique that's her technique way that's how you knock somebody out cold there's a story behind his next technique okay true story ba rumba again okay this is when I first kind of started out doing security this was like nearly you're probably about 18 years ago or something like that okay head doorman Andy okay now I just started okay I was like one of the boys I was downstairs in the club said to by the fire exit you know fresh fresh off the boat security okay so I get a call on the radio cuz as you please come to the front door please head doorman says to me as you I should need to go to the toilet okay stay here don't let no one in wait till I come back head doorman Andy love that guy to this days now ambulance driver but yeah love you and II hope you're watching so Andy goes through the toilet I'm stand on the door two guys come up they want to get in I said sorry guys you have to wait blah blah they just start getting aggravation with me okay so one of them starts flicking my badge I've got a badge around my security burger on it so it's flicking it flick Utley flicking it badly and I had a temper I couldn't control my temper okay I've learned since so I say to him you flipped my badge one more time you watch to see what happens this fall flipped my badge again so what happened was okay he's there flicking my badge okay like the second time he went for it I blocked his hand boom I smashed him here bang on his neck and I pulled his head down and I went crying I mean to his face and he just fell backwards and he was out cold okay done his mate was there as well his mate whoa whoa back Tawfik a mate Ralph forgot the police so please come one guy on the floor out cold who's makes their half in tears police officer and he comes upstairs from the toilet is as you I left you here for five minutes you know I would never forget a day I felt so bad you know I feel like I let him down but good listener be there for five minutes it comes back police officer why go underground one guy half in tears in his light first time standing on a front door by myself of a nightclub and well you know fortunately Andy forgave me so I'm still working there but it was all good but it's over again it was literally as he went it was just literally here bang bang and that was it just drag his head down lead to the face and his light and I pulled him down my knee was come up at the same time mmm I went overboard you know but you know that was me back then you know I couldn't betray my anger you know he just really annoyed the hell out of me but since then working on the doors these things happen all the time you learn you can't go around doing it all the time if not I've spent MA it's been all the time the cost in fact the only reason why I didn't get arrested is because the camera was behind the door and where I made a connection with the guys face was right behind a wooden panel that's what the police officer told me he said if it wasn't for that I'd be arresting you right now but I know their evidence on the CCTV would have stand up in court so you're lucky this time so I got away with that one what a since then never done that again but if you want to knock someone out that's what you need to do it sorry conclusion okay sometimes you need to knock some people out not because of your ego but for your own safety because sometimes you need to destroy someone in order for others to get the message and for them to back off because if you don't and they sense a little bit weakness the next minute you've got five people attacking you and that's when you're finished so it is necessary sometimes I don't condone it but sometimes for your own safety it is necessary to expect to spend a night in the police cell you know it takes them hours to watch the CCTV gather statements for its lku act in a self defense okay you can go home you know but sometimes it has to be done it has to be done so if ever you're in a fight and you don't want to lose and you feel you need to choose use Aikido flows three knockout moves we'll see you next time [Music] Oh  Oh", "Ex1dbF73N8E": "", "MqxxrmF-rvU": "Hello Hi, how are you?

I don't have a job right now, but that has to do with my situation and stuff so What's your situation I suffer from anxiety and depression disorder so um about like Two or three months ago. I was bedridden, and I hadn't left my house in a couple months When I was 14 I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder I suffered from a lot of panic attacks. I, you know, I couldn't leave my house most days. I couldn't leave my room I couldn't get out of bed It felt like my mind had given up on me, I just, I didn't, I didn't see any future I, I just didn't wanna be here anymore and You start to, you know, question your ability as a parent You can't do anything you can't make it better to see my little girl With therapy I became better and then about four months ago is when it hit me the hardest it's ever hit me before I just, I felt so bad about myself I didn't, I didn't like who I was, I, I didn't know how to bring myself out of it and We felt helpless. We didn't know which way to turn and nothing was working and music found her. Being here today is incredible. I remember I, I couldn't step out of bed. I didn't wanna face the world and now I'm facing thousands of people This could mean the world to me, to see her out there, and we're rooting for her You know Personally I also have an anxiety disorder I suffer from OCD People don't really know what it takes, and how much suffering it is for you to even show up today is so amazing There isn't anybody alive that at some time doesn't need help in coping and the world is here for you And I just want to hear what you have to offer us so Just play and pretend like you're alone in your room and nobody's watching Okay?

consistent with a century you're living in quite a certain man feel the need to dress up as mythic figures you don't see anyone walking around a pirate costume do you when's the last guy you ran into

some dick some yo-yo some putz with a camcorder and he is going to tape everything doesn't anyone in this country just stop and look at things anymore sort of take them in maybe even remember them is that just a strange notion does that does experience have to be documented and brought home and saved on the show and do people really watch this shit our peoples live so bankrupt they sit at home looking at things they already did these guys are so intense you know it's always guys they won't let women touch the cameras it's a highly technical skill look through a hole push on a button big skill in there they all think they're federico fellini everything low angle zooms and pans and it's the same ugly three children and every goddamn shot all the George Lucas magic in Hollywood is not going to change the unfortunate genetic configuration on the faces of these children keep these unfortunate youngsters out of public view now a lot of these policy a lot of these cultural crimes have been complaining about can be blamed on the baby boomers something else I'm a little tired of hearing about the baby boomers whining narcissistic self-indulgent people with a simple philosophy giving it it's mine give me that it's mine these people were given everything everything was handed to them and they took it all took it all sex drugs and rock and roll and they stayed loaded for 20 years and had a free ride but now they're staring down the barrel of middle-aged burnout and they don't like it they don't like it so they turn self-righteous and they want to make things hard on younger people they tell them I've stain from sex say no to drugs as for the rock and roll they sold that for television commercials a long time ago so they could buy pasta machines and stairmasters and soybean  you know something  the cold bloodless people it's in their slogans it's in their rhetoric no pain no gain just do it life is short play hard shit happens deal with it get a life these people went from do your own thing to just say no they went from love is all you need to whoever winds up with the most toys wins and they went from cocaine to Rogaine  and you know something they're still counting grams only now it's fat grades worse of it is the rest of us have to watch these commercials on TV for Levi's loose-fitting jeans and fat ass docker pants because these degenerate yuppie boomer cocksuckers couldn't keep their hands off the croissants and the haagen-dazs and your big fat asses have spread all over and they have to wear fat-ass docker pants fuck these boomers fuck these yuppies and fuck everybody now that I think of it  sometimes in comedy you have to generalize now there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about politicians everybody complains about politicians everybody says they suck well where do people think these politicians come from they don't fall out of the sky they don't pass through a membrane from another reality they come from American parents and American families American homes American schools American churches American businesses and American universities and they're elected by American citizens this is the best we can do folks this is what we have to offer it's what our system produces garbage in garbage out if you have selfish ignorant citizens if you have selfish ignorant citizens you're going to get selfish ignorant leaders the term limits ain't going to be any good you're just going to wind up with a brand-new bunch of selfish ignorant Americans so maybe maybe maybe it's not the politicians who suck maybe something else sucks around here like the public yeah the public sucks there's a nice campaign slogan for somebody the public sucks fuck hope fuck hope because if it's really just a fault of these politicians then where are all the other bright people of conscience where are all the bright honest intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way we don't have people like that this country everybody's at the mall scratching his ass picking his nose taking his credit card out of his fanny pack and buying a pair of sneakers with likes in them so I have solved this little political dilemma for myself in a very simple way on election day I stay home I don't vote fucking fucking I don't vote two reasons two reasons I don't vote first of all it's meaningless this country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago the shit they shuffle around every four years doesn't mean a fucking thing and secondly I don't vote because I believe if you vote you have no right to complain people like to twist that around I know they say they say well if you don't vote you have no right to complain where's the logic in that if you vote and you elect dishonest incompetent people and they get into office and screw everything up well you are responsible for what they have done you caused the problem you voted them in you have no right to complain I on the other hand who did not vote who did not vote who in fact did not even leave the house on Election Day I'm in no way responsible for what these people have done and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with so I know that a little later on this year you're going to have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so much you'll enjoy yourselves it'll be a lot of fun I'm sure as soon as the election is over your country will improve immediately as for me I'll be home on that day doing essentially the same thing as you the only difference is when I could finish masturbating I'm going to have a little something to show for it folks thank you very much", "MppMQYCwiIY": "rise and fall of Henry Hill the real good fella has violence and strong language from the start [Music] [Applause] [Music] at the age of 12 my ambition was to be a gangster to me being a wiseguy was better than being president United States to be a wiseguy was to own the world [Music]  this is Henry Hill Henry spent half his life running with one of the most violent mafia gangs in America having to do whatever was asked of him to survive his life in the mob was made infamous by Martin Scorsese's gangster classic Goodfellas Goodfellas is widely regarded as the most unflinching portrayal of life in the Mafia ever made and this scene of a brutal mob slaying actually happened in front of Henry Hill what Henry witnessed will haunt him for the rest of his life we used to turn my fucking stomach you know hey I mean I lived in fear every fucking day in my life but Henry's real life in the mob was far more vicious than Goodfellas could ever betray it's extraordinary I don't know what kind of a person makes you become I was fucked I was literally fucked you know I mean and where the movie ends the darkest part of Henry's life began that's when life really became insane in a bid to save his own life Henry became a government informant and betrayed his childhood friends the Mafia issued a multi-million dollar contract on his life they were not gonna take this lying down they were gonna look for Henry and they were gonna look to have him executed it's not a way to live I mean he might as well be dead this is the whole story of Henry Hill told by the few that survived why I'm still here why I'm around heck I don't know I get those guardian angels on my shoulder the sons you know for some reason this is Pine Street Brooklyn New York childhood home to Henry Hill during the 1950's this was a thriving tight-knit immigrant community it was a middle-class blue-collar neighborhood everybody knew everybody on a fucking block and you know they know everybody's cousins and uncles and we're fucked they came from me Henry was one of seven siblings born to an Italian mother and a hard-working Irish father I felt that a place at home and I was always getting in trouble I mean I could never do the right fucking thing they would do things that would invoke me anger with my father used to keep this year rules fucking fine and but I decided that you know I mean I really did I mean sometimes I used to do it to spite him you know I mean just a fucking spider Henry felt equally distanced at school where undiagnosed learning difficulties gave him an outsider status dyslexia hyperactivity ADHD attention deficit disorder these weren't diagnosed they thought I was a fucking goof off you know I mean they thought I was doing it on purpose I mean I couldn't fucking leave it would have been a rare person who would have risen above those things and Henry wasn't that rare person there were elements in his family life there were problems with his father and I think to a certain extent he looked for his father two other men men who behave differently when a cabstand run by Paul Vario high-ranking member of a mob family opened across the street Henry was transfixed across the street from my house you know with the fuckin Cadillacs and diamond rings and then fuckin $100 bills and bimbos on each arm and yeah I mean it was it was a toxic ad for whatever reason I guess because of Henry's charm they they took a shine towards him and they patted me on a fuckin back and gave me for the five intense and that day you know you know the fifties that was a lot of fuckin money he became a member of the crew just as the movie shows when he was when he was a young kid at 13 I was making more money than most of the grown-ups in the neighborhood I mean I had more money than I could spend I had it all one day one day some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home you know why it was at a respect behind him infernal erupts as if he's in hell basically because that's where he's going ultimately when he first started earning money and he would tried to give gifts to my mother and my father they would never be accepted not one dollar so he would try to demean well I make more in a week than you make all year you know during a holdup a robbery or whatever these things broke my parents harmed I thought it was a fucking game you know here take this fucking pistol shooter shooter I fucking won to a couple of times you know yeah I mean it was exciting you know it was it was intoxicating [Music] Henry didn't realize he was becoming involved in one of the New York mafias most violent cruise run by Paul Vario a capo or captain in the Lucchese crime family he treated me better than he treated his own sons I mean I love the guy you know I mean I did you know I did Paul Vario was probably one of most frightening people I've ever been around he had an aura of Menace about him that was quite remarkable with the Paul Sorvino characterization didn't pick it up at all in Goodfellas Paul Vario was played by Paul Sorvino the portrayal was of a brooding fatherly figure in reality very Oh was capable of acts of brutal violence it was on these streets that varriya would reveal his true nature to an impressionable Henry husband 13 12 13 years old and touch the fucking baseball bat at it back in the fucking car walks in a fucking bar and I could see it you know somewhere I was he starts hitting the fucking bomb he was fucking baseball bat I mean beating the shit of this fucking woman you know look a fucking collarbone she she had it on him that he was going out with it you know his fucking wife is some bullshit yeah I was just no stupid shit like that but I mean to fire holy fuck was a you know I I never seen that part of him you know I did you know at that point you know and then I started realizing he's fucking as a fucking gangster yeah I mean you know but you know I kind of knew when I eat you know I didn't want to know I knew what I don't want to know you know what I mean I didn't want to see it sometimes I had to see it you know once I crossed that line as a kid I don't want to go back I was a spoiled always greedy you know I you know I think back sometimes you know why you know why why did I stay through Paul Vario Henry would befriend Jimmy Burke a gangster far more unstable and psychotic than Goodfellas could ever show the film actually kind of softened him up I wouldn't want to see what he was capable of you put it that way together they would pull off an audacious heist that would finally earn Henry the underworld respect he craved it's my fuckin misfits my payday  this is Henry Hill his early life in the Mafia was the basis for Martin Scorsese's gangster classic Goodfellas you know it's very hard for people in that world to make a straight living it's very hard for them to do it and it's like it's like an addiction craving money and power a teenage Henry Hill had chosen to run with one of the most violent mafia gangs in New York run by Paul Vario a capo in the Lucchese crime family it's a very evil environment where people are concerned about what their next score is gonna be and when they're gonna get killed through very oh he'll would meet two of the most psychotic gangsters in New York far more brutal than the movie could ever portray Italian was just a fuckin loose horse fucking homicidal fucking maniac while showing Henry that path to underworld respect they wouldn't wrench him in a violent life that he would never escape  maybe fuckin that was yesterday more than I did yesterday you know what I mean and they were just sucking me you know not you know but I mean I you know I I just didn't know the word no you know what I mean whatever I was if sedated sensing his inevitable fate hill made his first of two ultimately doomed attempts to escape the clutches of the Mafia I figured fuck it you know let me join the army maybe he's fuckin people leave me to fuck alone you know what I mean on June the 11th 1960 Henry Hill joined the u.s. paratroopers stationed in Fort Bragg North Carolina 500 miles away from varios crew it was sort of a feeble attempt that he would make periodically throughout his life to distance himself from this this gangster way of life I made it was bored with that fucking shit you know I mean you know I was ready to move on in my life and didn't know how however and his life of crime was already far too ingrained it's very hard for people in that world to live what you would say more straight existence I got a lot of trouble you had a couple court-martials you know drinking and just fucking carrying on fighting the Marines he started to resume some of his criminal activities that he learned in Brooklyn such as gambling shylocking he was lending people money after spending two months in a military stockade for fighting and stealing a sheriff's car private Hill was discharged from the US Army  when he had a bed run with the army he went back to the welcoming arms of the Vario crew and he found a home there it was right there you know and they'd be always glad to see me come home and you know then it was then it was a lot different you know I mean then it was it was it was the real fucking deal Henri's returned to mafia life was sealed when he met Jimmy Burke played by Robert De Niro in Goodfellas however De Niro didn't betray the true brutality of the real Jimmy Burke  he was a maniac he was a fucking maniac and people know that they couldn't cross that fucking line when you cross that fuckin line whenever you were dead and you didn't get a second chance you know he he gestured a fucking death you know take it at dinner and then fucking kill you you know for dessert Irina's that was Jimmy with his fearsome reputation Burke was Hills ticket to money and underworld respect somebody like Jimmy the gent was a terrific mentor he would teach you how to pull burglaries robberies big holdups how to deal in cocaine how to deal in heroin he knew the ropes no matter what it was I mean if it was fucking deal in stocks and bonds or fucking not hijacking a truck or fucking whacking somebody you know I mean Jimmy he had the answers period in the Mafia the key to respect was earning big money and Jimmy Burke showed Henry the way when he introduced him to JFK Airport when Burke was finally arrested he was flying in a plane over JFK Airport he looked down he smiled I said one day all that was mine  by the early 1960s over 30 billion dollars worth of freight was passing through Kennedy Airport every year Burke tort held the art of hijacking that cargo Jimmy's main thing was hijacking trucks enter here porting it sometimes we still to fucking charge three trucks a fucking day a today you know and we have warehouse and we have fucking forklifts and we had fucking I mean we had it out to a fuckin science hijacking Airport cargo had become such a problem that the US government made a film warning freight companies of the Mafia the hijackers easily ply their trade and too often successfully avoid apprehend so I guess lost one of my trucks in Brooklyn the film was too little too late the mafia already had a vice-like grip over the airport with people at every level on the payroll we're the fucking shop stores the fuckin you know bosses and fucking Union you know they were fuck it was all connected I mean the drivers knew they were getting hijacked the hijackers knew the drivers sometimes are even related and those who couldn't be bribed were forced into silence through intimidation they got away with it because people were afraid people were terrified they were literally fuck seriously what are you get killed they find them in the fucking trunk of a car somewhere once Hill had mastered the art of hijacking trucks Berg helped him plan a heist that made him in the eyes of the Mafia it was a major deal and I think that in that sense Henry earned respect in 1968 he'll learn through an airport insider that half a million dollars in cash was being stored at the Air France Depot at Kennedy Airport but there was a problem he'll informed his mentor Jimmy Burke about a straight-shooting guard who stood in between them and the cash together they hatched a plan to relieve the guard of his keys the way they did it they spent many weeks looking over the guy who was in charge of this operation and found out what his weaknesses were and as I recall his weakness was pornography and prostitutes after getting the guard very drunk Ellen Burke drove him to a motel where the hooker they had hired it was waiting because the guard hasn't a clue and he takes his pants off and then so of course boom they pull the keys make a copy of the key put the keys back in the guy's pants so he goes back to work the next day but they have the key to the Air France safe on the 8th of April 1968 Henry Hill stole over $400,000 from Air France including fucking carrier fuckers suitcases out I was clean as a whistle huh [Music] the Air France heist was headline news obeying mafia law Henri split the hole with a very oh group there is no greater gift you can give one of those guys than a half a million dollars in stolen money when he talks in that business and if Henry was going out and sharing the loot with with others and they were gonna respect them I mean that just sealed it you know I mean I matter where to fuck I want you know they were just you know fucking write copy for meto you know the Air France job and Henry the underworld respect it craved since adolescence and with respect came the keys to the city we could do any fucking thing we want us to do in an old fucking city I mean we owned a city I mean we were princes of the city we want no matter where the fuck we went you can go anywhere it's like a magic carpet you just go anywhere he wants and I could fly for the world Henry showcased his newfound wealth of the notorious mob hangout the Copacabana to be able to go to the Copacabana this was a major major had a I think Asian go sit down at the fucking tailor Nicole Prince Sammy Davis come home and sit down I transfer you and snatch it yeah come over to the fucking table for Tuesday you know I mean it was it was fucking was chaotic Henry was riding high but when he met Karen played by Lorraine Bracco in Goodfellas he was forced to question his mobster lifestyle she didn't know what he did in the beginning you know she knew that you know I kind of you know I thought I was a union delegate you know she was apart from that world that I was in with  Henry and Karin married and moved to this leafy suburb in Long Island now Henry made his final attempt to escape the clutches of the Vario crew it was another way of trying to fucking you know insulate myself from those fucking lunatics that you know then I was partners with him you know desperate to become legitimate and report the sweet a supper club in Queens New York it looked for a moment like he might actually become a restaurant to her and a bar owner that lasted just a matter of months he just couldn't he was drawn back in and just fuckin followed me you know and the place you know to play survived and became fuckin headquarters within months the suite was a mob hangout full of the people Henry had tried to escape one of the regulars was Tommy disa Muni played by Joe Pesci in Goodfellas Tommy was just a fucking loose horse fucking homicidal fucking maniac you know the film actually fucking you know kind of softened him up it gave him enjoyment to break somebody's wrist murder somebody beat him up with a bat yeah he was actually a psycho and then you know he was strung around constantly Tommy would end Henry's attempt to go legit by committing a savage murder inside his club one night it was really late and a guy by the name of Billy batts was in there he was a made organized crime figure very important kind of guy Jimmy and Ty he's just fuck him beat his fuckin head in with it you know there was an area where slave boy you knowing Tommy beat him so fucking hard at the pistol fall apart instead [Music]  [Music] [Applause]  in Goodfellas the hit was over a petty argument but in reality this vicious murder was over an ongoing turf ooh there was a be story there that never was shown in Goodfellas Billy batts had just come home from prison he had all the Shylock business they had the bookmaking business and Jimmy you know when he was the way Jimmy took it all over basically and Jimmy knew he had to kill him eventually they crossed the line that unfortunately is just no coming back and somebody's gonna have to pay for it Billy batts was a made man a fully initiated member of the Mafia the penalty for killing a made man was death to ensure the body was never found they threw bats into the trunk of Hills car and drove to Pennsylvania to dig his grave on the journey Hill made a chilling discovery bats wasn't dead it was sickening it was fucking sickening it was actually sickening you know you fuckin shot you know he looked at me he says Henry they didn't actually shoot him they just write the time just dead 30 or 40 fuckin time fucker Harnam that ended Henry's ever being able to walk away it was over I mean the suite was God he was now the participant in a homicide and his bond now was to those with whom he had done the homicide I was always there to do I had to do but yet you know he used to turn my fucking stomach you know hey I mean I lived in fear every fucking day my life you know IIIi I did you know I mean I I was no I didn't like the violence involved but you know if I showed any sign of weakness I know I get fucking killed Henry's dreams of escaping were over he was back working in various crew having to do whatever was asked of him to survive in 1972 a seemingly innocuous trip to Florida would result in his first incarceration ultimately they just do one thing too many they think they're gonna get away with it no he and Jimmy went down to Florida to pick up some money that was oh there was somebody had had owed a lot of money to some organized crime guys and we snatched a man in a fuckin bar and beat the fuck every night smack the shit out of mr. Lipton my recollection is that we later found out the facts of that case and that they had changed somebody behind a car and dragged them for a good a good space and but to Henry that was just smacking somebody around a little bit he paid the fucking money next day but his sister work for the FBI we didn't know that [Music] on November the 3rd 1972 following a successful FBI investigation Henry and Jimmy Burke each received ten years in federal prison on charges of interstate gambling and assault fucking you know no big fucking deal you know ten years under six years you know that's Toby Young when I got out sure enough yeah and then fucking prison was a fucking joke you know when you think of prison here's your love you get pictures in your mind of all those old movies with bows and Mo's of guys behind bars but it wasn't like that for wiseguys it really wasn't that bad something that I miss Jimmy he was doing his time in Atlanta right I mean everybody else in the joint was doing real time all mixed together living like pigs but we lived alone we give the impression of it being breezier than it was to add to the irony of it with the music that's playing and that sort of thing and getting a lobster's but this was what we had guards who told us this is the reality to him it was all there it's all there I mean a certain people who were privileged Hills privileges were paid for by bribing the guards and that meant earning on the inside  Hill turned to fellow inmate Paul Massey who showed him how much money could be made dealing narcotics Dave's a joke to us you fuckers stupid fucks you fucking around with trailer trucks will fucking give you two shoeboxes full of fucking heroin and it's ten times as much money as you make off ten fucking trailers you know that starts to eat away and money always corrupts um corrupts the corrupted it was a turning point for Henry by selling narcotics he'll was breaking a sacred mafia edict that was punishable by death the reason that they had the it is up because they have anymore compunctions about the use of narcotics or selling narcotics it's because the experience going back to the 50s and 60s is that drug deal is turned on the higher-ups and they were in the higher-ups in the in the organized crime families wanted to ensure they wouldn't be the victims of their underlings who got caught selling drugs it was  it was too easy Henry was now concealing his part in Billy batts death and his drug dealing from his mob bosses and he was getting hooked on the drugs he was secretly selling a high life was slipping away I was fucked don't smoothly fucked you know I mean  near months after his release from prison Hill would become involved in the biggest cash robbery ever committed on American soil that's what life really became in steep what should have been his defining moment would mutate into an orgy of violence murder and ultimately betrayal I was a dead man walking handle it  by the time Henry Hill was released from prison his life in the Mafia was spiraling out of control that's when life really became insane he had been involved in the execution of initiated Mafia member Billy batts and had started dealing drugs he knew when the Mafia finally found out he was a dead man you're gonna call me welcome my wife become a kid and in 1978 Hill and mafia mentor Jimmy Burke pulled off the notorious Lufthansa heist a robbery that spawned a vicious killing spree and ultimately led to Henry Hills cold-hearted betrayal of them all you didn't get me motherfucker I got you  on Sunday the 11th of December 1978 Jimmy Burke screw acting on a tip-off from Henry Hill pulled off the largest cash robbery ever committed on American soil five heavily armed masked men the day fled with an estimated three million dollars in cash and $300,000 in jewelry from the Lufthansa Airlines Cargo hangar at New York's Kennedy Airport the robbery was front-page news across America the actual figure stolen would rise to five million dollars in cash and a million dollars in jewels the news of the robbery was not only on the radio but it was television of course the tabloids splashed across the front page and it was it was huge news everybody in the fucking City knew was us the whole fucking I mean there wasn't a wise guy that didn't know that we didn't do it you know I mean and it fucking feds or to within a day or two law enforcement knew for sure based on what their informants were telling him that it was Jimmy Burke screw that it carried out the robbery the FBI's first breakthrough was the discovery of the van used in the robbery driven by stacks Edwards he was supposed to get rid of the fucking van they found his fucking finger prints on it before the FBI could interrogate stacks Burke had him executed the killing spree had begun it was very hard to develop evidence in the Lufthansa case because people who were involved started turning out dead the FBI put the entire Vario crew under surveillance it wasn't long before they started giving themselves away by showing off their newfound wealth stupid ma I mean guys would fucking IQs up you know 26 a fucking going buy fucking new Cadillacs fucking before it does not mean colds and shit and little by little men who showed off that they had the money were killed he's just trying to eliminate everybody and he had to because people were gonna fucking nuts  fucking three-month period 12 fucking guys one life they found toss off the fucking bone up on a fucking be some mock away  one of them wild up getting killed and hung up in an ice truck and use frozen stiff  it took three days from the body to thought so they could give it an autopsy I can remember one in particular who he brought into the strike force told him that the FBI had informed information that he was going to be killed and he listened politely and looked at both of us and said can I go and he did and he walked out and his body parts washed up several weeks later within months Jimmy Burke with Paul varios blessing had slaughtered everyone involved in the heist Henry Hill was the last man standing I've seen him running on a fucking war you know I didn't have no way out you know I mean I was fucked I was literally fucked you know what I mean Henry knew Jimmy wanted him dead he had to find a way out you know from you know from having fucking life you know on easy street you know you know three or four restaurants I got a fucking million dollars cash you know I ain't had a wonder it you know what a few restaurants now I'm in a fucking heroin business throughout the Lufthansa killing spree Henry had become heavily involved in narcotics trafficking he knew that his mafia boss Paul Vario would order his death if he ever got caught we knew he was involved in the sale and distribution of heroin cocaine quaaludes any number of different electrics  Hills drug-dealing had attracted the attention of the Nassau County Police Department who placed him under surveillance with Vario Burke the FBI and the police closing in amazingly he would find a way to make his problems even worse very quickly he began to snore the heroin became addicted to heroin became addicted to cocaine and his judgment was pretty cloudy in those days he wound up putting a lot of drugs out on the street and think he'd paid for I couldn't remember who half the time who we gave what to I got some fucking wack and drugs I mean not why cami I was able to function but I was you know strung out on you fucking name and I was thrown out on it the anxiety and the pressure that he's feeling I think are really so evident the way Scorsese shot the scene  [Music]  I was gonna be busy all day and I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he a gun now to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him back to the house for dinner that night and then I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta but got more and more control yeah there's no way he's gonna get is gonna slamming up against the walls everything's gonna crash he was totally fucking insane totally fucking insane he had eluded us in so many different directions and I was ready for it to be over finally after 41 days of surveillance Nassau County Police Department swooped and arrested Henry Hill he got caught he got caught the guy who thought he would never get caught they'll get you Henry was taken in for questioning but the police hadn't found any drugs the stroke of luck they were looking for came in the shape of Henry's girlfriend and drug partners relaxed approach to domestic hygiene they went in the fucking house and it's fucking vacuum cleaning fucking walls I was fucking heroin coke is that you're gonna stay hard for fucking ages with his shit was on a wallpaper eater and I said gotcha with overwhelming evidence against him Henry Hill was facing 25 years to life in prison  and he was a marked man his drug dealing meant Vario wanted him dead and former friend Jimmy Burke knew that as the last man alive with inside knowledge of the Lufthansa heist Henry could leave the feds to his door nobody at that point had any faith that Henry was gonna keep its mouth shut I knew Paul would want to whack me Jimmy was gonna whack me you know it was it was it was so fucking crazy you know he could have counted the days before he was killed but the FBI offered Henry a way out in return for his inside information on the Lufthansa heist he would receive immunity on the drugs charges so he was an easy case I mean that he was facing 5-7 life sentences Henry had no option but to break the most important mafia rule of all never rat on your friends he loathed himself for having turned because his entire life had been based in a world where becoming a rat is the worst thing you could possibly be cause you becoming her you know what I mean I'm fucking stool pigeon and you know I mean I just couldn't even fantasize you know I did there was a time in my life that I would have put a fucking gun in my fucking mouth and even with my fucking brains out before I become a fucking rat on the 22nd of May 1980 Henry Hill agreed to cooperate with the FBI this is where the movie Goodfellas ends but where a 25 year mafia manhunt and Henry's descent into self-destruction began ill and his family were moved by the US Marshals to Omaha Nebraska to begin their new lives in the witness protection program first night he was in the program and lying in his house in absolute silence in the dark he said sippy I was scared out of my mind not that the guys from New York were gonna gonna come get me it's it's I can't do this normal thing what's the culture shock I mean seriously it was [Music] they cured her back in his big yummy any talk fucker funny you know he did you I mean I get different country Henry have to assume a new identity that would enable him to travel back to New York to begin his debriefing he chose Martin Lewis insurance adjuster and be gone all the time investigating an arson in fucking Boston and you know I just that you know [Music]  in New York Hill began his debriefing about the Lufthansa robbery so the FBI could finally get to Jimmy Burke and Paul Vario but his free-roaming testimony inadvertently incriminating other mafia members you know I just told fucking truth and every time I told the truth it opened another fucking can of worms and you know and it started an under investigation and another fucking case and I had no idea that this was going on we were able to make some significant cases and develop all sorts of other evidence that led to other investigations and prosecutions yeah well you know you understand I'm gonna make that fucking deal with you guys well you don't want to fuck a stand you know Hill was forced to take the witness stand and come face to face with the mafia bosses he was betraying it was tough I mean looking at these fucking guys you know I mean these bosses of bosses and shit you know they were absolutely the highest quality targets that we had in the most difficult cases that we had and Henry was was an extraordinarily valuable witness he did his job for the feds I mean he showed up in the courts in New York came back many times and was invaluable in breaking down a huge gang empire in New York Henry's testimony helped convict over 50 mafia members they were not gonna take this lying down they were gonna look for Henry and they were gonna look to have him executed back in Omaha Henry began to spiral out of control part of him wanted to mess up and punished himself so he was becoming extremely self-destructive I couldn't live with myself I stay gabbatha Stoll isn't fucking enjoying it every night you know me he was a total coke freak pill freak I mean he was on everything that he could take he would ingest anything in between trials the FBI was continuing to debrief hill about Lufthansa as he was the last surviving witness we were running through the robbery and where he was during the robbery and Henry said while I was in Pittsburgh adder I said well what were you doing in Pittsburgh and Henry kind of smiled his little smile and said well you're not gonna like this three years before his arrest Henry Hill and Jimmy Burke were fixing basketball games at Boston College ironically the team Ed McDonald used to play for I said you know you're completely nuts I said you got a real serious problem here motherfucker almost leapt over the fucking table try to grab me but you are music together Burke and Hill had bribed three players to fix the results of basketball games including starting center Rick Kuhn who was dragged in front of the US courts with Kuhn and Hills testimony the FBI could finally bring Burke to trial Burke was arrested suspected of murdering at least 50 people the mastermind of the Lufthansa robbery would face trial on a seemingly innocuous gambling scam  and on the 27th of October 1981 began the u.s. versus Jimmy Burke the courtroom was packed with media with organized crime figures and with people who were interested in the case Henry Hill would once again have to take the stand this time against his former mafia mentor I mean look at him you know what I knew that this motherfucker ordered my death you know I mean before the trial the FBI played he'll wiretap evidence of Burke ordering his execution I didn't believe him you know I mean and they played me the fucking tape I mean most station up you know I mean when a cops I go over my death you know I know what I mean yeah I mean that's that's that's what it became and I mean Henry was ruthless and he was a cornered rat and while he might have been uncomfortable testifying against these people he recognized that these people who were looking to kill him I was able to look with cocksuckin II I you know I mean I said Jimmy you didn't get me motherfucker I got you Jimmy Burke was convicted and would spend the rest of his life in prison at the end at the end I was just you know disposable I was just you know they were gonna kill me Hales testimony would be equally damaging to Paul Vario on trial for extortion at Kennedy Airport put his fucking head down you know fuck it we didn't kill you cocksucker yeah you got us yeah I got it motherfucker yeah you even got my wife and my fucking kids motherfucker you know I knew what they were capable of you know I mean I've seen it all my life born Henry's testimony helped convict Paul Vario he was sentenced to a total of 12 and a half years in Pittsburgh federal penitentiary  behind bars Jimmy Burke organized a relentless campaign to have hell found and executed he would have been just mutilated for what he had done Henry Hill would spend the next 25 years running for his life  in 1980 Henry Hill became a government informant betraying his childhood friends Jimmy Burke and Paul Vario condemning them to spend the rest of their lives behind bars I beat him to the punch you know I mean I did Burke had issued a multi-million dollar contract on Henry Hills life there would be plenty of takers don't wanna coming welcome my wife or my kids you know I mean anything to get to me they would all love to make their bones killing Henry Hill  [Applause] Henry Hill had been secretly moved to Omaha Nebraska and placed in the witness protection program to safeguard him from mafia reprisals they looked out for me I mean Damon what the fuck it was it was a big fucking deal back in 1980 you know being a rat you know I was the first fucking okay it was clearly in a great deal of danger his family was in a great deal of danger in 1981 through a government informant the FBI received the news they have been dreading Burke was closing in Burke had some buddies he told them where dree was allegedly at they notified us so we don't take chances we moved about  fun right show some clothes in your fucking bag we'll be there we're outside right now I believe he had about 24 hours gotta go throughout the ages he'll and his family were moved repeatedly by the US government the threat of mafia execution was ever-present he was in a great deal of danger and has contributed in many ways to his alcoholism and his drug addiction he became highly addicted to cocaine and heroin you name it and Henry's drug addiction was about to lead him into the arms of the Mafia  in the mid-1980s Henry Hill had been moved to Washington with a serious addiction and mounting debts he returned to his life of narcotics dealing and in Washington Hill fell foul of an undercover police sting hey look I was a fucking captain midnite Menem Darren I you know he was a fuckin agent I knew it and I couldn't convince these other fucking assholes you know I need dough with him go pump Henry Hill was arrested on narcotics charges worse still he had lost his witness protection status through seven years of continually breaking every rule in the program the witness protection program failed in my view for Henry because Henry is a weak person he wasn't able to to discipline himself and to to change his life passing bad checks and calling home back to New York you know which was a no-no that was forbidden don't use the phone go fuck yourself you know I mean fuck addy it's not so much that the program failed Henry is that Henry failed himself and his usefulness for the government at that point is pretty much at an end he had already given up everything he had to offer to negotiate he had nothing left it was a strong case he went the trial he was convicted things couldn't have been worse for Hill awaiting sentencing he was sent to Terminal Island in California a prison populated with mafia inmates when he arrived he found out that there were members of the East Coast mafia who were who knew who he was and what he had done to their guys back east they were doing time then you know then we don't life sentences and fucking 20 years and also that fucker shit or they did try to kill me two attempts were made on Hills life and though his usefulness to the government was over ed MacDonald came to his rescue one last time I wrote a letter because I thought it was only fair to talk about the the convictions and the cases that he had contributed to the judge waived the letter in front of the prosecutor and said that because of what Henry had done and because of the pressures that he was under he was going to sentence him to a probationary sentence I had a lunar year any job we had and he sent me just fucking in a place where I you know supposedly got rehabilitated  finally Hale received some good news wise guy his autobiography co-written with Nick Pileggi was to be made into a Hollywood movie Scorsese caught me movie get the fucker yeah yeah yeah he's gonna give me half a million dollars I said okay not a fucking payday you know hey seriously every fucking made Henry had to work hard for his money Robert De Niro constantly phoned him for advice on how to perfect his portrayal of Jimmy Burke ironically the man who wanted Henry dead he's on a fucking phone constantly I mean you know they fucking seven eight times a day he wouldn't leave his fucking chill when I brought him to me twice you know Jimmy needed how did you mean hold the cigarette ha I thought he was a fucking nut job when filming had finished and De Niro had left Henry alone he was smuggled onto the Warner Brothers lot for a secret screening of Goodfellas I mean how could you imagine yourself you know on a fucking big silver screen you know I mean and no and it was me yeah I mean this fucking kid Neal  I had a lot of fun I had you know a lot of money you know what fucking you know insane fucking shit but yet at the end of the fucking night you know I still worked Christian power throughout the making of Goodfellas the threats on Hills life and his life on the run continued but the main threat ended on the 13th of April 1996 when Jimmy Burke died of lung cancer in prison it was a fucking relief you know I mean in the same with Paulie when he died you know it was a fucking relief because I knew well Paul Henne wouldn't kill me you know I mean poorly undercover I know Jimmy doing yeah on this fucking dead bed I'm sure that he said yeah make sure you get fucking him yeah I knew Jimmy from Burke died that was the end of the fear of New York but that was far from the end of his problems today Henry Hill lives in the Midwest he and Karen are divorced the money from Goodfellas is spent and he makes a living as a chef in a small Italian restaurant for the most part he never breaks a promise unless it has to do with alcohol and if it has to do with alcohol he'll break it I'll say just this fucking moment I mean yeah I don't like being sober I don't I've heard him that many times all I really want to be from here on out is the best damn drunk in the world he is plagued by his addictions and haunted by his former life living a lifestyle where he lived by a code and broke it I'm sure came into it he also continues his life of crime this last deal he goes through the security at the airport with drugs and his carry-on bag I mean how dumb is it I think what you see of every today it's what you'll see of the rest of his life he'll be in a trouble I don't believe he get up and turn his back on it is it possible that Henry will find redemption and walk the straight and narrow you know stranger things have happened he's getting near the end now and it's quite possible that as he likes it his final days you might get religion but I wouldn't bet on it I'm fucking sick as it sounds you know and as fucked up as my life wasn't is and is gonna be and probably fucking there I died but I don't hurt [Music]", "GvVVq2Wa1y4": "hello hey ho how are you I'm very well thank you what's your name my name is Stevie pink and how old is Stevie I'm 42 and is this your

up to get married I had four children then when did you pick up dancing I went to live in Spain with my husband and unfortunately after 18 months he died and for something to do I went to Nico's Dance Academy to learn something totally different and this is the result [Applause] [Music] my grandmother is 93 years old and I just kept thinking of her when you were being thrown around that that man and I think she would have wanted me to press my buzzer for you as well so me and my nan are going to be right behind you and I hope you win Britain's Got Talent [Music] [Applause]  the fact that you did it for all those years and then and then had your lovely children then lost your husband you gave up so much but when I started to do this I spoke with the family and I said what do you think and they said well you gave everything up to have us we were bout to dad and he would be proud yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how do you are my hero like you are unbelievable I pray to God that I am like you when I'm your age I don't want to sound patronizing but we have to just say it as it is that is something I've never seen before I'm so pleased demanders presto [Applause] you", "YlaWGd1cUms": "Good night Welcome to America Jot Talent You are !!!! you! Do you have a name? Sticky tape !! what are you up to ?? you do not know !!! What is that ?! Maybe we will talk later? !! Probably! Well, I like mystery Show and do what you came to do", "pni_kDv9BsU": "good morning I recognize what we're gonna talk about this morning is a little bit different than what you guys usually think about as you're doing your daily jobs and things like that but you know Lizzie and Shireen both mentioned a little a minute ago that everybody lies right I mean you all probably been lied to in the past maybe even told a lie or two in the past do I have anybody in the room is gonna tell me they never lie no one okay that's good at least I don't see anyone with the lights on would it surprise you if I told you actually let's do a little experiment first I want you to find someone in the room and I want you to point at them I know it's rude but I want you to point at them and as you're pointing I'm going to point at you who are you Aaron I'm gonna point at Aaron so find someone in the room point at them and then look around to see who is staring at you who's pointing at you okay so then I'm gonna hold your hand up and with this being five and this being zero I want you to end up like everybody to do this for just a moment with this being this big zero this being five tell me how many times you think that person has lied in the last 24 hours okay now look around the room and just just look around the room and see what people are doing and saying okay look around the room okay you put your hands down you can put your hands down let me start by saying you guys are really really polite group because I saw a lot of these I saw a couple of these few of these I didn't have any flashers though normally I do this trainee I got people with both hands flashing they take their shoes off that they could talk about how many times they think people had lied all right would it surprise you if I told you that a person lies an average of ten times a day okay now I know some of you sitting there going no no that's not true I don't like 10 times a day but think about it for just a moment when I talk about lying 10 times a day I'm talking about things like somebody asking how you're doing and you have a splitting headache and you say fine because you don't want to get into it all right so when I talk about lies I'm talking about a complete range from those little white lies that we tell either not to hurt someone's feelings or to keep a conversation from going in a direction we don't want it to go in to those really big bold-faced lies where I didn't do it okay why is this important to you guys why is knowing what a lie looks like to you is important to you whether you're hiring employees you know whether you got a screening process going whether you have an investigation because someone's been stealing from your company and you need to put yourself in an investigative mindset now any of those things that you touch as executives and retail or folks that are involved in retail it's important if you're a buyer and you're going out looking to see if you're getting the best deal on the things that you're looking to buy do you want to know if that's persons telling you the truth or do you want to know if you have a little bit more wiggle room so the purpose of teaching you about lying today and I'm not going to tell you everything about it because we don't have all day but I'm going to touch on the things that are most important to you and I hope that you'll find that they do have something to do with what you guys do on a day to day basis okay if I forget to say this and I usually do I want to say it before I leave when you finish this 45 minutes with me you're gonna be dangerous you're gonna know just enough to be dangerous all right so don't take this home and use it on your significant others not gonna lead you where you want to go children however use it all the time on kids all right I have a 16 year old son if his lips are moving he's lying all right so just setting you up with that so let's get into this just a little bit about me I think they told you it's all over the place actually I am former CIA I still do a lot of work with them but the point is is it's in the CIA that I learned what it looks like when people are lying I have a master's in forensic psychology and education I spent over 20 years with the agency developed a screening program with inside the agency and we actually take this program this to spy the live program all over the world and teach people about lying all over the world so people say to me well Susan if you're teaching everybody what lying looks like can't they use that against you all right if I learn to lie if Aaron learns to lie and I'm interviewing her for a job and she's lying will I see it if she knows how to beat me the good thing is there's so many different things about lying that you can't hide them all so Aaron may be able to lie to me with a couple of sentences but sooner or later I'm gonna figure out she's lying and then I'm gonna go try to find out what the truth is okay so enough about me let's get into this the way I want to start this is I want to show you a brief video all right and I want you to tell me whether Jamie this young lady right here at the end of this video is lying to me or not all right so all and you came into the room today with some gut that tells you whether someone's being truthful or not right we all think we know what deception looks like we all think we know what truth looks like so with that gut that you guys have it tells you whether somebody's truthful or not I want you to judge Jamie we ready to go okay my first question for you TV is what involvement did you have in the companies recently just started bars run for County activities oh nine Oh  these are under direct mr. Glenn to backdate any contracts no of course not  prior to the recent audit that uncovered these accounting irregularities did you have any knowledge that mr. Glenn was back dating contracts no I mean in fact if I had knowledge about that then I would speak up and say something  is there any reason that a forensic computer review would uncover any communication with mr. Glyn regarding this matter no of course I don't have any communication with him regarding this at all  at any time the mr. Glenn ever reveal or discusses efforts to manipulate the company's accountings with you know if he had then I would have told someone fired him gotten something something would have happened if I knew anything  Jimmy why should we believe that you're not I've always had a very good reputation with the company I have no enemies in the company you know when you know i I've always done my best and I believe that I have a very good reputation with that and people trust me and I I would never do something like that especially for something that I've worked so hard at  what do you think should happen to the singing manager who directed this should learn to backdate this contract he should be fired and go to jail and there should be serious consequences  would you be willing to certify in writing that you had nothing to do with these accounting irregularities yes of course I'll sign it right now okay so this was a situation where there's an investigation going on in a company because the accountant had been cooking the books and when we went in to do the investigation we asked him why he was cooking the books they were getting ready to go into a sell the company they were looking to raise the value of the company but he said he did it specifically because he was told to we asked him who told him and he didn't want to tell us so we investigated we interviewed a whole bunch of people Jamie being one of them now I heard a couple of people say she was lying right off the top right and maybe she was and maybe she wasn't but as that interview went on were there times when you caught yourself going no I think she's being truthful and other times when used to nap that's a lie right how do we know whether she's being truthful or not what are we looking for in there let me ask you this question even if Jamie was being truthful did she have a reason to be nervous absolutely right so how do we know whether her nervousness or whether her behavior is a result of nervousness or whether it's a result of not being truthful how do we know that that's what we want to learn right if you have somebody sitting in front of you for a job interview or you're you're talking to someone in a company all your employees in a company because there's been a major theft or there's even been a little theft do those folks have a reason to be nervous absolutely they want to make sure you're getting it right they want to make sure they're coming across in the way they they should come across so how do we know the difference let's take a look at a few things there are six keys to knowing whether someone's being truthful or not or where someone's being deceptive we're gonna look at all of these individually we've got analyzed versus speculate okay what do I mean by that can I look at anybody in this room and say they're there lying to me just by looking at them just by the way they're sitting all right manage your bias every single one of us in this room has a bias we may know what that bias is but we may not know all right just happens week it comes across people recognize it but we don't see it we want to recognize evasiveness what does that look like when someone's trying to evade telling me the truth or it may telling me a deception we want to be aware of aggression aggression is one of the major keys for people being deceptive we're all gonna also gonna look at convey versus convince what do I mean by convey versus convincing and finally we're gonna look at some of those nonverbal cues any of you folks who used to watch lie to me that's what you saw with a nonverbal that's what you saw with the nonverbal so we're gonna look at some of those alright so let's get started oops what the wrong way when I talk about analyze versus analysing versus speculation what I want to look at is how a person is reacting to things okay so I need I need to find somebody who's sitting like I want them to actually you see the gentleman in the back right there who's got his arms resting okay if he were crossing his arms right here like this okay how do we view this behavior how we always been told this behavior is closed standoffish and stuff like that right and a lot of people assume that closed behavior means that they're trying to trying to manipulate me alright they're trying to come across as being truthful alright I'm just gonna hold myself right here so that nobody knows that I'm lying well you know what maybe he's standing that way because he's cold maybe he's standing that way because it's comfortable for him alright that just may be a habit form I don't want to turn around and say look close posture equals deception because if I do that I'm getting myself in trouble so a lot of us look at global behavior all right we look at weather they shift all the time we look at weather weather they you know do some of the stuff that Jamie did when she scratched her nose all those sort of things we give way too much weight to global behavior we want to do away with that that is speculation I don't want to speculate why why that gentleman in the back is sitting there with his arm across like that alright what what I want to do in other words is I want to identify that the behaviors that I see in here are a direct result of my question so if I ask Aaron Aaron did you did you take the missing merchandise alright and and and she's sitting like that that's that's bad that would if I look at that as a global evaluation that's bad I don't want to give her that alright I want it I want to see the behaviors and hear the behaviors as a result of the question I ask and it'll make sense in a minute I want to identify the stimulus the stimulus in this case whether it's an investigation whether it's a screening interview whether you're talking to someone that you want to employ in your organization the stimulus is going to be the question that I ask all right during any interview during any communication people are going to move I want that movement to come when I ask the question okay not when they're just sitting here having a conversation and never make again more sense in a minute I want to focus on the behaviors that are directly as I said we associate it with the response do you say and do something as a response of my question okay one of those deceptive behaviors and I'm going to rely on what we call timing and clusters and this is really the big deal the timing of clusters thing so for example when I ask a question I want that person to show me a deceptive behavior within the first five seconds after I ask that question if they don't show me a deceptive behavior of the list that I'm going to show you in a minute and within five seconds they're not lying to me they're not lying to me okay I need to see you're here one of those behaviors in the first five seconds if I see the first behavior in the first five seconds I don't have to see another behavior for two or three or five or ten seconds all right but I do have to see that first one in the first five seconds now not trying to be catty here but I've seen CEOs that can live for 15 minutes on one question okay there's a behavior I'm going to show you that allows you to see that how that happens but what I want to make sure is that the first be happens in the first five seconds so this is what it looks like you're all bright people you know what five seconds is okay my other my other thing I want to pay attention to are clusters and this is what makes a difference in our deceptive behaviors versus other people's deceptive categories and techniques I want to see more than one deceptive behavior within that first five-second right within that answer so I've got these which are verbals ends that are non verbals I want to see at least two or more behaviors for that to be a deceptive answer does that make sense so by c1 I might not like it I'm going to pay attention to it but I really want two or more so if I'm saying that my first behavior has to be within the first five seconds right and I need two or more deceptive indicators do I have a deceptive answer here I do right now you notice that I've got one that that happens before I actually finish the question that question stimulus I'm asking you a question and I get a nonverbal deceptive behavior I'm gonna count that even though it's not within my first five seconds why do you think up someone might give me a nonverbal or a verbal deceptive behavior before I finish the question exactly they're starting to frame their answer and guess what they think faster than I talk all right they say that the average person talks 120 to 150 words a minute the brain goes much faster than that okay some some behavior let's say it goes at least 10 times faster some be able to say you can't measure because we don't think in words we think in concepts all right so if somebody gives me a verbal response or a nonverbal response before I finished my question it's simply because their brain is going faster than my mouth is all right and then I've got that outlier there that nonverbal that lies outside of that first five seconds am I going to count that what I am right Aaron I'm gonna count why am I gonna count it exactly because I had one that happened within the first five seconds right so any behaviors that I keep singing that fall outside that first five seconds before I ask another question is gonna be part of my cluster so if I've got one I've got seven here right that tells me I've got a liar that tells me I've got a person who's not being candid and by the way we never call him a liar we just say they're not being candid okay so I'm not I've got somebody who's not being candid with me what if I had just two inside that first five seconds would that be a truthful answer would that be a deceptive answer it would be deceptive right now is that lie right there a bigger lie than the person who only shows me two deceptive behaviors we have no way of knowing right we have no way of knowing that that two deceptive behaviors could be my son telling me it isn't at homework I'm sorry that one could be my son telling me he doesn't have homework all right the person who shows me two deceptive indicators might be a really really bad person but it comes down to how much someone's buying into the lie how important is it for me to convince you I'm being truthful and at the end of the day when people are doing this kind of stuff what they're trying to do is manipulate us okay manipulate us to believe them all right manipulation is a big thing but that's what they're doing they're doing and saying things to manipulate our thoughts about them okay so timing in clusters that's our most important thing timing in clusters we want to manage your bias all right now it says up here that I want to ignore truthful behavior why do you think I want to ignore truthful behavior any thoughts  good okay right we're inherently good is everybody inherently good I mean she's right she's absolutely right you know look we were all raised to be good people well at least 90% of us in the room were raised to be good people I can't speak for everybody right but we were taught lying was wrong right and your parents tell you lying was not a good thing to do all right did your parents ever say to you look if you lie you're gonna be in twice as for trouble that you would have been if you had just told me the truth and done something wrong right so we know lying is wrong at least that's that's what we've been taught that lying is wrong deceptive people can give us truthful answers so if you ask a question of a person that they're comfortable answering they can answer that truthfully okay any discussion that you have any interview any any again anything that you're doing you're your buyer you're talking to folks and you want to get to the truth is this your lowest price and people are doing things to convince you that that's the lowest price let's start with that okay they are going to do things they're going to say things to convince you that that's the lowest price you are having a conversation with them you're trying to determine is it the lowest price what else can I get just lots of questions that you have you're taking notes you're thinking follow-up questions it is like getting a drink of water out of a firehose there's too much going on if I tell you forget about looking for truthful behavior because you will see it on some questions forget about looking at truthful behavior then that cuts your job half in half right now you're getting a drink of water out of a garden hose as opposed to out of a firehose all right it makes things a lot easier but truthful people or deceptive people who give you truthful answers make it look like they're good folks they're cooperative folks they're gonna give you everything that you need to get all right in reality what they're doing is convincing you that they're being truthful because you saw one good answer not several good answers okay for this a moment let's go back to Jamie what did Jamie do that made you think she was deceptive what'd she do somebody said somebody said she was lying right out of the box what does she do  okay she can't she touched her face her feet were tapping what else she was blinking on too quick to answer all the questions okay conversely what did she do that you liked did all of you think she was guilty good what did she do that you liked okay okay that's good and were you the one that yelled out she's lying okay no no no I knew it came from that direction but but that's good right so it was one of these Scituate of these situations where you were yes yes no yes no that is every conversation that you will have with people sounds good sounds bad sounds good sounds bad how do we split between the two did I see it hand up over there yes  yeah I didn't decorate the room I just did the interview but no you're absolutely right and that's when I talk about people manipulating our perception manipulating us to believe them that's exactly what I'm talking about because there were some questions that she answered pretty pretty nicely right there are some questions that she didn't what we what we do in a lot of situations is we ask people for example we do an investigation inside the organization you know one of our questions will be what do you do here and most of the people will just give you a job just hi a job title alright but the people that we know are already setting out to manage our perception will give us this long Job Description okay that goes way beyond what we're asking for so they gave us so much information and the purpose of that is again to convince us that they're good people well what happens when I hear if I if I'm a novice and I hear a truthful answer I start to think that's a good person it's a self-fulfilling prophecy okay I start to believe they're good I start to believe that they want to they want to cooperate and when I talk about the halo effect that's what I'm talking about so if I'm not looking for deceptive behavior and looking for truthful behavior instead I'm gonna find truthful behavior and it's gonna convince me early on that that person is good and then I'm gonna miss the bad I like the fact that you guys brought up a couple things that's gonna be here later I like the fact that you saw the feet moving I like the fact you saw the nose thing scratching your nose but which is right is she truthful or is she deceptive what makes us right alright so we're gonna talk that we're gonna get more into that alright I want to recognize evasiveness have you ever asked someone a question and they've talked for 10 minutes and then you realize they never answered the question you asked okay right I mean it it happens all the time if you ask somebody if you ask somebody is that your best price and they go through all these things tell you all these reasons why that's their best price but they haven't said no okay they've not given you the answer that you've asked for if you're if you're interviewing somebody for a job and you ask them if they've ever had problems with a with a provider or problems at a job and they give you all these great reasons for why they're a good employee but they never answer whether or not they had any problems in a job but we don't hear it because we're not thinking we're not listening for whether they answer the question or not we're just listening for whether answer so we need to make sure that they're actually giving us the information we're asking for the other thing is what we call failure to deny the most important thing to the honest person is giving you that answer denying if they didn't do something that's the most important thing the truth is their biggest ally so they're gonna want to deny something if they haven't done it okay they're gonna want to deny anything that is going to make them look better if they haven't done it so that's we need to listen for people to deny stuff then we have what we call exclusionary qualifiers now by exclusionary qualifiers I mean things like saying for the most part fundamentally not really not really exclusionary qualifiers beg for a follow up question all right absolutely beg for a follow up question now poor Aaron sat here right in front of me so I'm gonna be picking on her for the whole presentation but let's say okay I've met Aaron let's say I met Aaron last night and I really want to make a good impression with you guys so I go to Aaron this morning and I say hey Aaron look do you think what I'm wearing is okay for today now I realize I realize the conflict here because I'm sitting in front of a whole bunch of retail people okay some of you who sell clothes so I realize I'm putting myself right in the mix here but let's say the Aaron Darren do you see anything wrong with what I'm wearing and her response is not really  think about this for a moment not really okay so you know if I'm in my optimistic mood which doesn't happen very often but I'm in an optimistic mood and I hear not really I think oh I'm okay right what I'm wearing is okay but if I don't hear it from an Austin output optimistic standpoint I hear it from a negative one I go oh really so my next question to Aaron is gonna be what that's my next question to Aaron okay well Aaron if there's if there's something you had to pick that you don't like about it what would it be you don't have to answer that I just want to see if you would know but you hear what I'm saying if somebody says not really it's begging a follow-up so my fault it's got to come because if I don't ask that follow-up I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get it all right I'm not gonna hear it I'm not gonna hear what the real answer is so if somebody says to you well fundamentally this is the way we do things or for the most part this is the things that we that this is the way we do things they're cutting something out we want to know what it is that they're cutting out so you have to ask that follow-up question well okay that's what you do basically but what did you do in this situation okay so that's exclusionary qualifiers I have used one of these before all right aggression attacking the questioner let's say you've had a theft and you're interviewing all of your employees all right and and you ask them did you did you have anything to do with this did you remove any of this information right and make just come back at you and say you guys always think it's me you know it's just because the way I was born or how I dressed or whatever if you always think it's me and they question they attack you you know how and you don't even in this store you don't even know what goes on people walk in and out all the time that's big all right when I talk about different behaviors there's some behaviors that way more than others aggression is one of those okay if you have somebody who jumps down your throat because you ask them a question I don't even care if it's your kid you know yet you say to your kid what did you do last night and they're like why are you always asking me this you don't trust me why don't you trust me okay what ever ever done all right you got a problem you got a problem all right attacking a third party all right it's the same sort of thing you know it locates the stores fog the store doesn't have very good security all right it's it's it's you know we have we don't have what we need in here you know you guys never bring the right stuff in of course that's gonna disappear because we can't sell it all right they're attacking the third party right again it's a big deal any time you're talking about aggression any sort of attack it's big demonstrating an inappropriate level of concern opposite ends of the spectrum you ask them a question you ask him like an important question and they're like oh please you know oh here we go again those sort of things or they just get angry they go from 0 to 124 for really no reason you just ask a question that's it let me give you a small example of that and you know in aggression can be words I mean concern can be words or it can be it can be what they do on their face any of you guys in here remember Scott Peterson great that killed us was convicted of killing his wife and unborn child Laci okay eventually he was convicted but before when he was sitting in jail there was an interview that they had with Diane Sawyer and leading up to it and Diane said but Scott here's the question everybody in America wants to know did you kill your wife now probably most of us would sit there and if we hadn't killed our spouses would try to figure out the right or would know the right things to say what Scott Peterson did and said was he smiled first thing he did was he smiled he goes I love my wife no no I wouldn't I wouldn't have kept I wouldn't kill lazy but he smiled how weird is that you made the hair on the back of my neck stand up somebody's just asked you if you killed your wife and unborn child and you're smiling okay so anyway in an appropriate level of concern now here's where I want to get into what you guys are talking about a minute ago this can this could convince versus convey if I ask what's your name Tiffany because I'm really tired of picking on poor Aaron even if I ask Tiffany Tiffany did you take the merchandise okay what are the two answers that Tiffany can give me that would let me know whether or not she took the merchandise what are the two appropriate answers that would convey information yes or no yes or no but what if I say Tiffany did you take the missing merchandise and she runs into this hole look I'm a good employee I've been loyal to this company for so long I've never done anything that would give you any reason to think I'm less than than a stellar employee what is she doing here is she conveying information is she trying to convince me of something she's trying to convince me of something right she's trying to convince me she's a good employee that nobody should ever have any question about okay that is what you're going to hear most of the time a convincing statement is the the strongest arrow that any person's going to have in their quiver okay saying I'm a good person I'm a good worker all of those sort of things when you talk about trying to try to manage someone's perception let me think about it think about it for just a moment because maybe Tiffany is a good person maybe Tiffany is a stellar employee maybe she had a bad day she took something and now she doesn't know what to do so when somebody's trying to convince me of something going back to minute ago when I said people can talk they can they can answer a question for ten minutes but never answer the question I asked they can talk all day when I said I've seen CEOs alive for twenty five minutes on a single question that's what I'm talking about they'll start talking about how healthy their company is how great their sales are how wonderful their employee and their management team are what they're doing is trying to convince me not convey information to me okay convincing statements are so strong let me give you another example from history you guys all remember our last name Susan the woman who put her children in the back of the car or in the car and their car seats and Susan Smith thank you how can you forget Smith okay Susan Smith she put her kids in the car seat you know push the car into the like way into the cops and said that somebody had carjacked her car right we were doing a training session for some for some law enforcement in Indiana and these gentlemen happened to be in the class they're from Union South Carolina they happen to be in the class and they came up and they said Hayden we now know how students Smith initially beat us when she came into the police station she ran into the station she's crying she's hysterical somehow I got to hijack my car my kids are in the car citizen did you have anything to do with it Susan Smith's answer was I love my children I would never harm my children why would I hurt my children what did you not hear you didn't hear a denial right you didn't hear her say no I didn't what you did hear her say was I wouldn't hurt my children guess what wouldn't and didn't aren't the same thing somebody says I wouldn't do something it's not the same thing as saying I didn't do something we have to listen for didn't okay we have to listen for the words what people are saying not what we think they say because when our thought doesn't make sense for someone to kill their kids right in fact in fact we said to them we said well what did you say to her and why did she beat you and they said because what she said made sense now for just a moment they hadn't done an investigation yet right she just came in she's crying she's hysterical she's got all this stuff going on they have no proof of anything other than the fact of what she's standing there telling them and so they say you know we said it what did you say what did you say we said what we asked her why she would say that and you know we got this behavior we didn't like this behaviors we finally said to her we said Susan look sometimes things happen and you know your parents your parents get out of control and for just a moment you know just a moment maybe something happened and she just continuing with no I love my children I would never hurt my children blah-blah-blah-blah-blah okay so what we say is when you hear convincing statements and you're you have no investigation in Susan Smith's case what you have to do is go hmm I just heard three protest statements or convincing statements I love my children I would never harm my children I do nothing my children I don't hear a denial if we talk about clusters being two or more do I have a lie absolutely right I've got the I've got the not I'm not answering or not giving me a denial and I've got three what we call convincing statements okay now convincing statements sounds so true or in this particular case eerie beautiful irrefutable let's say this the officers say to Susan so Susan look you say you didn't kill your wife I'll kill your kids prove it prove it and she goes I love my kids I take care of my kids I take him to church they're happy they're well fed they're well clothed all this sort of stuff now mr. police officer what do you have at this point they got nothing so convincing statements sound really true again Tiffany may be a good person but that didn't answer my question okay so guess who I'm gonna be looking at I'm gonna be looking at Tiffany okay referral statements referral statements are statements that people make over and over again to try to convince you didn't do anything wrong all right so let's say let's say this young lady standing up back right here let's say she went outside to go to the bathroom while I'm standing here talking she comes back in and she was hey Susan let me interrupt for just a sec I need you guys to know that there are sort of little green men running around the hallway and what's our first impression of this young lady who just walked in right okay but let's say she does know I know I know it's hard to believe but I'm telling you some little green men running around out there now what are we inclined to do go look right so she's now starting to bring us in we're starting to believe a little bit about what she says that again is perception manipulation all right invoking religion people will talk about you know swear on stack of Bibles I swear to God and the counting world I swear on GAAP you know all these sort of things that that people all these sort of things that people will tell us because let's face it and this more specially in this world of political you know rightness and everybody wanting to be good and not step on anybody's toes somebody throws out religion what are you having your backpack your purse your desk drawer that beats religion okay that's a dangerous dangerous one perception qualifiers are a little different than exclusionary qualifiers perception qualifiers are that that people say and do to dress up their lie to verbally dress up their life things like well to tell you the truth honestly frankly as some of you are maybe sitting in this room and saying Oh crepe these are that's the common phrase for me I'll say that stuff all the time right it's a habit okay you're lucky because we're looking at clusters okay so you get your frankly you get your honestly it's when you start having start having more and more because deception and your answer that we're gonna pay attention okay nonverbals now a lot of times people will say to me well Susan if you say that the behaviors start within the first five seconds I'll beat you and just not do or say anything for five seconds well unfortunately for you a behavioral pause is a deceptive indicator okay now for just a moment you have to think about this because you have to ask yourself if you get a pause so the question makes sense for a pause so if I say the Aaron for example Aaron let's see January 26th ten years ago what were you doing does that allow a pause right okay so it's only fair that she gets a pause there but what if I say so Aaron January 26 ten years ago did you rob the bank of America yet see she answered that pretty quickly right if they had taken her time to think about that answer you guys got to look at your hiring policies okay because that would have been a problem all right verbal nonverbal disconnect what I want you to do it once you do a little trip for me for another little game for me for a moment I want you to look at the person sitting next to you before you do it though look at me I want you to look at the person sitting next to you and I want you to say do you like me okay and I want that person to go yes I like you very much okay and then I want you to switch so do it real quick because we're how much time  okay okay all right okay all right I don't have a lot of time okay did that feel weird did that feel weird all right and that's telling you to do that okay that's telling you to do that and you find it hard to do you're deliberately doing it if you see someone do that it's huge it means their brain is so fried that they're not doing what their body is made to do okay now everything that I'm talking about with example with exceptions to that one verbal nonverbal disconnect is cross-cultural cross-gender you can use it anywhere in the world this one is one of those you cannot all right you can't because they're India for example they that's how they answer all right but every place else you can use the verbal nonverbal disconnect you just have to know your audience a little bit anchor point movements anchor point movements are the things that anchor you to the ground to the world to the earth for example my feet right now would be anchor points if my arms are like this they would be anchor points if you asked me a question and in response to that question I move my arms or my legs that's an anchor point movement all right you mentioned the feet if I'm sitting in a chair my bottom is my anchor point my back is my anchor point my feet are my anchor point feet are always anchor points all right we all women especially ABBA tend to sit with their legs crossed and we have that foot that's dangling we call a hanging anchor point watch it because that's where it's gonna go that person is trying to maintain control of themselves it's going to go to that floating anchor point grooming gestures things that people do to again dress up the lie they might fix their tie they might fix their hair they might look at their watch anything like that that would be dressing up the life physically and then finally hands to the face okay if some if someone is in a flight-or-fight syndrome or flyer fight phase which means that they rather than tell you the truth they're gonna try to keep it in they're gonna do stuff the the blood vessels at the ends of the fingers and the ends start to shrink and itches so they will start playing with their their nose or their ear or scratch their hands or like that so hands to the face are huge okay any questions you want to know the shot at her oh yes sir  there seem to be an art or science around the pauses that you had after every question can you talk a little bit about yes I can it means I'm cutting my can you ask me in the answer question session I do what I'm supposed to do okay all right let's but but you're absolutely right let's look at her real quick think about things that we talked about think about what you guys mentioned earlier about you would like the fact that she was answering his questions more but that's not good okay and she didn't really answer the question so the more people talk the worse it is okay so let's go my first question for you Jimmy is what involvement to do have in the companies recently discovered far as we went accounting activities oh nine  appropriate level of concern feet move did you make you write to mr. Gulen to backdate any contracts no of course not feet move an appropriate level of  prior to the recent audit that uncovered these accounting irregularities did you have any knowledge that mr. Glenn was back dating contracts no I mean in fact if I had knowledge about that then I would speak up and say something  convincing statement I would spoke up move  is there any reason that forensic computer with you would uncover any communication with mr. Glenn regarding this matter no of course I don't have any communication with them regarding this at all I'm okay with that one except for the feet move but that's the only one behavior at anytime mr.

cards we've taken the Joker's out now I don't know if you have a preferred way of shuffling the cards but I'd like to give you about half the cards like you mix those up as much as you like maybe you can help me do this can you wash them here on the table like this yeah now the hardest part of course is collecting all those cards so we're gonna square all these cards up and now you feel those are pretty well shuffled for yourself as well thank you tower I'm gonna spread these face up and then I'm gonna do a kind of a crazy shuffle okay I'm gonna turn these face down and I'm gonna shuffle them together but before I push them in I want you to see the state that the ring all right very well mixed up and then tell if you would take your hand and place it like this for me if you wouldn't yeah and then can you place your hand place it above and press the cards together that way you don't only see them and all the way down the line you actually feel them being shuffled it all the way all the way working so effortlessly as you do together  would you agree those are really well-mixed yeah I would know now I'll say this there is only one other shuffle that mixes the cards in a more thorough way and this is a shuffle that is preferred by children and drunks okay it doesn't matter the cars are completely mixed up in fact why don't you guys get in there feel like a kid again I want you to go ahead turn them over mix up face up face down do whatever you like give them a nice little mix you feel pretty good about that actually starting to make me feel worse and worse I'm gonna gather up the cards together and gentlemen this is my favorite part even though I'm going to find your two cards which is really impressive because you haven't even picked them yet okay so let's do this yeah I'll go through here face up or face down here's where like you do reach in there and grab one on face up or face down is your choice it's absolutely you should face up thank you so much I really appreciate that I got it it doesn't matter what the card is if I know it it's okay what matters is which way you take it out so would you please reach in there take another one for me she would and you got another one card face up then three plugs I love it so now gentlemen you can put the card back in you remember that you showed it to the camera you can put it back in any way you like face up or face down it's completely up to you yeah slide it in there absolutely so you see it going in and which way do you want to put it back in face up or face down great slide right in there for me if you even leave it sticking out so you see it there up until the very last moment now look at this point some cards are face up some cards are face  there and if I little sit there they start to move all on their own they start to turn over so now every card is facing the right way every card is now face-up except for one  this might be heading but come and join me around the funny thank you let

(Laughter) Also, he is a liar on your left. Even the one sitting in your chair has such an epithet. We are all liars. What I'm going to do today is to tell you why recent studies make us all liars how to become a liar and why you might want to seek the truth even more passing from a liar's catch to a single seeker of truth and finally create what is called faith. And to talk about faith, since I wrote the book \"Liespotting,\" no one wants to meet me in person, no no no no no no. They say \"No problem, send it by email.\" (Laughter) I can't even drink a cup of coffee at Starbuck. My husband says \"Hey honey, any trick? Perhaps it would have been better to focus on cooking. How do you think about cooking French food? \" So before I get started, what will I do is that I will make my intent clear that is not about learning any game. Cheaters are not just spoiled kids, that at the bottom of the room shout \"Gotcha, Gotcha\" Your eyebrow rises immediately. You're touched where you shouldn't. I watch that TV show \"Lie to me\" or \"I know you\\'re lying\". No, the rogues are armed with a great scientific knowledge on how to best deceive They use deception to quickly get to the truth and do exactly what the world leaders do every day; they have difficult conversations with difficult people often even in difficult times. And so they embark on this journey accepting an important proposal which is: Lie is an act of cooperation. Think little, no lies at all, whatever the way of speech and speech. Her \"power\" landed only when someone else agrees to believe the lie. I know I can sound like a tough love, but, if ever you were the lying side happened because you agreed to be like that. The first rule about lying: Lie is a cooperative act. Now, not all lies are harmful. Sometimes, unconsciously, we are ready to partake in deception for the interest of social dignity, just for the reason of keeping it a secret. We say, \"Good song.\" \"Heart, you don\\'t look healthy under it, no\" Or say, this is my favorite, \"You know what, I just deleted that email from the spam folder. I\\'m sorry.\" But there are also times when we want to be part of the trick. And that can cost us drastically. Last year, $ 991 billion in damages were recorded only from corporate fraud in America. That's only a small fraction under a trillion dollars. That makes up about seven percent of total revenue. This is an example of where fraud can cost billions. Consider the case of Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like the cases of Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, when the lie can even betray our state can compromise security and undermine the development of democracy, they can cause the death of those who protect us Cheating is really a serious topic This jerk, Henry Oberlander, was an effective diploma rogue. British authorities say he could be the man who has damaged the entire Western banking system. And you can't find this person on Google, you can't find it anywhere. He had once interviewed her, and said: \"Look, I\\'ve got a rule.\" And that was Henry's rule, he said, \"Look, everyone is ready to give you something. They are ready to give you something for whatever you are eager to have. \" And this is the essence. If you don't want to be fooled, you should know what are you eager for? This is the fact that we are inclined to admit it. We would like to be better husbands, better wives, smarter, with more power, longer, richer and the list goes on indefinitely. The lie is an attempt to fill this void a way to connect our desires and fantasies about what we would like to be, and how we would like to be, with who we really are. And it is absurd if we want to fill these gaps with lies and lies These days, some studies have concluded that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times. You know, most of these are white lies. But in another study, aliens are said to lie more than three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. (Laughter) And when we first hear this data, we are drawn to it. We can't believe how much lies prevail everywhere. In essence we are all against it. But if you look a little deeper the plot just thickens. We lie to strangers more than our peers. Living people lie more than those who are less socialized. Men lie eight times more about themselves than for others. As women lie more to protect others. If you're a middle-aged married couple, you will find the partner in one of 10 different cases. Now you may think this is wrong. And while you are unmarried, the number goes to three. The lie is complex. It is fabricated in the factory of our daily, private and personal lives. We are deeply frustrated by this reality. We have even introduced the lie as a necessary daily basis, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes only because we do not understand the spaces of our lives. This is the second bitter truth about the lie. We are against lying, but we are secretly in favor of it in the ways that our society has condemned for centuries and for centuries and centuries. The lie is as old as the breathing of mankind. It's part of our culture, of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare, Bible, World News. (Laughter) Lie has a lot of value for us as human beings. Searchers have great knowledge the more intelligent the species, the more brains they have, the more apt they are to cheat and lie. Now you can remember Kokon. Is there anyone who remembers Coconut, Coco, gorillas being taught sign language? Koko was trained to communicate with sign language. Here is Koko with her kitten. It's her charming kitty, full of fur. Koko once blamed her kitten for problems with the gloss of the sink by its wall. (Laughter) We are well-trained to be the leaders of a package. And it starts very early in time How long? Babies will pretend to cry, will pause, to see who is appearing and then they will come back and cry again. One year olds learn these puzzling secrets. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. The five-year-olds lie like this, completely straightforward. They manipulate through jokes. Nine-year-olds are experts at hiding the consequences of actions. By the time you enter high school you will find under one of the nine possible cases. And the moment we step into the job of being a family keeper we enter different distributed worlds with fake digital friends, media of party bias, clever identity thieves, bank failures like that Ponzi Schemers, an epidemic trick - in short, as one author calls it a post-reality society. It has been very confusing for a long time. What are you doing? Well, there are some measures we can take to brighten our way. Liquid detectives are trained and come to the truth in 90 percent of cases. The rest of us are ourselves 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars, and bad liars. But there are no original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques. So what will I do is that I'm going to show you two patterns of cheating. And then we'll look at and analyze them, and find the features for ourselves. Let's start with the speech. (Video) Bill Clinton: I want you all to hear me. And I'll say it again I haven't had sex with that wife, Mrs. Lewinsky. Never like I told someone to lie, never single, never. And these accusations are all false I need to get back to work for the American people Thank you. Pamela Meyer: OK, what were the talkative signs? Well first we heard what it means non-protocol denial. Studies show that people are very predictive of their denials will use the official language rather than the informal one. We also heard a little about the distant phrase \"that woman.\" We know that liars irresponsibly distance themselves by their subject using language as a powerful weapon. Now, if Bill Clinton had said \"Well, I\\'m right ...\" or the famous Richard Nixon, \"With All Sincerity ....\" he would be a dead bypass for every liar I know that qualified language, as it is called, if it so qualifies further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated the question completely, or if he had filled his account with a small detail - and we're all glad he didn't - he would have hidden himself further. Freud had his rights. Freud said, look, there is more than one speech here: \"No mortal man can keep a secret. If the lips don\\'t speak, he speaks with his fingers. \" And we all do it, no matter the power. We all deal with fingerprints I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss Kahn with Obama which are being agreed upon by fingerprints. (Laughter) Now this brings us to another model, which is body language. With body language, that's what we should do. You just have to throw your assumptions out the door. Let science have a little patience with your knowledge. Because we think liars play all the time. Well listen to this, they are known to freeze their upper bodies when they are lying. We think liars don't look us in the eye. Well listen to this, they look you in the eye more sec just to make up for that myth. We always think of the warmth and the smile sow sincerity and loyalty But a trained lie detector it can detect a mile-long smile. Can you all identify the pretentious smile? You can consciously control them muscles on your cheek. But the real smile is in the eyes, it stays in the eyes. They cannot be controlled consciously, especially if you overuse Botox. Don't overuse Botox, no one will think you're honest. Now we will look at some spots. Can you tell what is going on in the conversation? Can you start seeing the lies discrepancies between people's actions and words? Now I know it's really noticeable but when you are having a conversation to someone you suspect is cheating on you, Behavior, to date, is the greatest indicator of truth. An honest person will be a collaborator. They will tell you they are on your side. They will be enthusiastic. They will express readiness and help to get to the truth. They will be ready for ideas, suspicious names, and provide details. They\\'ll say, \"Hey, maybe it was those payroll guys who forgot to mention. \" They will get angry if they feel they are being unfairly accused throughout the interview, not just in separate sheets; they will be frustrated throughout the interview. If you ask honestly what should we do with those check guys, an honest person has a lot of opportunities recommend a strict sentence rather than a mild one Let's say you have the same conversation with a rogue. This person can withdraw, look down, lower your voice to rest, to behave like a herky-jerky. Ask a rogue to tell their story, they will fill it with full details in some unnecessary places. And then they will re-tell the story in chronological order. And what a trained investigator does is that they get into some sketches and subtle ways for a few hours, and will ask that person to tell the story once again and they will look at the jolts, the stuttering, and will ask him some questions that conclude this is a hoax. Why do they do this? Well we all do the same thing. We practice our words, but rarely do we exercise gestures. We say \"Yes\", we shake hands, \"No\" We tell very compelling stories, and we move our arms. We plead guilty to serious crimes, and we smiled as we walked away from them. And that smile is called \"beast fun\". And we'll see that in some video sequences, but we'll start - for those of you who don't know it, this is the candidate for president, John Edwards who shocked America when she accepted a child out of wedlock. We will see him talking about the paternity test. Watch it now if you can see it he says \"Yes\" while shaking his head for \"No\" shaking a little even the arms. (Video) John Edwards: I would be happy to participate. I know it's impossible for this kid to be mine because of the timing of the events that happened So, I know it's impossible. I'm happy to do the paternity test, and see it happening. Interviewer: Will you do it soon? And it's someone - JE: Well, I'm the only person, the only person who is part of this test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: All right, these head movements are easier to catch if you look at them only once. There will be some when someone makes an expression hiding the other flowing fast like a flash Killers are known to cause distress. Your new partner may shake your hand to celebrate, to go to lunch with you and then display a sense of anger. None of us will become an overnight face recognition expert but I can teach you something that is really dangerous, and easy to learn and that is the expression of contempt. In anger, you got two people in the same field. Still this is a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to despair, you are overbearing. It is related to moral superiority. And for that reason, healing is very, very difficult. Here's how it looks. It is marked by a corner drawn in and out. It is the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt, even if the fraud goes down - and it doesn't happen often - look the other way, go the other direction reconsider the agreement, say \"No thanks. I will not come for just a little weave. Thank you\" Science has revealed many, many indicators. We know, for example that liars often change the norm of ignorance and the legs lead them to the exit. They will receive obstructive objects inserting them between yourself and the person they are interviewing They will change their tone too often reducing the volume. This is the agreement. These behaviors are only behaviors. They are not evidence of fraud. They are just red flags. We are human beings We often make deceptive gestures in many places all day. And these gestures do not have much significance. But when you see them being grouped, then that is the sign. See, hear, investigate, ask some difficult questions, get out of that comfortable position of acquaintance, but go down that path of curiosity, still ask questions, be more dignified, and treat the person you are talking to with a report. Don\\'t try to be like them in \"Law & Rule\" or like in other programs punching their subjective thoughts. Don't be too aggressive because it doesn't work. And we talked a little how to communicate makes us lie and how to discover a liar. And as I promised, we will now see what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers - one is lying, one is telling the truth. And both have surfaced by studio David Matsumoto from California. And I think they are a brilliant example how the truth is revealed in reality. This article, Diane Downs shot her children from close dissonance, sent them to the hospital while they were bleeding all the way, saying that a stranger had done this to her children. And you will see it in the video too that she can't even pretend to be a doting mother. What do you want to see here is an incredible mismatch amidst the horrific events she describes and her very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see a double pleasure in this video (Video) Diane Downs: At night when I closed my eyes, I saw Christ extending his hand while I was giving the car, and blood was starting to flow from his mouth. And that - it will probably disappear with time - but I don't believe it. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'll show you a video of a currently worried mother, Erin Runnion, facing her daughter's killers in court. Here you will not see pretentious emotions, but only a normal expression of a mother in agony. (Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement in the third anniversary of the night you took my baby, and you hurt him, you broke it, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she has fought, I know she has fought against you. But I know she's watching you with her gorgeous brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill him. And I don't understand and I want to never understand. PM: OK, there is no point in doubting the truth of these emotions. Now technology is about the truth of what it looks like is advancing, as is science. We know, for example that we also have specialized eye detectors or infrared scanners, MRIs that can decode the signals our body outputs when we want to cheat. And these technologies will serve each of us as a solution to fraud, and one day they will come up with very interesting results. But also at the same time you have to ask yourself: You will want your side during the meeting someone who has been trained to find the truth or any person who will draw a 400-pound electroencephalogram along the door? The lie detectors rely on human tools. They know, as someone said, \"The character that you are in the dark.\" And what's very interesting is that nowadays we have very little darkness. Our world is illuminated 24 hours a day. It's transparent with blogs and social networks transmitting the movements of the new generation of people who have made the choice to live their lives in public. It's a noisy world. And, a challenge we have is to remember distribution, which is not honesty. Our craze for twittering or writing can blind us to the fact that the details of human behavior, integrity and character they are very important, and that is what will always matter. So in such a noisy world, surely it will make sense to us to be a little more clear about our moral code. When you combine the science of detecting fraud with the art of seeing, listening, you distance yourself from cooperating with a liar. You start this path being a little clearer, because it annoys all the people around you, and say, \"Hey, my world, our world, it has to be honest. My world will be one where it will have a lot of power where the lie is recognized and marginalized. \" And when you do that, the terrain around you will shift slightly. And that's the truth.

boys kill Americans but what drove them to commit their horrific crimes the victims had been cut open and their organs had been removed was it nature her father was reportedly a sex offender he's the most deranged fellow I ever met or nurture  [Applause]  John Wayne Gacy a sadistic serial killer that fooled even his closest friends and neighbors this is a hard driving very hard-working individual I was astounded a pillar of society with a shocking secret we took a screwdriver into a little crack in the floor and when we did the whole floor lifted up he would become one of the most prolific serial killers in American history they asked him well why why did you do this stuff I was afraid they would exposed me he said they were all just human trash anyway but was John Wayne Gacy a product of his upbringing or was he born to kill [Music]  John Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago in 1942 the only son of Marian and john gacy senior John Casey was a son of a blue-collar worker a mother who was a pharmacist his biological father drank alcohol but continued to work he was considered a functioning alcoholic from what I understand he was physically abused by his father and his father was often not available or was intoxicated his father was also known for abusing Casey's mother in fact engaging in physical fights with her that Casey must have witnessed now clearly those sorts of things have an impact on a person's development and the way they look at the world the young John was close to his mother but to his father the overweight an athletic boy was a disappointment one that he made little effort to hide his father would come home he would go down into the basement into his workshop not interact with anyone in the family but had this special thing about his son whom he felt should be better more like the father become a business person become someone who was admired in the community cases father regularly called him stupid a mama's boy and a sissy his father frequently told him he was a failure he wouldn't amount to anything so again you you think of how someone growing up with that kind of verbal abuse and emotional abuse would develop as an adult john entered his teenage years and began to complain of body problems headaches and faintness dizziness which the father must have seen as a weakening that this was not a strong person this was not a person who could stand up and be tall and be successful  at school the young Gacy continued to disappoint he entered serially high schools and to great disappointment to his father he tended to fail and there were reasons for failure perhaps put forward I mean he he was ADHD he had real problems concentrating  despite his failures john gacy jr. was getting a reputation as a braggart he told fanciful stories and could confidently talk himself out of trouble at 11 years old Gacy was struck on the head by a swing resulting in a series of blackouts his father accused him of faking at age 16 he began taking medication for a heart ailment Gacey was seen as weaker than other teenagers these conspired but overriding most of these excuses for his failure was the basic fact that John Wayne Gacy was very good at producing justifications and excuses for why he failed age 20 and without qualifications Gacy left Chicago and struck out on his own [Music] he traveled to Las Vegas where he found a job cleaning up in a mortuary he entered the world will one to one basis he no longer as it were were living living in the shadow his family and particularly his father he kind of fell a bit of a release working in there and sweeping up was probably not the kind of high status job but it was a job he attained on his own and it was a job that he managed to hold down the work was low paid and menial Gacy often worked alone with only dead bodies for company a number of serial killers will go through a variety of experiences which will mean that they come into close proximity with dead bodies in Casey's case we know that he acted as a janitor in a mortuary we have a kind of familiarization with dead bodies a familiarization that would take away the taboo of being around a dead body  John Wayne Gacy 'he's new life in las vegas didn't last long after only three months he used what little money he'd saved to return to Chicago there he enrolled in a business college and for the first time Gacy began to flourish he'd always had the gift of the gab but he soon discovered a flair for salesmanship [Music] Gacy suddenly realized that there was something that gave him a steal is something that made him stand up in the world where he could as it were stand shoulder to shoulder and even beyond that with those individuals around him  by the age of just 21 cases business talents had won him the position of manager at a shoe store he realized that his abilities his acting abilities his charm and disarm abilities that most kind of inherent Psychopaths seem to have this cold indifference actually works for you in interactions he then found this success and he found his career success could even match the expectations of his father in September 1964 Gacy met and married his co-worker Marlon Myers Marlins father saw promise in his ambitious new son-in-law and appointed him the manager of his three fast food franchises in Iowa joel and marvin began a new life in Waterloo together they had two children Gacy was now a family man a rising star in the local business world and a popular member of the community on the surface it was a storybook existence Gacy was a role model he was the role model of what a businessman should be he should be involved in all these political organizations all of these business organizations he should be the upstanding citizen in his small town but it really had no meaning for him otherwise if it had he wouldn't have needed to go into the remainder of what he did for the rest of his life what John Wayne Gacy would become would shock his suburban neighbors to their core  after a childhood plagued by illness and failure John Wayne Gacy now had a wife two children and was the successful manager of a chain of fast-food outlets [Music] the gazes appeared the perfect nuclear family  but behind the respectable facade John Wayne Gacy had begun to inhabit a world at odds with the straight-laced image of Midwestern suburbia he got started abusing teenage boys sexually and there are a few chilling incidents where he actually threatened some of these young men that we didn't injure or kill anyone as far as we know  in 1967 Gacy lured 16 year-old John Tully to his home they watched pornographic movies drank and played pool then without warning Gacy forced toddler E onto a bed at knifepoint handcuffed him and started to choke him Gacy was arrested the 26 year old family man and bright light of the community was charged with sodomy and sentenced to 10 years in Anamosa  it's a high-walled institution there are armed guards on the towers and very restricted movement inside the compound to the prison fellow inmate ray Cornell became KC's close friend this rigorous s prison I think should be it was dangerous there were numerous murder attempts while I was serving the two years that I was there and at least one occasion I witnessed a person stabbed to death was not a very nice place to be a convicted homosexual sex offender Gacy should have been high on the prison hit list John told everyone that he was serving time for showing pornographic movies to teenage boys John was very careful never to reveal in the fact that he in fact was in there for molesting or attempting to molest teenage boys with the truth behind his crimes successfully hidden Gacy showed the same ambitious streak as he had as a free man only this time he was striving to be a pillar of a very different community [Music] Richard Snavely was a prison counselor at the time he came into contact with inmate Gacy he had a small little sign that he wore that was very much like the nametags that the employees wore which said john gacy first cook and you're a man of some authority here what do what is your title well I first cook in the kitchen and I run the morning meal in the afternoon meal in the kitchen John how long you've been here I've been here now a year in about two weeks he kind of got himself ingratiated into the system he was very responsible very adult in his style he was older than the average inmate he was able to try to develop a position and he was pretty successful and in doing that  but his friend ray Cornell witnessed another side to John Wayne Gacy during an encounter with an openly gay convict known as mr. connect  mr. connected some of his friends were in the lorry yard of the prison playing basketball and the ball got loose and went rolling past John and John got the ball and threw it as hard as he could and connect not showing a lot of good judgment then said missed me missed me now you gotta kiss me and John went after it just for a second I think I saw just a glimpse of what his victims saw at the end of their lives because he had every intention of going after Gary connect and hurting him badly or killing I think I saw the monster  at Christmas 1969 JC received news that would affect him profoundly we were sitting in the lower yard did the card-playing area when a guard came down and got jaunt and took him up to the security office Casey's father had died from cirrhosis and the authorities were not to permit him to attend the funeral but when I saw him again the following morning in the chow hall he was a wreck he requested permission to visit his father and I suppose make amends with him my suspicion is that when his father died that was difficult because what it means is that you can never repair this relationship  people always want the approval of their parents no matter how old they are he talked about his father over the next several days and he also talked about how deeply hurt he was at the fact that he would not be going over to Chicago to see his father buried but in 1970 less than two years after his conviction Casey's model behavior paid off why am I asking how long do you plan to take up residence here well I hope to be getting out sometime and may what's interesting about Casey's prison experiences as a result of the sodomy charges is firstly he's released very quickly his sentence was 10 years he was out after 18 months he was able to convince people that his behavior wouldn't be repeated but within that 18 months he rises to the top of the prison hierarchy despite the fact as a sex offender one would have expected him to be at the bottom of the prison hierarchy so what we're seeing here is the skills that actually underlie cases behavior over a long period of time skills that allow other people to gain confidence in him to see him as responsible to see him as trustworthy of course ultimately he would abuse that responsibility he'd abused that trust  in 1970 Gacy now divorced returned to his home city of Chicago eventually settling into the quiet suburban neighborhood of Norwood leaving his past in Iowa Gacy continued his ambitions to be seen as an important valued pillar of the local community he married divorcee Carol Hoff and she and her two children moved into his home there was an indomitable spirit in Gacy he really did think he was beginning to become invulnerable that he could rise again and simply getting married was just another strategic plan as far as Gacy was concerned there was no real sexual intent in this marriage it was convenience as in Iowa cases images the perfect suburban neighbor was a mere facade  in 1971 he was charged by Chicago police with disorderly conduct after a teenage boy complained that Gacy had picked him up at a bus station and forced him to commit a sexual act the case was dropped when the boy failed to appear in court in 1972 Gacy was charged with battery the case never went to trial  Timothy Jack McCoy was just 15 years old when he was picked up by Gacy at a Chicago bus station in 1972 after spending the night together Gacy stabbed him to death Gacy would later claim the killing was accidental and in self-defense many murderers commit a murder because of the force of particular circumstances at a particular point in their life but crucially the vast majority of murderers are overwhelmed psychologically by the fact they've taken another person's life and they never want to repeat that experience because they understand how difficult that has been not just for the victim for the victim's family but also for themselves sadly a small number of murderers want to continue to behave like that because they found that experience visceral vital exciting sexy Gacy had his first taste of murder it would be far from his last  in 1970 after serving time in prison for molesting teenage boys John Wayne Gacy remarried and began building a new life in Chicago but his image as a loving family man and generous neighbor was a sham in 1972 he'd picked up 15 year-old Timothy McCoy for sex and killed him  gacy would not be arrested for the murder of the teenager as far as the rest of the world was concerned the fifteen-year-old had simply disappeared and to the local community John Wayne Gacy seemed evermore the perfect suburban neighbor the neighbors on the black liked him he was a he was a very friendly man he would give these tremendous outside parties for 100 to 200 people Gacy regularly entertained his neighbors by dressing up as a clown and performing magic tricks Gacy was the kind of person that not knowing how evil he was you would like to have him in your community he was active in the Jaycees which is the Junior Chamber of Commerce and he was volunteer for the political party of his choice and he was very well thought of in a very small world of his community  [Music] in 1974 Gacy established his own painting decorating and construction business hiring a string of young men to carry out the work his charisma and bravado ensured there was no shortage of potential employees the boys knew John Wayne Gacy he was a big name in town and when he walked in he was John he had the big car outside he had the money everybody knew he was wealthy he had a big business and when he approached boys that were 14 15 16 years old making minimum wage and he was promising them almost double salary just to work in a construction site and help him build these boys jumped jumped at the chance gazes up standing image as generous neighbor successful businessman and do-gooder in the community meant his motives for employing many of the young men went undiscovered I find it very interesting that people have a Hollywood image of the serial killer as being this rather scary man that's going to pop up from behind a bush and attack and kill was in fact serial killers by and large are very well socialized into their community often holding down very responsible jobs within the community often seen as being pillars of the community and indeed Gacy is almost living out a fantasy that he must have had about being a pillar of the community by the mid seventies behind closed doors gazes wife began complaining of his violent mood swings she divorced him and  gacy began actively cruising chicago's city streets looking to pick up young men from gay districts known pickup spots and areas where Waifs and strays would congregate  Gacy was able to actually use one of his roles that of a pseudo police officer he had the wherewithal in terms of you know the radio and he would often hide behind a badge and have you know bits of what looked like police paraphernalia he would pick them up here cruising the streets in a car that had a very large light on it as the police often did and he would be able to stop people using that as if he were a police officer picking up strays taking them home torturing them in 1975 boys began disappearing some had been selling sex on the streets some were young runaways some were connected with his construction business Casey's technique of charming and disarming his victims was pretty much similar to the way that he actually engaged people in a legitimate business way he would keep them entertained with his verb overall and be able to actually charm them quickly and rapidly into situations that they could not escape from and once he had got them into a position where he felt that he was totally in power he would change he would change very quickly in the twinkling of an eye you would become the commanding frightening torturous monster he always picked the kind of attractive guy that he could never be himself but these individuals became less individualistic as far as he's concerned they became more and more objects I mean the more they became simply objects for him to do with as he wish the more horrific and torturous their experience was within his company [Music] Kaycee seems to me to fall into the criteria of the hedonistic serial killer in other words the person who kills simply for the sexual thrill of killing rumors circulated amongst the gay community about the dangers of a large man with a liking for violent sadistic sex but despite an ever-increasing number of disappearing young men they were simply assumed to have left town or run away with no bodies discovered they were chalked up as just another of the thousands of missing persons reported in the city each year the police tend to call young kids of that kind blue dross they tend to call them that as a way of saying they don't matter as much as kids from a normal background so we don't give them as much attention we also know because of their sexuality that often that means the police don't take enough notice of the violence in gay men's lives  even when police were alerted to gaze his sadistic behavior they failed to act  on a night in March 1978 27 year-old Jeffrey Riggle was lured into Casey's car by his offer to share a joint he was chloroformed driven to gaze his house after being repeatedly drugged he eventually awoke sprawled under a statue in Chicago's Lincoln Park despite reporting the incident Gacy remained at large Casey's protection from investigation prosecution was this established good citizen that he'd managed to fabricate in the community where he felt a so degree he was pretty much invulnerable from accusations from young lads who were probably not thought of very well in the community he also knew that it was pretty difficult for someone to make accusations of homosexual nature and of someone who would suddenly want to torture someone this was out of context particularly out of context given his standing but John Wayne Gacy was about to make a fatal mistake  when Gacy stopped targeting young gay homeless men who weren't really part of the community but instead targeted Robert piste who was an all-american high school kid with a good family who were going to report him as missing who were going to say how is the police investigation going it was only by choosing that type of victim that really was the unraveling of Gacy 15 year old Robert peaced was considered the archetypal clean-cut all-american boy popular with his peers and loved by his close family on December the 11th 1978 he was working his regular job in a pharmacy saving money towards college he was looking forward to joining his mother's birthday celebrations that evening when she came to collect him at 9:00 p.m. he asked her to wait for a moment while he went to talk to a man who was in the parking lot about an offer of a construction job he did not return Chief of Detectives Joseph chosen Zach received the missing-persons report  this is where Robert piece worked the boy's mother came here to pick him up and when she arrived the boy told her that he wanted her to wait inside so he could go outside to talk to someone about summer work and once the boy went out the front door he was never seen again the owners of the drugstore told us that they had a contractor who was to do repair work inside of their their pharmacy they supplied us with some information pertaining to his telephone number and through the phone number we were able to determine his full name and address and that's that's the first time we ever knew the name John Wayne Gacy  detectives headed to the business man's home to question him hoping they would find the missing 15 year old safe and unharmed  Casey had a diamond-shaped window in his front door and the front part of his house was dark but there was a street lamp and a sidewalk in front of his residence and his I stood in front of his door knocking on it with the reflection of the light into the window I could see a face staring back at us  and the face faded into the darkness of the house  and as we walked along the side of the house and looked inside of a window we could see Casey sitting in a chair watching television drinking a beer  it was an uncomfortable feeling being inside his residence and he was belligerent uncooperative and seemed to seem nervous suspecting Gacey knew more than he was revealing detectives obtained a search warrant and discovered a concealed void beneath the house the crawl space was actually hidden by a secret trapdoor in a closet and one of my investigators found that and pointed that out to me  we took a screwdriver into a little crack in the floor and pried it up and when we did the whole floor lifted up and that led us into the crawlspace and I went down there with a flashlight and looked around and everything was dry and solid there was no evidence teenager Robert piste was nowhere to be found detectives placed Gacy under 24-hour surveillance when we started our surveillance Gacy initially responded by telling many of his friends that we were FBI agents that we were bodyguards but ultimately what happened is he really started to break down psychologically in a sense that he couldn't maintain his day-to-day facade of being mr. nice guy or a businessman because every time he went out his front door those are police cars sitting there waiting to follow him around despite finding no bodies at his house the police had discovered a stash of personal possessions that appear to have been collected as trophies we had started to find case reports based on pieces of ID we found on the first search warrant and identified those little pieces of identification as being missing persons who were former employees of cases  the mounting evidence convinced detectives that they should begin digging in the crawlspace under KC's house  prosecuting attorney Robert Egan was one of the first on the scene the first body was excavated and everyone was kind of standing around were you for the excavation there was a lot of water in the crawl space as a matter of fact the body had to be taken up literally out of water  the odin's technician had to reach down and feel a ribcage and then pull the ribcage up out of the water the parts were put into a body bag and as that was taking place the evidence technician that was doing the excavation was feeling down under the water and he he yelled out to us and we everybody kind of turned around to see what he was wearing and he said I've got another ribcage down here  beneath the unassuming suburban home detectives had made a discovery that would see it become one of the most infamous houses in American history  in 1978 the search for 15-year old Robert peaced had led detectives to the home of John Wayne Gacy a businessman and pillar of the local community there they discovered the remains of a decomposing body in a hidden crawl space beneath the house but that was only the beginning the evidence technician that was doing the excavation he yelled out to us he said I've got another ribcage down here [Music] the second set of remains was merely the tip of the iceburg body after decomposing body was being unearthed [Music] Gacy kept the bodies of his victims under the house it's an ideal way to remember where his victims were it's an ideal way of keeping control over those victims even after they've died  a total of 29 young men were discovered buried on Casey's property 27 of them in the crawl space beneath his home in police custody Casey began to confess he admitted to strangling all but his first victim when the investigation started the neighbors essentially were too shocked beyond belief because most of the neighbors even at that point in time still said John John would never do anything to harm anybody my son played by his house he's always had parties for the neighborhood he was a nice guy a good businessman so they the neighbors were just totally shocked I was astounded this is a hard-driving very hard-working individual this is a guy who appeared to have the social norms and the social values of the average middle American right down to the ground I certainly did not anticipate anything like that when I found out I was stunned but none of the bodies under the house was 15 year old Robert pieced his whereabouts were finally discovered in April 1979 Robert had been killed on the night of his abduction with no space left under his house Gacy had thrown the teenagers body from a bridge into the Des Plaines River three other boys had suffered the same fate  On February the 6th 1983 seven-year-old John Wayne Gacy stood trial for the murder of 33 young men well the defense argued that he was insane because he couldn't control his actions I mean obviously he couldn't control his actions he killed 33 people that we know of but as an insanity defense in a legal courtroom that's not going to hold up  prosecutor William cankle was convinced he could prove Gacy had been sane and fully aware of his wrongdoing he had underlined passages in red and his family Bible indicating his knowledge of his own guilt as a Catholic the blasphemers the idolaters the abusers of themselves with mankind shall not inherit the kingdom of God he had that underlying he had the Illinois statute book with the paperclips and underlining on the sexually dangerous persons Act you know exactly what he was doing and even knew what the consequences of it was so he never showed any remorse never any contrition no emotion of its what psychiatrists call a flat effect very narcissistic while he was all a matter [Music]  on March the 13th 1989 Wayne Gacy was found guilty and sentenced to serve 12 death sentences and 21 natural life sentences they asked him well why why did you do this stuff and he said well there were several reasons with some of the kids I was afraid they would exposed me others threatened to expose me so I had to kill that he said they were they were all just human trash that was his reason on May the 10th 1994 after 14 years on death row John Wayne Gacy was executed by lethal injection [Music] Gacy remains one of America's most prolific serial murderers but what drove him to snuff out the lives of 33 young men was the belittling and abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father the catalyst was the blood clot on his brain from his childhood accident with a swing the trigger or was John Wayne Gacy simply born to kill I don't think there's anything in Casey's background that suggests that he was born to kill my sympathy for Gacy circumstances is the homophobia is a very difficult cultural phenomenon to overcome and as a gay man Gacy must have felt it was very difficult to be open about his sexuality and whilst we must never accept responsibility for the deaths that Gacy caused what we should do is analyze cultures that regard one gender as superior to another and one sexuality as superior to another  he clearly lacked a conscience had no feeling towards others that he was very callous and cold and calculating I can only conclude that people are born with this deficit and there's no way we can change that we can't teach someone to develop a conscience if it's not there  so just imagine yourself if you lacked a conscience the sorts of things that you could get away with without feeling bad it's a conscience that makes most of us behave because we'd feel bad if you were suddenly freed of that think of what you might do  forensic psychologist dr. Helen Morrison spent 600 hours in the company of the serial killer and after his death was given permission by KC's family to have his brain examined there were no obvious abnormalities to him those men and those boys were vermin they just needed to be extinguished for no reason other than the fact that they needed to be gotten rid of 99% of serial murderers are male and this is around the world it covers all cultures it covers all socio-economic groups it covers all religious groups it covers any type of place that you can imagine in the world and yet they are so like they've been cut out with a cookie cutter they are so exactly the same so we have to assume that there is some genetic foundation it has to be a mutation john gacy was definitely born to kill [Music]", "71UToH2UrSs":

Bannon thanks for being here at this undisclosed location in Texas it's Steve Steve Steve it's good good to have you here thanks for being here here and you know you're here very specifically to talk with me about something that you and I study very very intently in its China and I'd love to just start right off the bat with asking you what do you think China's true intentions are in kind of their in their grand strategy what is the grand strategy is very simple is to be a hegemonic world power I mean you see through one belt one road you can see through made in China 2025 you can see through everything they're doing their strategy of being like the East India Company and sub-saharan Africa what they're doing the Caribbean now what they're doing in Latin America the economic war that all what we call all forces of government right all areas of government focus on the economic war against the United States their military buildup they're basically trying to close the South China Sea it is the most geopolitically ambitious strategy were saying let me be very specific the three great theories of geopolitics you've got McKenna's theory of the Asian landmass you have Mahon theory of cutting off the choke points of the world's oceans and you have speakman theory of keeping your enemy off of the Asian landmass the Chinese the only power in world history to ever try to do all three simultaneously you know Napoleon and Hitler and others tried to do the Eurasian landmass others the British and the American empires of British Empire and the American you know system we have today's built off Mohandas naval strategy and then speakman is one from the from the earlier 20th century what China is doing is with one belt one road trying to basically connect the old Silk Road all the way up to Italy's we saw in the paper today the Italian government the the guys in the five-star de Maio came back from Beijing they had a huge thing about hey we want to end we want to end the one belt one Road in Italy Marco Polo essentially left we had a vote this week in the Maldives which really rejected what they're trying to do in the Mahon strategy of taking all the naval bases and choke points throughout the world and then speakman what they're trying to do is force the united states which has been a Pacific Power off of the landmass through what they're doing the South China Sea what they're doing around Taiwan I said they want to push us back to Guam so listen they're the most people have said for years to kind of cover this a lot of Wall Street and City of London and Frankfurt crowd have kind of said oh well you know they're not Territory ambitious they've never been an expansionist power well they're a geopolitically expansionist power and it's quite extraordinary what they're doing and doing it at the same time and do you think that they're kind of let's say their newfound economic greatness or their perceived greatness post financial crisis they always believed they were kind of a second-rate power financially going into 2008 and the world seems to believe that they they were the engine of the world's growth from 2009 2018 is it is it that economic growth that they build their geopolitical assertiveness on in your opinion okay listen I think it's the you know since time immemorial the the access to the Chinese market kind of this mystery the Chinese market has always drawn in the West right whether is the British coming there at first with the East India Company or later the the China you know the China schooners from the from the United States right the China trade I was always this thing about China what we've seen and I happen to believe that the Chinese economic system is built on a house of sand and I think it's going to lead us to a greater financial debacle than 2008 ever was in the same culprits the exact same culprits that led to the financial crisis in 2008 the investment banks the commercial banks the hedge funds the government entities right the same elites that led to that financial crisis and got bailed out and had no responsibility no accountability have been the same exact actors that have exacerbated this situation in China and so yes the reason the world's elites the party of Davos the people on Wall Street what I call the IR Department of China which are the investment banks particularly goldman sachs and some commercial banks the lobbyists for China which is the basically the 25 or 30 largest corporations that deal in China today their lobbyists in Washington DC these are all about the big private equity guys like Schwartzman these guys they're all going to have to be held accountable for what went on in China what China was able to do in basically coordination with the elites in the West was de-industrialized the industrial democracies of the West both the Europe in the United States that's why brexit in 2016 are inextricably linked what it is is the exporting of Chinese overcapacity and Chinese deflation in basic industrial goods and so China has and from the Chinese point of view has been quite brilliant they've essentially taken 350 million of their people from kind of working poverty to middle class and 400 million people from abject poverty to working poverty so essentially two-thirds of their of their population because their population I really think is closer to 1.3 or 1.4 billion than what they say in 1.1 so what they've done is heroic in 30 years ok from from a from a strategy point of view but that has been exacerbated by the elites in the West who basically kind of finance it and brought it along it in fact what drop the recent Trump was I think so special he said hey this is not the way the world has to be it can be very different we've basically financed the rise of China we've built China and while he heard for years and what you heard for years is no this is the what I call the second law of thermodynamics or this is a immutable law of physics the rise of China and what Trump says no this is through human agency it's the commercial banks the investment banks the corporations the Cal toad to the Chinese regime and one thing I want to make sure how I get from front this is not about the Chinese people I have been I served as a naval officer over in China in the western Pacific in the 7th fleet on a destroyer in the late set of mid 70s I think 76 77 s first time I went to China I've been involved in China virtually all my life I've owned businesses over there I've lived in Shanghai for a while in the French Concession I have a great not just admiration but a deep love for the Chinese people in fact they have a saying over there called old hundred which is basically the common man because the hundred last surnames in China so old hundred names essentially the deplorable z-- right and those in the old hundred names is a sense of common decency the grit the determination what they've been through as a people is nothing short of heroic what we have the problem we have is we have a totalitarian regime of the Chinese Communist Party and quite frankly the leadership the the elite leadership of the Chinese counties party that are really in business with the party at Davos which is no kind of scientific engineering managerial financial cultural elite that I say kind of emanates from the from the World Economic Forum in Davos but really is in London in New York Washington DC Silicon Valley right etc and do you think do you think the way that they've ingratiate themselves into let's say the Davos man as is commonly referred to the way that they've gotten there is is it through economic coercion is that is it through investing in our universities our think tanks our lobbyists as you said and our corporations and even the people that are US citizens looking to make profits in China is that how they control that narrative and let's go let's go back let's go what did they get let's go back to in one week in January 2017 we had to I think seminal speeches okay we had the Davos speech expression she okay which was a the high Hosanna to globalism yeah and it was to me repulsive repulsive how the mainstream media and Davos man just sat there and and bought it all and said what a great leader what a great humanitarian what he's what he's going to lead us through about client you know on the world's environment what he's going to do you know for globalization or for the economy and then you saw Donald Trump's you know inaugural address was I think three days later and what she said hey we're getting back to the nation-state and America is going to start to focus on our sovereignty and other nations to start thinking about their sovereignty but this globalization of what's coming out of Davos it's stripped our sovereignty from us and we're gonna re assert that and two years later which happened this week was Mike Pence's speech about the new strategy of the United States Thursday night really really been has really been going along for quite a while which is now kind of engaging China right an engagement with China but not like Henry Kissinger and not like this acidities trap crowd and I know you did this seminal interview with Graham Allison but not what those guys want which is the kind of us stumble along and play along with China this is a you know this is a direct confrontation with China to say we're not going to take it anymore you've been an economic war with us and we're going to reassert us your question about how the aggression and stuff that the guys wrote the biggest checks in wrote checks to the universities they wrote checks they've essentially bought off the City of London in Wall Street and the corporations you know I say this in a sense of kind of anger the the great investment banks in London and in in New York became the Investor Relations Department for this regime okay in the minister suit of profit and about Tober sort of profits and corporations became their lobbyists when leha's deputy came to the United States about four weeks ago when they had this kind of last round are trying to put something together than a trade deal there wasn't much going on but he sent his deputy in a small contingent to see Stephen douche and the guys at Treasury they went to the very first stop they made was to the day before they went to Treasury they stopped and they had a meeting with I think it was fifteen or twenty a large corporations the heads of governor fairs and I think the president's not the CEOs because the guy wasn't high enough and he basically said hey boys you have a problem right and you have to figure out how to help us fix it okay another thing they had you know wine cui Shan announced this kind of financial advisory panel being on their back foot by the Trump strategy they kind of said hey we need a financial advisory panel to help us understand what the United States wants once the United States needs and it was named you know Paulson and Schwartzman and all you know all these characters and it's interesting when they need somebody to kind of come over and you know help inter mediate with the United States they go to the same guys have been profiting on this my understanding is that people came back and said hey the ung you know the UN General Assembly is happening its Opera season and in New York my schedules full and and Wayne qui Shan said hey boys I don't think you're listening we're having a meeting I want everybody show up this is this is General Quarters and so know I think that I I think when we look back on this it's going to be a people are gonna be absolutely stunned when they see how the elites right of the Western democracies and the United States went along with China and exacerbated exacerbated a situation when it was quite evident they were economic war with us yeah going back on this one issue the the way that the influence is being pushed through the corporations you know we know we at our firm know that there are several there's a couple of handfuls of corporations that each have more than a billion dollars in capital that they're trying to get back from China and they've been unable to get a dime out of China since November of 2016 when China closes capital account completely when you were in the administration did you interface with any of these companies that were going through a lot of part in the pond red tape trying to get their money out as if you listened the very first thing they come appealed yeah I think this would be a big shocker to people remember when Trump wanted a complete you know upset that nobody saw coming and particularly you have this post-war liberal democratic rules-based order okay the Chinese have done nothing but gamed the system from day one on every set of rules the rules are what they determine they are yeah okay and nobody calls them on it because everybody thinks they're too weak and so in the corporation's I think I think intermissions afraid to call them on it absolutely because they know if they say that we can't get our money out they shall be shut down shut there's a quid pro quo shut down shut down there's absolutely fear I look at when they came back on this whole by the way on the entire situation with the tariffs and tariffs is just not about tariffs in about not about protectionism that's why Trump's done it at such a scale remember before Trump got hear people talking about 25 30 billion dollars of tariffs is like oh my god that's so huge Trump's program is a half a trillion dollars in tariffs right to tariff goods because he knows that Chinese can't respond correct and here's why they can't respond people the United States have to understand one thing the Chinese look at us as a tributary state that let me explain that China's been around for 4,000 years right they've had good runs and they've had bad runs okay but one thing they know and the reason they're still organized as a nation over four thousand years right they know how to handle allies I know how to handle bad guys okay now what they've done is they got this system called barbarian management and they know how to manage barbarians the way they manage the barbarians is they take the leaders of the barbarians and they give them a taste of the good life and you're going to be you're going to be something special you're going to get a special deal now what happens back into the tributary state is whatever happens that's your problem okay so you remember in the United States what they have done for 25 and 30 years is played us as a barbarian state barbarian management okay they incentivize our elites and our elites de-industrialized particularly the Upper Midwest of this country it's the reason Donald Trump's president the audience should understand one thing is important is that you know JD Vance the great guy from Yale who wrote hillbilly allergies is the best sociological study of the Trump voter and it was JD Vance who told me says hey those studies that come at at MIT and Harvard show that there's a direct correlation between the factories of left for China the jobs are left with them in the opioid crisis because this is not an attack logic it's not about tariffs what this is about is human dignity and self-worth those factories went Wall Street made the money the corporation's benefit from it for lower cost and devil catch the hindmost on the workers and so this is what Trump is kind of totally reversed now what China seizes has is we're a tributary state we send them natural resources soy beans beef cattle Boeing Airlines and Apple products excuse me we don't send Boeing Airlines and Apple products you know why because they forced Boeing to do a joint venture and they forced Apple to make it products over there so all we we're Jamestown to their Great Britain okay that's why the tariffs at the scale that Trump put them up at they can't respond to her okay what's interesting is those it let's assume we put 25 percent on five hundred twenty billion we're literally talking about a little over a hundred billion dollars yes I know that's a lot of money yes but our economy's 19 trillion yes it's still not that functionally meaningful to us in my opinion yes but I do think it's a leveling of a field to your point it's converging they've been fighting a trade war with us since 2001 and we just haven't fought back okay the average compounded growth of the United States of America from 1946 the end of World War two to 2000 was 3.5% okay it's the reason we became a superpower that economic engine that was unlocked and grew every year three and a half percent through good times and bad on average yeah since China joined the World Trade Organization sure that's when they joined they got most favored nation the growth of the United States is 1.9 percent ok 1.9 percent and there's a lot of factors that but the central beating heart of it is China that's what because we D industrialized which Center we sent our manufacturing over there yes the tariffs in and of themselves on a nominal number an absolute number are not huge but we look at the convergence of everything what Trump has done is said hey we're at economic war and we're going to hit back over there we're gonna hit back with a 301 to stop the force technology transfers we're gonna put these tariffs into the scale they've never seen before we're gonna have the ability if we so desire to liquidate companies like ZTE to basically cut them off from their component parts in the West they'll be out of business in 90 days also the new things about investments about these limitation and investments at the surface if he is reformed that people are talking about you bring all forces of government together on that and the stopping of intellectual property you have something what Trump is done and this is why NAFTA was so important you know people mocked and ridiculed Trump there's a book out called fear that Gary Cohen the president Goldman Sachs you know great goldman sachs and i used to work there he takes he takes the documents off the president's desk the book opens where he's taken the NAFTA deal right early on in the deal on Korea he actually takes him off the desk because in his judgment right the president wasn't smart enough to understand what he was doing well here's what Trump's done the new NAFTA deal that he's he's created is basically setting up a geostrategic manufacturing base to counter East Asia okay and Japan is is very quickly going to be part of that a bilateral deal not some TPP deal or just one among many a direct bilateral deal with Japan as a partner we've got one with Korea we're updating and then the EU Younker has already told Trump his all right already indicated that they're gonna be a part of this - what Donald Trump has done in less than two years against the second law of thermodynamics right the immutable law of the rise of China right what he's done is reorient the entire world's supply chain away from China and this is going to have economic growth opportunities that are going to be incredible and he's done that kind of single-handedly against against the fighting of the the corporatist Lobby the fighting of the Wall Street Investor Relations Department etc so that's what I think it's really heroic it it's that policy is one that it's interesting at the timing if you look at just the let's say the the economic laws of China were already slowing down before we decided to fight back it just so happens to be that this pushback from a tariff or whether the most elegant idea was the board adjustable tax which is immediately killed by you and I both know I love I love them that was perfect in my opinion now by the way John I I am I am a huge believer that and I'm you know Paul Ryan I've had our differences when I first he first walked me through that I said that's the solution exactly that's a solution it's kind of a gala terian way of going at it I think I think and we all know I get crushed yeah I think that that is something that should be brought back up in and very quickly in future years we could do away with tariffs if we imposed a border decibel well Bob let's talk about turf that's like a president Trump remember at the g7 when he was lectured by his betters Merkel and McCrone on the first day you know about this whole thing about tariffs right he came back the next day for breakfast and what Trump you know what Trump told told the in the g7 he said okay I thought about it last night how about this no tariffs absolutely no tariffs but no subsidies yeah people have to realize like the White House put out this document I think it's over two months ago now the 50 things that China is doing in its economic war with us it's kind of its kind of what what do you know what the United State once trying to stop that's the deal you stop that we're all good when you look at that it's not just a tariffs it's it's it's the investment in state-owned industries remember they have baby land free electricity land what they look at what they've done is steel aluminum throughout the world look at you have a ship building you can go every heavy industry they've got it they've got it that Western Europe and they've got at the United States and they continue to do that purposefully purposely and they're also by the way there's ZTE showed you this they have to create a thing as some number of 11 million jobs a year they're under enormous internal economic pressure to create those jobs they can't afford to have 150,000 high value-added jobs as et just go away same thing with a steel they're kind of caught on the wheel now I mean there's a first amenity right because they've got to keep these guys working so I think that that's why the Chinese model and all this happy talk that comes from the West yeah about the Chinese model when you really look at it I know you are one of the world's handful of experts I think it looked at it it looks at the numbers as they really are and not what people hope they are and not how they're spun by China because every number comes out of China to me has to be questioned verified you know trust but verify has to be questioned verified and then verified again you've got to get a bell suspenders and that's why I think we're we may be hurdling to another financial crisis driven by this financial model of China that can't withstand you know can't stand up on its own right well the good news about that is if we're right about China we're right about there bill incredible bill the reckless build of credit coupled with the fact their economy slowing down coupled with the size of their banking system their GDP if we're right about all those things the good news is their banks aren't inextricably linked ours the way that ours were to Europe and Asia is back during the our financial press they're not they're not but you use the word they're reckless and I think that this is you know this is what upsets me about the lack of accountability and responsibility by the world's elites we just went through the worst financial crisis in history not one CEO went to jail and not anybody significantly gave up any equity okay what they did is basically inflate no people got to remember on September 18th of 2008 when Bernanke and Paulson walked into the Oval Office with Bush and he sent him up to Capitol Hill the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve was 880 billion dollars on the day that Donald Trump took the oath of office on January 20th the 2017 it was four point five trillion dollars all we did in in in the Bank of England ECB Bank of Japan did the same thing and what you do see pvo said what they did is to save the elites was to turn on the spigot of liquidity so if you owned assets realize if you own real estate you don't stock shown intellectual property you've had the greatest ten-year run in history if you're a working-class Schmendrick you had your wages of flat the whole burden of it this is what's unfair and this is where the anger that's driving the populist movement the whole burden comes down on the little guy to finance these deficits with his taxes that's right and then his kids get sent everywhere in the world to defend this that's what's got to stop you use a word reckless it is reckless disregard what the elites have done this time because all they've done Chinese banks look the American banking system has 19 trillion dollars of assets on it and I would respectfully submit and you're ten times smarter than me on this I would respectfully submit that all of those assets are not good okay maybe let's say ten percent or more could be written off today that's the American banking system the Chinese banking says that things has 49 trillion dollars of assets correct me if I'm wrong I think 45 trade have been put on the books since 2008 this is completely reckless now thank god they're not interconnected through the Swift system with the rest of the banks or through derivatives derivatives and by the way the reason is and this is another tell because none of the investment banks or none of the guys want to say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't hook up with China right because they all stop themselves from doing it they're all limited their exposure to understand when it implodes they don't wanna be they don't be taken down in the first couple of minutes that being said those banks are going to implode nobody can put those kind of assets on okay and have and have a great banking system here this is a total and complete sham and in the Economist and the Financial Times of London all the elites all the conference's they have you know you had Richard Haass on this morning or Morning Joe Richard Haass from the council foreign relation and all he's doing is beating up Mike Pence and Donald Trump from Pence is speechless now you know he's saying you say hey all my Chinese all my Chinese colleagues all my buddies in China they're telling me they don't know what the United States wants you know they kept you know they came over here they they want a deal and they want to be our partner but they we keep moving the goalposts that is that is reckless for him to say that he fully understands what the issues are okay and he sits there on a show a general news show in the morning that you know basic voters watch it starts putting this stuff into the mind is unacceptable I gotta tell you Kyle that's what I think what you're doing here what you're doing with your work and other things there are a number of people like yourself they're sitting there going this can't continue and people are going to be held accountable with this if the elites think they're gonna skip on this one it's not going to happen the reason Donald Trump's president the reason you're seeing these populist revolts whether it's in Italy Germany France throughout the world in Brazil this weekend okay in Argentina in Pakistan is the reason is the little guy is fed up with a group of elites that know better right into into and to take care of themselves they will play ball with anybody you're right and when you talk about that Chinese banking system let's assume that it has to restructure what they'll do they're very smart people this hold as you see and say let's talk about this here's how smart they are when we went over with Trump's visit remember they didn't make any other changes they weren't gonna listen on anything else of that except they would open up the finance sector so it says the spider to the fly exactly that they've already wrecked their financial system you can invest now you can invest it why environment is the world not see this diva the world absolutely sees this you're starting to see it hang on hang on oh you're just starting no no no no cow cow cow you you you are much too kind you're a good man okay you've got to call it like it is it's okay they know exact you're telling me the guys in the Wall Street Journal Financial Times of London The Economist these smart guys these think tanks don't know exactly what's going on usually they say like Megan look at the balance sheet of these bang to say hey guess what I think we have a ticking time bomb right but you know they say this but it's China that's what I hear all the time that's why I agree with you but it's China so we're gonna keep writing what we write yeah yeah that's got to stop China must be okay we cut a deal with them the late 90s remember you had a spectrum back then of the China cheerleaders the rational accommodationist in the Hawks okay so let's talk about this back in 99 that was the pitch from the appeasers the people have to understand as both the local parties this is not about ideology there's all Democrats and Republicans okay when they're talking about China they're just trying to figure out how to get more money in their own pockets so the cheerleader said exactly hey it's China once you get into the most favored nations once we get them into the WTO they're going to turn out to be liberal capitalist they're gonna you know they're gonna they're gonna vote economy they're gonna let us invest in everything middle class they're gonna be it's gonna create a rule of law real long all the law it's gonna be it's gonna be nirvana and they're gonna be okay so we know 17 years later guess what they're a totalitarian regime mercantilist regime they've got a system that works with them for the for the for the it for the elite for their regime and it works well now you have two sets of folks the rational company the cheerleaders are gone nobody's at earlier you have rational accommodationist and you have Hawks rational accommodation has got a new name it's the Citadis trap it's your buddy Graham Allison and Henry Kissinger and here's a great concept that guy okay the great concept is America's attic lining power China is a rising power like Sparta was a Athens was a declining power as far as a rising power and what you have to figure out to avoid a global conflict which is like 16 times in world history this has happened and 12 times they just weren't wise enough to take it what has to happen is the declining power can figure out how to nudge nudge the rising power could kind of get into their system now you're always be the junior partner but you'll make the big guy kind of work with you and everything will be happy this is the exact same nonsense from the exact same people from Allison Graham and from Henry Kissinger that they spun on Nixon in the late 60s about Russia let's go back in time yeah the same exact pitch Russia's a rising power America's a declining power and what we have to do we need date on we name rapprochement we need to let them have their sphere of influence it was then and it's now Ronald Reagan came in and said hey you know what help me is their economy and they said Russia's economy is the size of California yeah he says what a people fear him the very first thing that Andy marshaled the net assessment group in the Pentagon and Bill case in CIA did was do a complete analysis of the Russian economy and they found out it was only half as big oops I have a miss 50% bigger and they were desperately short guys that's really short of dollars this is the whole thing that always actually were China because they did the exact into China they put it into military spending that was not productive so here we go with the exact same set of guys and what they tell us 40 50 years later hey America's are the cleaning power China is a rising power and this and look at its exact same thing they have an economy with no dollars here's a point I make told how about this how about we stop being a declining power that is not a law of physics a process that manages us to decline okay is not a process I accept I am looking for a leader to step up and make America great again okay and that's Trump's basic pitch and guess what in two years he proves the Chinese are a paper tiger when you think about again their grand strategy are pushed back and where we are in in the globe today how do you think what do you think China's next step is if if you were if you were predicting what their next step would be given our assertiveness that would that we've stepped forward on the economic call it side of the other coin and pushed pushed in some tariffs and are starting to reassert ourselves what do you think they're going to do number one they won't reverse textbook they want regime change in United States they believe they have a eighty percent chance of getting Trump getting winning the house of you know doing whatever they need to do with psychological warfare with money with whatever they have to do to basically fort Trump and lose the House of Representatives Cement peach this year and 100 percent probability they'll beat him at 2020 number one is the of Donald J Trump as president I states okay because they say that is the rail head of everything has happened to us badly and we've got to get you know we've got to get a globalist in there their game their game just to wait him out not just where you might I think take active measures now yes but Penn said Penn said yesterday and Axios and other people reported this classified information this shows that this shows that the Chinese involvement in real meddling this is not some Russia guys on Facebook this is the real deal because this is all the chips in the middle of the table that's number one number two I think what you're seeing the Italian said today that that age China's gonna be our big buddy I think you're gonna see a double and triple down on one belt one Road I think you see a double and triple down on made in China 2025 I think you'll see the East India project in sub-saharan Africa at the Caribbean in Venezuela and Latin America I think they're gonna double and triple down they got a lot of RMB to spend right and if a guy can take RMB no one's gonna take well this is going to be that this is going to be the great question we're gonna have in front of us because they're in the Gulf right now there's all over the UAE they're all over Saudi Arabia they're all over Qatar they're all over every resource of area in the world from Argentina to sub-saharan Africa to to South South South Africa and they're gonna try to see it you play it then number three because remember in the great textbook that they put out and basically printed in English in the late 90s written by these two brilliant Colonels in the Chinese War College called unconventional warfare unconventional warfare Admiral ooh yeah yeah it's a it's a book that should be written as should be read by everybody is that the because it laid out China strategy they said there's three types of warfare there's information warfare there's economic warfare and this kinetic or kind of guns up warfare and what we want to do is avoid kinetic because the one thing America can do is kick your ass right so we want to avoid that okay and so let's let's focus on information and economic warfare and they from the tables I mean it's textbook you go back and read that they've done exactly what they they said they were going to do I think and I believe that given the fact that Trump is now converging all forces of government power onto the economic warfare and they are taken back and the regime is under huge pressure because I believe the Deng Xiaoping faction and others even at the highest level who believe in collective leadership have said hey what we have here is a cult of personality you mean the ones that have him in jail they're killed once I have them in jail to kill yet have sat there go Deng believed in working with the West yeah Deng believed in reform Deng believed in opening up but dang believed in being a good partner and particularly keep your lights down don't get up to somebody's grill that what what they see with with she is a return to the cult of personality of mouse and he's under tremendous pressure internally I believe I said on my radio show and everybody quotes me on this back in I think it was 2014-2015 that in five years we'll be in a shooting war in the South China Sea as a 22 year old naval officer I was on patrol in the South China Sea on an American destroyer okay and I said where in the hell am I you know what is this place because every tanker in the world coming through the Straits of Malacca yeah from the Persian Gulf you got every huge tank who get every boxcar is it's it's a superhighway ten percent of China's energy needs come through there's 40 I think it's one third of the world's tres five tree today it is my point this is a super hot one people say the South China Sea here is you got understand it's a superhighway of Commerce the biggest ships in the world 24/7 365 days a year what China did and they came to the Rose Garden in 2015 and look the American people in the American president lie and lie to him they built essentially seven or eight stationary aircraft carriers they call them resources these are stationary February's mr. Suri Scarborough reef all these these wreaths our reefs are basically aircraft carriers and what they've done is they put fire control radar search radars they've got combat planes on oh and me these things 10,000 foot runways it said about it so the United States we why did Obama so China said to us specifically when Obama was president we will not militarize our islands in the South China Sea will not go to the Spratlys everything we're building is just for research purposes why how do we how do we engage China now that we see that every single one of these islands whether it's fiery cross or mischief or the others have 10,000 foot runways and I missile batteries on them and all of the weapons that they said they never put there and now they're landing nuclear bombers there how do we engage them do we engage them over this or do we just when I when I get into the White House's chief strategist okay with Mike Flynn we first got there on the National Security Council in the transition I said the three things you got to do is is is is devolve fighting of capability to the combatant commanders get the White House was running the wars against Isis so give it to Harry Harris yeah yeah one note in this regard give it to the guys in sin comm and LEM take on Isis got to devolve come you know the power to fight wars the ability fight wars back to you combatant commanders number two we got to figure out and this National Security Council thing of the Obama appointees how we're going to get our own people in there over time number three I said we have to go back and get every document every document related related to Obama's pivot to Asia I said I want to see exactly what they looked at and people should know and in the White House I worked seven days a week 18 to 20 hours a day okay fifty percent of my time was on the pivot to Asia why Obama did it what we were going to do to count here it was Kurt Campbell's in our chamber here and here's what I found I thought it'd be a whole room full of documents it was pretty thin and what I found is that the United States itself was not really engaged institutionally against China you had some great people but there wasn't all forces that kind of thought through hate an economic plan or a war plan against China to engage in this economic war in fact what you saw the entire pivot to Asia became I think putting a marine Brigade in Darwin Australia it was basically the issue so Harry Harris was a guy every told me Harry Harris is the man so I got Harry Harris back everyone Harris back I spent you know a lot of time with him getting schooled on exactly what's going on and the one thing I found that was shocking is that the South China Sea when I was a young naval officer we went through the South China Sea guns up radars up everything moving it's called free navigation we did in international borders what we want to do when we want to do it because we're the United States Navy okay we keep the sea lanes free what I found out now is they got these reeds everything like that China we only go through and what's called safe navigation go through with your radars off no fire control solutions like a good little boy just kind of go and you're basically answering their permission ago the South Village I didn't I was on the South they consider they consider when they lost the international court china considers the South China Sea to be an internal seat of China I know they timed out at lunch and now I've got a line there's a joke they think it's what they think it's a territorial seat I know they are not prepared the first thing they'll tell you that the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of China is not to be questioned not to be questioned and they consider that non dot line you know the more people put it into documents the more people put it on TV shows the more people that reaffirm their that's reality yeah you ask me what's going to happen the South China Sea I said on my radio show of five years ago over in a shooting war the South China Sea in the situation in Qatar in the Persian Gulf in the South China Sea are the two greatest hotspots in the world for a global conflict to start okay not Korea Korea is a vassal state of China the whole Korean thing is nothing but a Chinese drama okay okay and president Trump's do an amazing job on the South China Sea is a flashpoint and you saw the other night as a former naval of sometimes those two ships what you had an American the USS 15 feet apart the USS Decatur was on patrol yeah and you basically had a Chinese destroyed come and play chicken with it fifty feet apart if those two ships had hit what would happen to it first off two or three hundred sailors would have died okay absolutely if those two ships had hit at the speeds that they were going the relative speeds were going we would have had a catastrophe okay now I don't know what could have happened to the weapons and what could happen to the fuel but I'm telling you at the speeds what the Chinese did was reckless and that was a challenge to us remember what the Decatur did was go 12 miles 12 miles to one of these wreaths okay now what the Chinese say is within 15 miles is their territorial territorial water they said it was a violation of their sovereign territory for the United States Navy to come 12 miles off a wreath that they built into the South China Sea my recommendation as I think the president ice States Donald J Trump who Tamizh been very even-handed which and really you know try to build a relationship I think you ought to give the Chinese 72 hours 72 hours to take every radar every every offensive thing on military all the Jets everything either runways everything off the islands get 72 hours take it all off and on the 72nd hour in one minute the United States Navy's gonna go in there take it off form and then I think they ought to take those reeds and they are to dismount them and turn them back into international waters that what that's going to that is good they say the United States is provocative by putting the United States Navy back into the South China Sea to keep the sea lanes open I happen to believe where this relationship is going in the lack of a real response the Chinese gonna have that they're gonna try to do something provocative in the South China Sea the China initiate a response and I think the president would be proactive on this I think you got to tell me get 72 hours if you don't take it off we're gonna take it off for you and then chatting in dare them to stop the United States Navy word going to do it wait you're saying go go to a kinetic conflict in 72 hours and I didn't say go to a tonight contract what I said what I said was if we go try to take this off they're not and they're not gonna let them well the international courts ruled that there was inappropriate for him to be there why don't we enforce that you know the party of dad was when she came when she came in and gave that great speech at tablished they all they all jumped up about they failed to say dude you just mentioned they they looked the people of the United States in the eye and lied to them from the Rose Garden in 2015 with the president states right next to him okay and nobody called him on it and never call him on and then you saw and then you saw when the international courts came and said hey this is totally unacceptable there's no argument for it it's got to be undone they just sat that what they've sat there and said hey these are our turn there's our territorial saying I realize people saying Bannen what kind of crazy whack job are you it's somewhere and we don't even know where it is in the South China Sea we're going to go to war people have to understand the global economy and I'm a nationalist okay but the the health of the American economy is based on trade you know you know populist and economic Nationals are not anti trade they're anti this radical concept of free trade when you're trading with a totalitarian mercantilist society right we want what Trump wants and what he said from day one is fair trade and reciprocity okay reciprocity and I think now we're gonna get down to it with China you know this thing is not gonna this thing is is going to China is going to have to understand that Donald Trump is never going to back down on this yeah okay he's a fair man okay he's a decent man he's tried to work with them but the days the United States being pushed around with this or over know if let me ask you a provocative question then if we were to go do give many more provocative so we're going to war in the South trying to say it's just the derivative of that we're just going to evolve along I'm actually just going the other it's it's equally as provocative what if we were to just take our seven fleet and go home here's the things that people have to remember things very important for people to remember that the United States is a Pacific Power yeah I mean the whole development this country the Transcontinental Railroad the whole West Coast the West Coast we are inextricably linked to the health of of of Asia's economy well article 5 protections of Japan would be a real issue but I know I say that because if we were to have to go to let's say we were to get to the point where we either had to go to war or had to come home coming home is not as not an option not an option not an option the world the world would be in incredibly and would get to be an incredibly dark and dangerous place you know very you could have her you could have a you know you could have a appeasement there you can have a Munich right you could have people say hey let's just pull out they built the islands they're rising naval power it's really we don't we don't want to listen one of the cores about Trump's it is non-interventionist however what America first stands for national security is where it's in the vital national security interest of the United States it will be in the vital national security interests of our local partners that's what America first means Trump is not going around the world looking for fights he's trying to calm things down with Russia he's trying to calm things down in Syria he's trying to find a solution in Afghanistan he's trying to find a solution in Korea he's trying to find a solution of Venezuela and you're your viewers should understand Donald Trump didn't create any of this this is Richard Haass and all the geniuses okay of the of the party at Davos they're the ones that dump Korea there's the ones that dumped Afghanistan in Venezuela and China on his lap what Trump is saying is that America first we're our allies of being their vital national security interests either and you go around and talk to Singapore and Thailand and Indonesia and Australia and ask them hey there's an American naval presence in this neighborhood a good thing or a bad thing and they will tell you no it's a vital thing we need America we need America here because if we lose the South China Sea we will lose any type of commerce trying to control the whole place and the Chinese understand it that's where they're trying to push us out and they're starting to already have the psychological warfare of exactly that hey it's 12,000 miles away it's really Asia what are we involved here for this is another debacle you're already hearing this is another debacle like Iraq in Afghanistan the United States is - look I'm the biggest I'm the biggest proponent of America first South China Sea in the gauge Minh twith China is absolutely vital interesting okay let's go to one other what could I have two more questions one is that why why is the u.s. not had a people management process in the US and what I mean by that is you know you read the DI UX report that I call it Declassified or actually never was classified Defense Department report on the infiltration of China into our research universities in our lab and the weapons lives weapons labs funded by DARPA the Air Force and why have why haven't we put into place a proper people management product look Russ I want you to go back because I don't think people understand these reports these reports are essentially declassified reports that showed that the 300,000 students are here on student visas right and the 10,000 contractors that we have in the weapons labs that you know up to I think it's 2/3 could be intelligence assets right right and in some percentage our intelligence officers are interest and they're working in our labs they're working our labs this is on weapons this technology is funded by our government this is political correctness and greed and avarice writ large how did contractors and let's call him at Booz Allen and McKidd all these contractors how do these contractors on these big government programs get so many Chinese nationals working into our weapons labs our weapons labs are at the cutting edge of national security how did it happen and so this has got to be done right away I don't know why it's been a huge I think bone of contention inside the administration the political correctness of it all Steve emailed the Financial Times of London leaked the other day that my colleague Steven Miller he's a terrific young man actually had the plan in place to get all 300,000 Chinese students out of the country right way to cut the visas off right away not that we're going to execute on it but it was even in the thinking and obviously it got leaked in the in The Times it goes around the State Department cetera right you might look at all the appeasers I am so glad I take great pride that someone like Susan Thornton is now you know owns a farm up in Maine because she was part of this kind of you know rational accommodationist this kind of softness in in the America in the Defense Department in the in the State Department in our intelligence services that basically went along with what try and want to do and look the other way but how do we so I'm not a proponent of throwing all their 349 thousand students here and I know you know I'm not an opponent here's where I am a proponent of if their intelligence assets I want to know that okay what Miller's program was and said hey if we can prove this they got to go home okay but and I'm not even focused directly on China or India or anywhere specifically but why can't we have a policy in with the sovereignty and national security of our own country why can't we say if it's a weapons program you just need to be an American citizen you should maybe should be a natural-born AmeriCorps answering basic fundamental questions that that actually I think that I think actually that's on the book and they get waivers I actually think that I believe that technically when you look in the details that's actually the fact there's kind of waivers given of this because people look the other way okay and so one more one more issue is the Confucius Institutes yes the Confucius attitudes are on of our colleges they're funded directly by the PLA yeah why do I colleges allow some officious instance it would be on VA would be like thee it would be like in China having something funded by the CIA that was directly half of Church Catholic Church we're not the Catholic Church the Catholic Church is kind of deal that let's try no no but there's a huge issue Pope Francis just cut a deal that lets the Atheist that run the the regime in Beijing actually pick our Bishop so the Catholic Church would not be a good idea since they've already Cal toad it would be equivalent of having CIA ad and I have a Student Center that promoted CIA culture right to in China in China yeah okay that ain't happening yeah okay you know what's not happening cuz the Chinese say hey that that's kind of that's not gonna that's not gonna happen because that may affect our sovereignty well how do so give me a better practical you gotta unwind them how I think you just sit there you got to shut them down okay right I think I don't think it's any way I do what I did I think hey this whole thing about you guys people are saying oh well they're not that bad that pushing culture and the help with students learn Mandarin hey there for dance by the PLA they have server rooms in the Confucius Institutes what that F's going oh this is gonna be a shock to the American people working people here's where the American people don't know this because nobody reports it has 60 minutes ever gone had done a Confucius Institute they should yeah but Mike they should have done it 20 years ago yeah the reason this is coming up is that people now fed up with this and that's why in this Trump movement it was Donald Trump and when he came to the government that changed it that now other people and other voices are coming up and you're seeing a real pushback but to allow this to happen at our universities I don't think that looks let's be brutally frank why is it always Hudson Institute that's having miles Kwok or last night Mike Pence you know dr. Pillsbury's there why is it always Hudson Institute why is it not the other Institute's having having you know having these kind of fun because China has has paid many of them the last thing that maybe our clothes on is when Li her that the economic strategist for President Xi yeah and I've had an opportunity to know him and build a little bit of relationship he's a very brilliant guy when he came to do the major negotiation that didn't work out I think it was in June last year he came in the very first day he didn't go to the White House at first he didn't go to Treasury first he shows up in the very first day he spent on Capitol Hill with that with the quote/unquote free traders in the Republican Party remember president Trump's the greatest blowback he got on this was the Republicans yeah it was a Republicans who went crazy all you got to do free trade you got to do free trade all the nomenclature that we've been using in regards to China it's always been the dismissive oh that's just China okay and so all the nomenclatures just been happy talk and the words don't really mean what they are and it's people like yourself as people like miles Kwok is people like dr. Pillsbury that are now starting to question this and I think you see this whole thing that from quote-unquote engagement to conference what they're pinning us on now the new thing is that engagement versus confrontation and we're being painted as the war party right we're the crazy guys want to go to war alright well we want to stop is an economic war that's been against the United States and if you look at the group that's in the you know engagement process all they've been in is being tapped along by China and these strategic economic dialogues that didn't go anywhere for 25 or 30 years and put us into the place where we were dee industrialize by a predatory by a predatory power and then China's predatory capitalism is what they stand on it so I think I couldn't be prouder that President Trump and I think that speech for people have not seen that speech that speech is gonna go down in history as an inflection point because Mike Pence yesterday the vice president I states essentially threw down and said hey no more games we understand what you're doing we understand what you're up to we understand you have every force of you have a full force of government against us and we're gonna counter that and we're gonna win I appreciate that and you know this goes back to when you pull into the Commerce Department right above the entryway were you drive through if you've seen this there's a quote from Benjamin Franklin it says Commerce must be fair and equitable and I think that's where we need to be I don't think we should be overly punitive I don't think we should be combative I think we should say we just need a fair shake at things and what you're saying is there had just we haven't had one and that's something we believe to and the good news is as I think in the last six months to a year culminating with Pence's speech a couple of days there actually a day ago is finally the narratives changing despite all of the efforts from from those in China so thanks for being here today thanks for sharing this with us it was really really undisclosed location I mean we're here with miles beyond the school you know we got a key suppose live-streaming it's constant so I don't know who's more controversial you or miles but uh we'll see soon miles is a whole different league I'm junior varsity compared to that thank you thanks for coming thanks for having me",

east of downtown is San Bernardino the largest county in the come mental us it stretches from LA to the Arizona State Line yet it has only two million residents it's uninhabited I mean there's just nobody living there it's just a big massive area it's also an escape through those that don't want to be found if you want to be left alone to do whatever you want you go out to the desert San Bernardino coming is a lot of empty desert so it's very easy to to make a body disappear but do one gag it's home  the Vagos outlaw motorcycle club their 500 members make them one of America's biggest biker gangs now we use the fact that they're a member of the Vagos does intimidation they do commit robberies they do commit home invasion robberies they commit raves they commit murders the image that they put forth is one of the classic motorcycle gangster they expect to be treated that way and feared that way whether it's motorists coming down the highway or patrons of a bar or restaurant the Vagos demand one thing I want my respect is are you gonna give it to me or I'm gonna take her from you this Vagos member sniper has to have his identity concealed  there's something done you need to someone killed you needed someone up and come to me and it be done sniper started living the gang life at age nine I was a little time higher while Ronald a lot of shootings are going around with three boys oughta murder-for-hire and all regret it don't ponder on it I can still sleep at night by 1994 he joined the Vagos and started putting his violent ways to use for the gang I didn't do it because I heard so I did it because it was fun for me if someone gets out of line you just bought put a captain up that's it you know and you've talked no one's gonna be there looking at shooting you the gang use this ruthless mentality to its advantage if there's a witness your witness chop them up do what I have to do  the victims of the Vagos include gang members civilians for anyone who owes them money or shows disrespect but they reserved their most brutal treatment for snitches we call Moreau talking bird you have all these different phrases that's not a beatdown that's that's straight you're gonna shot the bongos permanently silenced informants and get rid of all evidence heads and enhance they got drop them with acid it dissolves skin so you have it all the solves easy now you break it up you dried it down you know it's it's ashes but from the arms legs and torso there I started cutting out pieces that were small enough then a bird Neal crow you know ants will either  to cross the Vagos is a risk they might put the boot stone with four or five different members kicking somebody they might you know who knows stick a gun in their face there's a lot of ways to terrorize people lo some Vagos associate is one of the few willing to talk about the gang despite the consequences  I'm not really worried about retaliations you know people get retaliated on for little things major things lonesome was recruited by a Lagos chapter president in 2004 after serving time for a felony when they seen the tattoos that I had they knew that I'd been in prison and they were looking for someone like that pretty much just another fag like they were the Vagos also liked his fearless attitude somebody's a to handle business somebody wasn't afraid to do things that they they were involved in anything illegal anything dangerous lonesome thrived in the gangs most lucrative business trafficking stolen motorcycles gary club they need money and so what started out to be was buying up stolen harley-davidson and then it just escalated he was quickly promoted from thief to assassin my reputation was was basically you know it's gonna be a pit bull just you want somebody wack no problem you know just dead big deal but lonesome had another alliance he was secretly working with the feds to gather information that was wearing a wire and if I wasn't wearing a wire I stayed in close contact with detectives lonesome is a professional snitch deep ties to the law I've been working with the law enforcement for about 20 years this nternet done for a long time and something I was good at the stakes couldn't be higher they're willing to kill you know whatever they had to do to survive somebody stand in the way something happened to that person lonesome isn't the only vago could double-cross the gang  one of their most notorious snitches is all Mona's aka hammer a high-ranking Vagos officer  he was drawn to the gang by the motorcycles and the outlaw lifestyle he was a pretty violent guy you know got a lot of conflicts he had quite a drug habit which got him into a lot of trouble but hammer was not the dedicated soldier most thought he was hammer provided some very useful information without that information we would not have been able to proceed like we did I don't think that anybody really ever suspected that you know he would work with with law enforcement Bob Lisa is a former agent for the California Department of Justice he says hammer agreed to work with him in 2000 because the gang no longer had his back he told me yeah and you know I every time I got arrested no one helped me I had to come out and you know start all over again so he was it was pretty better he was angry tired of the life hand in the said you know they want to go back to present risa convinced the biker to turn state's evidence and gather intelligence on the Vagos hammer then used a video camera to record the gangs activities yes cut cut out a CD hammer was an officer in his chopper and had complete access as such he was able to monitor their activities by both recording him photographing he videotaped some of it and provide that back to ATM  the video provided the DOJ with evidence about the gangs illegal activities including gun trafficking and drug running oh yeah Vagos drug of choice methamphetamine they were lying a lot more on the methamphetamine trade from Mexico coming into the United States and then transporting it from there I got four ounces of meth after I cut it all up and I sold it I kept a good half ounce for me to keep me going you know I do a few lines of meth and drive for hours the gang does these things for one reason money  July 23rd 2004 the Vagos got a tip about a major drug deal going down with a man named John a person who had a lot of money was looking to do a large-scale drug deal with a local Vogel member who was supplying drugs at the time in large quantities he was asked to wait at this friend's house it was kind of a mutual gathering place the Fargo's decided to take advantage of the situation and sent to members 26 year-old Daniel Foreman and 27 year-old Ryan Madison to take care of business to boggle members were pretty much assigned to go to the residential robbery knew that he was gonna have the money they stormed in hoping to steal the cash to toggle members in at home masked his arm and asked which one of you is John the two men inside neither one of them were John because John had taken his money in on home he enraged the gang members threatened the men at gunpoint the younger the Chairman mr. Gavin got him tried to run for the door the gangsters weren't about to let the man escape Foreman opened fire the shooting of mr. Gavin was a demonstration of power and authority in that situation Rowland don't go do you know  San Bernardino California this little-known town is one of the most all-american of cities it's the birthplace of the Golden Arches the most American of restaurants but this town is also home to something a little less pure  really the birthplace of the biker culture route 66 goes right to summer at the Hollanders right to Accord all started their name Vagos this outlaw motorcycle gang has called this stretch of road home for nearly 50 years  when you're driving down the street and you see a packet 50 Barlow's passed by you you're gonna move out their way that there's a sense of fear and you're not going to do anything to disrespect them  today's motorcycle craze grew out of World War 2 Harley Davidsons were military machines and the men that wrote them couldn't leave them behind when they returned to civilian life but society wasn't ready for bikers they were kind of looked out as Outsiders from the general public they didn't fit in really anywhere and Muslims were more cycle enthusiasts and they band together and form these clubs which later turned into games the first californian motorcycle clubs were just about riding their names booze fighters and the pissed-off bastard son Purdue or PO Bob's tell their story these bikers embraced the outlaw image it was just the culture of the hot rod the culture of the motorcycle it all started in Southern California and that's the draw to the a la biker community to Southern California in 1947 this lifestyle hit the maize dream they had an annual run up in Hollister California you know drink and party and ride their motorcycles the booze fighters and the PO gobs kind of a drunken brawl and was arrested and jailed the mob went crazy rioted for three days and the calling for outside help get him under control the riot made national news  the gloves became known as the one-percenters the American Motorcycle Association released a statement saying that 99% of the people that ride motorcycles are law-abiding citizens and it's the 1% that are the outlaws the incident inspired a movie starring Marlon Brando called the wild one the outlaws started to enjoy this Hollywood status people wanted to know where it all started and they all tried gravity over their memberships in the clubs exploded and new ones formed overnight in 1948 the Hells Angels established their first chapter in San Bernadino they shared the roads with another biker gang the psychos the two founding members were Latino at the time Latinos were really unrepresented for lack of a better term and the biker culture there was a few but essentially was dominated by you know white males in 1965 some members of the psychos unhappy with the gang broke off to form their own Club the Vagos were born bottles is a Spanish term meaning vagabond or wanderer so that's how they started the Vagos are a spin-off gang predominantly Hispanic motorcycle gang the Vagos embraced the counterculture lifestyle in the 60s and 70s were a lot easier easier time for bikers they could go where they please without much attention as long as they weren't raiding or workers but the bongos weren't just out to have a good time by the mid-1960s the gang had begun to build a methamphetamine empire that was raking in a considerable amount of money  you know the bikers that was your drug of choice out there in the desert in the middle of nowhere is where they were operating all the meth labs they've used different methods different locations to cook their dope whether it's in a mobile home or on a bus buried underground they move a lot of dope a lot of tons from telephony the videos from California Oregon from California to Washington the Vagos also began what would become their biggest business running shop shops they're stripping down the bike switching the numbers on them and selling the bikes and exporting them out of the country they gonna be talking in the millions you know how many bikes have they stolen and sold how many drugs have they sold you know how many people have they robbed just a lot of money  the gang began to recruit new members to help with their growing businesses  one was Paul Moniz nicknamed hammer Neela's do some Orange County a gearhead like motorcycles fast cars very outgoing personality had a bigger-than-life kind of personality you know hammer enjoyed the biker life parties women drugs and the reputation as an outlaw I would ask them why did you join the club and he said man I just love the lifestyle man I could do whatever I want all the women I wanted travel anywhere he's like it hi then in 1998 hammer was sentenced to 16 months in prison for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell once behind bars he felt abandoned by the gang when he went to prison you know they came in and took his motorcycle to call it belongings he felt sort of betrayed Agent Bob Brezza turned him into an informant with one small favor real bad abscess tooth actually exploded in his mouth and he look now I gotta go to Dennis I got no money so I got him some money goes to Dennis hammer new being a snitch could cost him his life was an informant such as hammer they live in the constant fear of being dealt with being hit being murdered every dad you wake up and you have to think about somebody put a bomb under my car we had that conversation I said look if you do this we'll make sure that we keep you safe as safe as we can hammers started informing by phone but soon he was filming illegal acts for authorities he was handing the camera off to all the members like a community camera and you know so we got some some pretty great video Oh Paula its information to be able to view a meeting or to listen to see how they plan their operations any criminal activity that that they're planning to do the feds began building drug and weapons cases against the gang but another case quickly grab their attention  October 28 2000 call Tangela for Nia 20 year old Marcus Aguirre was hosting a late night Halloween bash when Zachary Lena a Vagos prospect or new recruit and two others decided to crash the party they arrived the homeowner didn't know them they were a little rowdy he hasn't leave it's clearly a sign of disrespect they're telling that person to leave how dare you disrespect the Vagos two of the men grabbed Aguirre and pinned him against a wall Maina pulled out a knife in Prospect stabbed him actually followed him out into the street before he collapsed Aguirre was nearly gutted with the knife before he bled to death in the street the Vagos members were all arrested Maina was convicted of murder the two other Vagos were sentenced to six years for manslaughter  by 2002 the Department of Justice had seen enough they arrested more than a dozen members of the gang in a sweep called Operation Gemini much of the evidence was gathered through the cooperation of hammer we testified against a number of those members in open court and they were well aware by the end of the case the first ones that have been talking about them operation Gemini ended with more than a dozen convictions solidifying the Vagos status as a criminal street gang but the trouble was just beginning for hammer after cases had been concluded it's not over for those informants they're constantly looking behind their back checking to see who's following them the Vagos quickly put a price on hammers head they hit out on Hamelin if I want to post his photo up with a local website and wanted him found and killed repeater bullet costs $2 you're right you feel you're talking to the cops your does not murder  San Bernardino California  this desert city is ruled by a ruthless key that takes no prisoners the bar goes the gang has a motto Limbaugh go tie bar go Leonardo da buckles it's all pretty much like bloody and bloody I'll type thing you know it's a reminder to live the Buccos way or pay the consequences  neva goes treat their bikes like sacred items you're not allowed to touch another bullet point that's like his his prized possession for example he gets arrested you're not even allowed to ride his bike home you have to tow it home for the only thing more important is the gangs colors the Magos call the jackets that hold their patches cuts cut would be the denim vest that they wear with their patch on the back the gang claims certain territories using a traditional bottom rocker the rockers indicate their geographic location and then their patch other patches and emblems that are badges of honor for them insignia such as patches and tattoos are key to the identity of the Vagos it is what advertises who they are to the public it is what instills the fear the Vagos logo is the Norse god of mischief Loki is the Garda mischief and that kind of coincides with the club are the gains beliefs imagine driving down the road and all of a sudden here comes a column of 40 50 60 motorcycles and what are they wearing they're all wearing the same color and with these demonic looking patches though the majority of Vagos are white gang's colors are a nod to their Hispanic roots colors the boggles are actually the colors of the Mexican flag you know the green on the red the Vagos also have a strict set of rules that they live by gold bylaws the vitals are very structured and formal criminal street gang they have bylaws that rule their behavior they have a national and local structure has a present vice present sergeant-at-arms  women are considered to be property and are viewed as less important than bikes or gang colors oh yeah it's your club whatever it is your club your bike and then is your property that's your your will be power Vagos women whom they refer to as old ladies wear patches that identify them as property of the gang pay for the vo well that's bubbles a lady and they put out property of in whatever your name in the back some of the rules that the Vagos go by are you're not allowed to have sex with another members old lady without first game permission from that member some women are given even less respect than old ladies these women are called turnouts  turnouts which means are essentially community property so you know if they're there and you want to get with them you can they don't have any say that's a reality of you know their place in the club turnouts are literally up for grabs I mean women were just you know women or women I mean they don't mean nothing you know you can pass them around you can you know buy them from each other or whatever it's basically you know they're hookers Tom  the bongos are also backed by support gloves that they allow to hang around the gang the bongos have support clubs throughout the state throughout the country that will support them in runs and rallies and identify themselves as associates of the Vagos motorcycle game they are part of what's known as the green nation and they pay dues to the Vagos  only full gang members can wear the Vagos colors prospects must go through a hazardous initiation period while they believe that they're coming into this Brotherhood that they're coming into power that you're going to be treated equally among the other members and that they'll get a piece of the pie the prospects are seen as a lower form of being the baggage treat their recruits or their prospects as slaves washing dishes picking up their kids after school pick up the laundry in their way they goes and handle stuff carry the guns carry the drugs whatever's asked period you have to do there is no time limit on earning a batch prospects must simply prove they deserve it remembers like sniper there's no moment quite like the one when they earn their patch like when you're looking you want a certain biker sure toy and finally your dad gets it for you and your oh yeah yeah that's that's how it was for me and I was out for like three days straight just fly my fellows around going I was I was happy this rare video from 2000 shows an actual Vagos membership ceremony they'll have a formal kind of a ceremony where the patch holder better be prepared to stitch that patch on right that man there's got about five minutes sold them things on selling them on a giraffe's on prison  many Vagos wear patches with the number 22 number 22 in vago culture represents the letter v in the alphabet B being the 22nd they will put their 22s on rings on patches spray-painted on their gates even have one boggle member who painted his house numbers green and put them in the shape of a letter V they also use the number 13 which stands for the 13th letter of the alphabet M and depending on preference marijuana or methamphetamine nevados generally will wear it at a mostly upright position for if you're still using or dealing either of those drugs and upside down if you're not the gang also Awards wings for sexual acts that are witnessed by other members the acts are signified by the color of the wings anything that you do in the club you get a patch for it you know the dirtier things you do then or the filthier then that's the kind of patchy kit  Vagos also get permanently patched by tattooing certain emblems directly on to their skin the by levels you find what tattoos you can wear like to get a heart patch you know tattoo over your heart of Bhagat at I think it was five years or ten years some patches are reserved for only the most hardcore members the low-key head as well as MF representing their willingness to engage or having engaged in assaultive behavior I love their B's but that's what we've done something for the club I collect their boss 45 of those things the digital universe sniper admits to killing multiple people in order to gain the coveted a map patch if I can estimate how many people are are taking turns for the Volvos I'd say about between 35 to 38 people I've dealt formal  so keep below the radar the gang encourages members to take off their colors when they're committing crimes or when police are close by you know law enforcement heavy in that area or something like that you keep your patch covered up you know that just brings down heat especially if you're carrying drugs or our guns or anything like that I wouldn't even wear my colors when I go to throw you you know you wouldn't even know it's me or culture you where you're at and purple in your head Oprah gives a car and rebel - sniper it's not just about keeping his identity hidden I would never do dirt with the person  I care about it too much to dirty it like that I don't want to put blood on it in other words the Vagos don't want literal dirt on their colors either they have a law that says never let a patch hit the ground in the fight your colors aren't supposed to hit the ground if you see one brother getting into it with somebody than and you're there then you better back them up the gang expects prospects in particular to ensure this never happens they will react immediately and as a group especially if there are local cues or baseball bats but there's one rule the Vagos hold more sacred than all others no snitching to them snitches are less than human performance to be exterminated the Vagos don't like rats see the t-shirts that say snitches get stitches when they think they have somebody that within that might be informative law enforcement they have acted out violently that has ended in the death of these people  July 2004 San Bernardino County California to Vagos armed with guns invaded a home hoping to steal drug life they're gone to take some money from a man who was waiting to purchase dope when they arrived at the house the man they intended to rob was not there instead they found two unarmed men and no money frustrated they interrogated the men at gunpoint without warning one hostage James Gavin bolted for the door the first Mogollon line shot him in the back gavin stumbled to the front yard then collapsed his body was later found there by emergency personnel the fact that mr. gavin ran despite those commands and orders his shooting therefore was in reaction to to show that they were in charge  the gang members fled within a few weeks authorities received an anonymous tip identifying the shooter they arrested the Vagos member but dropped the charges opting to build a bigger case against the gang one of their prime informants hammer had provided deep throat information for years but hammer now had a price on his head and was no help to authorities this was years later that the bottles were still looking for him they were upset and he cried him as disloyal he was not a brother who was never a brother now authorities turn to another informant lonesome lonesome was considered a trusted member of the gang and was privy to their most heinous crimes oh it definitely thought I was a complete winner of a saint killer somebody that knew how to handle himself and they wanted to use my talents for their purposes  in October 2004 the Vagos asked lonesome to be part of another home invasion the plan was to meet at a tattoo parlor in Sacramento the Vagos chapter president yak-yak was there to give the thieves their mission yeah and they were talking about this guy had a lot of money and had a lot of weed but they wanted to kill the guy take his money kill his girlfriend if she was there yak-yak and the Vagos suspected the dealer was holding $300,000  lonesome was told to find and execute him  that afternoon lonesome spotted his target leaving a local store but reported back to yak-yak that he had lost his target in traffic I came back to the tattoo shop they had found out that this guy had been tipped off by detectives that he was gonna be killed there was a hit out on a murder he was gonna be robbed and murdered the Vagos realized they had a snitch in their ranks who's the rat um whether they knew there was a rat or not they didn't know where this information was coming from  yeah Jack called loathesome to his home for a private meeting when I got this house he wanted to leave all the phones on the table you know he's got a gun it's got a shotgun yak-yak began padding lonesome down looking for a wire yeah squats down and has a shotgun across his knee and that's when he's patting me down and that's probably why holding that shotgun across her he might have missed that one piece of the wire I had lonesome was wearing a wire that somehow went undetected it was a close call I was just ruined ratted out right to the end like I said if his fingers brushed it and it was one right there it could have been all bad for a minute yak-yak was convinced lonesome wasn't a snitch he gave him a new assignment asking him to take out another member big wood who was one of the leaders best friends it was green on yaks part totally yak-yak wanted big wood killed because he had just scored a huge drug deal and was holding a lot of money he wanted somebody to literally blow big woods head off you know and he didn't want you know he didn't want him to be able to see his face during a funeral this surveillance video he's of the gang members planning the hit what I do this part his mom made him go recognize them in honor me they had maps where he stayed at where he lived at where he parked his vehicle at where I catch him and if anyone was around him they'd have to get killed too this video also gave law enforcement a key piece of evidence when members began admitting on camera that they were part of a criminal organization we call motorcycle club and we're not as now right to the police in the papers or aa motorcycle game yak-yak and as hired killers were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder the heat was never carried out but the gang suspected there was a rat among them they had to film you know relatively quickly then in 2006 the feds launched a plan to clear out the outlaw bikers for good more than 700 law enforcement agents in five counties simultaneously raided vago homes executing 63 search warrants they rounded up 25 members in a pre-dawn sweep known as Operation 22 green when gang members are brought into a command post at 6 o'clock in the morning still in their pajamas and they're looking at around at the amount of law enforcement officers present and are confronted with the nature of the investigation they clearly were surprised caught up in the sweep where Daniel Foreman and Ryan Madison the two men responsible for the 2004 murder of James Gavin  Foreman was convicted of murder and sentenced to life behind bars Madison flipped on Foreman testifying against him in exchange for a lighter sentence operation 22 3 was a major blow to the gang but there was no guarantee the informants wouldn't face payback they right field you're talking to the cops you're done I'm the one who's coming after you you know no one else I tell you if I have to you know I kill your wife your kids it's just the way it is  San Bernardino California March 2006 the Fargo's were rounded up in a pre-dawn raid dubbed Operation 22 Green leading to more than a dozen convictions the gang had suffered its worst blow in 40 years but its members quickly turned their attention to the cause of the takedown the ATF operation had drastic effects not only on membership the structure of their of their chapters trust amongst themselves immediately you could tell the looks in the room were who's the rat smooching is particularly disrespectful the bottles won't stand for it like we talked about snitches get stitches the Vagos never forgets snitches and after testifying against his brothers hammer was looking over his shoulder people like hammer they're hanging themselves out there you start providing information against a group that you know us is a very violent group and they will make all attempts to come back for you the bongos were still looking for him they were very very upset hammer relocated to Arizona he hopped on a full house in a secluded area started working locally in that city and I told he's pretty handy guy through a hard worker I mean I tell you what he you know later he started a new life but was never able to kick some of his old habits one morning in 2007 his old police contact Bob Risa got a phone call from hammers girlfriend she'll cry and yesterday you know he's dead and and she'll just crying and told me oh my god you know I think he overdosed on drugs he helped bring the club down he felt bad about that despite the fact that these people would want him dead because they were his friends before he got into trouble when word spread of hammers death so did the rumors and we got high for a long time and he knew drugs you know but I just seemed a little suspicious to me I spoke with other members who said that uh you know he had been murdered he had been given a hot shot I don't know any of that to be true  lonesome decided not to go into hiding they had no idea ah they're being wired up anytime that I was around them you no one's ever approached me not one time about it anywhere he has never come face to face with the Vagos since then and says he doesn't fear retribution from the gang I'm not worried about retaliation because if they were gonna retaliate that had held that and I've never known about it he does wonder what might have happened if he had not become an informant had circumstances been different had I not worked with law enforcement had I'd really went into this and was going to do this when it comes time to get paid that $30,000 was I up to get a bullet in the head  sniper says he stepped away from the Vagos a few years ago angry with the gangs leaders the final straw was when they canceled a hit at the last second I will sit up you hope to take them all and then on the last minute they called it off I lost Lonnie what they were gonna give you and really pissed me off you know cuz there was a new rifle I bought and I really wonder sniper says Vagos leaders didn't take it well when he gave back his patch I leave my colors on the table finish it all you can't go it's not that easy it's gonna cost you 15 grand or your wife sniper pulled out his Glock 40 can cock it I said what you're gonna get some of your fitzy grabber bike you're gonna catch someone older than your head right now so you let it be an honor to be we're done hi Jerome walk out numbers nothing from him again Oh sniper has parted ways with the Vagos he says he's willing to continue carrying out hits for the right price at the right gang I haven't killed anyone I still don't know how I gonna work everyday if I fly collars one day I don't know what they're gonna be  the Vagos continue to fly their colors intimidating everyone who crosses their path on the desert roads of San Bernardino and the streets of Los Angeles they're gonna be around the Vagos
