xrhIAf5Pdfc,"We’ve heard a lot of hype about 5G  And today,  we are going to expose some truth  and find out about what it’s really about  What is the 5G cellular network and what exactly is it capable of  What does the equipment and hardware looks like  And what should you watch out for  And the most important questions  Is there a deeper agenda behind 5G  And how does that relate to things like mind control and energy weapons  Find out now  On today’s edition of Edge of Wonder  The truth about 5G  Welcome to Edge of Wonder.  We’re you’re hosts.  I’m Rob.  And I’m Ben  It seems that everyone is talking about 5G in the recent months  and we’ve been seeing it all over the news.  Many of yalls have been requesting it in the comments and in our inboxes  Today we’ll finally going to put this one to bed.  In part one of our two part series,  we’ll go far and cover what 5G is and everything that it’s capable of…  Causing cancer? Controlling consumer behavior? 5G weapons? We’ve got a great episode for you today.  Let’s get our everyone on the same page.  What is 5G?  5G is the fifth generation wireless technology  that’s currently being developed and implemented around the world to replace 4G LTE.  Get this, it’s supposed to be 100 times faster!  5G relies on higher frequency waves like millimeter waves  to support faster speeds and improve your mobile experience.  You’ll see faster download and upload speeds.  And for men, it’s so fast your beards may even burn off while your using it.  Maybe.  The delay in communication between devices and wireless networks known as latency will decrease.  5G is low latency.  What’s the current state of 5G cellular technology?  According to the FCC, 5G will operate on three different spectrum bands in the US.  There’s Low-band, Mid-band, and millimeter wave (high band).  You can think of these spectrum bands as the roads and data transferred as the cars on the road.  The straighter and more direct the road,  the faster that cars can drive on it.  The same analogy applies here.  Without going into too many specifics here,  basically, these higher frequency waves can’t travel as far.  Sort of like how at home you have to be close enough to the wifi wireless device to get a signal.  5G stations can only cover less than one square mile  so it’ll only work with a expansive network of antennas on top of existing infrastructure.  What does this technology look like? What should you be looking out for?  If 5G has been rolled out in your neighborhood,  you might see microcells or small boxes hung on an existing telephone poles,  street lights, or off a side of a building.  You also might notice that you grow another head,  or your leg falls clean on your midnight 7-11 slurpee run.  You know you still drink those.  So, in order for cell phones and other devices with 5G capabilities to communicate with these 5G small cells,  they will need a 5G chip.  Qualcomm released its new Snapdragon X55 5G modem  which can run on 2G through 5G  and promises to “significantly boost the speed, coverage, and responsiveness of wireless networks”  That was a mouthful,  It was.  5G will support autonomous vehicles, additional surveillance cameras,  remote controlled heavy machinery, advancements of internet of things.  Our community probably already understands where this is going… surveillance,  remote controlled heavy machinery,  super smart appliances… but we’ve only scratched the surface.  Let’s just introduce Hal and the Terminator into our homes.  Isn’t that basically what we have with Alexa and Amazon thing  Like turning on by itself, doing weird things?  Exactly  So at best, Edge of Wonder videos will load faster on our phones and at worst,  big brother is watching you or we should say deep state in this case?  No no no, it’s not like that.  Let’s go one level deeper.  I mean I’ve been alluding to it … How does 5G actually affect the people,  Ben?  In an appeal to the United Nations,  over 240 scientists and doctors with published research from 41 nations  listed out the side effects of exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic ﬁelds or EMFs.  I have no idea how you survive that paragraph  What falls under the category of EMFs? EMFs include radiofrequency radiation (RFR),  cellular and cordless phones,  their base stations, WiFi broadcast antenna, smart meters, and baby monitors.  I mean BABY MONITORS?! Ugh …  How do these EMFs affect us? “Eﬀects include increased cancer risk,  cellular stress,  increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages,  structural and functional changes of the reproductive system,  learning and memory deﬁcits, neurological disorders,  and negative impacts on general well-being”  General well being, I mean this just sounds terrible.  Even the Epoch Times highlighted an occurrence where one hundred and fifty dead birds fell out of trees  and onto the ground of a park in The Hague,  Netherlands due to a nearby 5G network antenna.  Dr. Martin Pall, professor emeritus at Washington State University and a leading EMF expert,  spoke at the National Institute of Health about the dangers of 5G.  He expressed his concerns that “EMF effects will lead to existential threats to our survival”.  Existential?  The top three among them being reproductive effects,  neurological or neuropsychiatric effects,  and the germ line mutation effects.  Why is it so concerning? It’s because these effects are cumulative.  When the effects compound to become more severe.  They become ultimately irreversible.  So basically our legs fall off and we grow additional heads.  So it’s very possible that technologically advanced countries to “suffer catastrophic drop[s] in human reproduction.”  And that to us,  sounds like a page out of Agenda 21 or the Deep State’s depopulation agenda.  The Michigan Safe Technology YouTube channel shared a clip from a legislation hearing  where Dr. Sharon Goldberg talks about the electromagnetic radiation  that causes deterioration of mental health as an epidemic leading to suicides, shootings, and opioid usage.  What are the effects on our environment or on animals?  “a detailed long-term field monitoring study was performed from 2006 through 2015  in the cities of Bamberg and Hallstadt, Germany.”  What they found was that the trees in low radiations areas showed no damage while a statistical analysis revealed that  “electromagnetic radiation from mobile phone masts is harmful for trees”  Even trees are affected! Another review by Alfonso Balmori also measured how exposure to electromagnetic radiation,  a form of environmental pollution can harm wildlife.  These animals suffer deterioration in health and reproductive issues—ultimately leading to a decline in animal populations.  But hey faster downloads and uploads right  So no animals and plants aren’t an exception.  What about humans? Exactly.  They’re endangered by the rapid development of electromagnetic radiation caused by cellular technology.  We just discussed examples of how electromagnetic frequencies like 5G can affect our health,  but is there an even more nefarious agenda behind 5G?  5G promises super fast data transfer which can accelerate different implementations of the internet of things  “Architects of 5G envision a world where pill bottles,  refrigerators,  hair brushes” will use small antennas that connect to a IoT network  Why would we ever need that?!  Some examples that might require 5G are pantry items that text you when you’re low in stock at home,  smart appliances that adjust to your behavior,  self-driving cars that can anticipate your schedule.  So basically you just stop thinking at all and be completely controlled by your device.  Yeah I’ll be sitting there drooling from brain inactivity and I’m going to need a text next time I have to use the bathroom.  Beep beep Rob you have a bowel movement  Haha right! All these “smart” things are additional data points  that a company can collect to understand and predict consumer behavior.  This is reminiscent of William Cooper’s concept of economic shock  testing which we’ve referenced in our deep state series.  Cooper describes economic shock testing as the phenomenon where “prices of commodities are shocked,  and the public consumer reaction is monitored.”  So when staples such as “beef, coffee,gasoline, or sugar” will suddenly spike in price or availability,  people will also drastically respond to that change.  These shock waves can be monitored through “changes in advertising,  prices,  and sales of that and other commodities”  and “interpreted theoretically by computers”  so that the psycho- economic structure of the economy is thus discovered.”  Basically, you can manipulate people to do certain things by understanding their relationship to the economy.  Economic shock testing tries to convince the public that certain “experts”  “should take control of the money system and reestablish security  (rather than liberty and justice) for all.”  I mean they’ve been doing this with ads and all of these stuff for years right  But now they have tools that can actually help them hone this even more  So we are aware that this stuff has been going on forever you guys  Facebook hack  Amazon  While the government already has a pretty good grasp of a macro trends in consumer behavior,  the internet of things and 5G will give detail to consumer behavior that they never had before.  So again, we touch upon more mind-blowing concepts  from William Cooper’s Behold a Pale Horse in our deep state series.  If you haven’t checked that out yet, it’s a series you don’t want to miss,  so go back and watch that after this.  Some of the helpful or convenient solutions brought out through the internet of things actually seem kind of invasive…  Now here might be one of the most disturbing effect of 5G.  We’re still unraveling this one ourselves.  Do you guys remember our “Voice of God” mind control technology video?  Dude where have you been? Go watch! It’s nuts.  We mention in a previous episode a while back,  how the voice of God technology could use cell phone towers  to send out these signals via these psycho-electronic weapons.  There’s a few more patents related to 5G that we should expose.  Hendricus G. Loos’s patented a method to manipulate a subject’s nervous system  when they’re near a device emitting electromagnetic fields.  Well this just sounds Hendriculous.  Get it …  Yeah that was bad  Well epic name aside,  this patent describes how a computer program can routinely pulse a frequency  from a monitor to affect the subject’s nerves.  The application status of this patent is still active,  which means it’s possible a company to potentially implement 5G technology  to induce certain behaviors and reactions in people this year.  That name definitely sounded too funny to be real  You mean it was rather Hendriculous?  Yes and you know what,  some folks speculate that it may be a pseudonym for Professor Ross Adey—Who was Professor Ross Adey?  Well, you’ll find many things online about Professor Ross Adey.  In his obituary,  it says that he was “a leading and controversial figure on the effects of electromagnetic fields”  He studied brain physiology at Oxford University and then joined the Brain Research Institute at UCLA in 1961.  There, he studied how extremely low frequencies or ELFs affect the human brain and nervous system.  Adey demonstrated how electromagnetic field radiation affects brain tissue.  Soon after,  Motorola found out what he was doing and hired him  and Jerry Phillips to “research ” effects of cellphone radiation on tissue.  From their research,  they “observed a decrease in central nervous system tumors in animals exposed to cell-phone frequencies”.  Afterwards, Motorola ended their project and downplayed the results,  but, this doesn’t make any sense…  why would Motorola end a project that reduces tumors.  Maybe just maybe they observed the opposite results like all the other scientists that we mentioned above  found that cell-phone radiation could increase tumors.  An interesting footnote to this side story is that Motorola Mobility is now owned by China’s Lenovo.  Just keep that tidbit in mind for the rest of this 5G series.  So back to the patent.  under the pseudonym Hendricus G. Loos’,  he wrote up another patent for an ” apparatus and method for generating  and containing plasma having ultra high temperatures”.  How we understand this patent is that this apparatus has the ability to “generate and contain energy at ultrahigh temperatures”  using “electromagnetic means”  Why that’s suspicious is that the company associated with this patent  is Plasmadyne Corporation which based out of Santa Ana,  California …  Sounds like Cyberdyne?  You know  Just saying  Some speculation here,  but could there be a way that the direct energy weapons starting those fires in California  and burning houses down to the ground,  as David Wilcock said, boring holes through cars,  and burning trees from the inside out could be influenced by Hendricks  Hendickry dickry ducks  Hendricus G. Loos’s technology?  Whatever that guy’s name is,  let’s just keep going  All this to say,  5G is a type of electromagnetic frequency.  Could 5G technology that’s being developed be used to manipulate people’s behavior  or be used to generate ultrahigh temperature energy to be used as a directed energy weapon?  You can find all this information publicly available on patents.google.com  and we encourage you to do your own research.  Before we wrap up, please go check out our platform, edge of wonder dot tv.

Which basically is Facebook  What Facebook is doing  I mean who’s got that data  Anyway, they already have ours I’m sure  So this 5G tech could potentially be used to manipulate your behavior  and lastly, we dipped our toes in some of Hendricus Loos’s crazy plasma technology and how 5G can power it.  There’s no way you can say that with a straight face  Can’t  In the next episode,  we’ll talk about the 5G battle,  the cold war between the alliance and deep state.

oH6fNzKRp8o,"SID:[TO AUDIENCE] NOW THE SUPERNATURAL INFORMATION  THAT THE GOD HAS PUT INTO PAUL MCGUIRE I WANT YOU TO  LEARN SOME OF THAT.  YOU READY?  YA' OPEN ?  AUDIENCE:YES!  PAUL:PRAISE THE LORD.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE.  SO I'LL JUST SHARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE  LORD HAS PUT ON MY HEART.  NUMBER 1, IS IN THE SHORTNESS OF THE SHOW IT'S  HARD TO GET INTO ALL THE INTENSITY.  I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M THE TYPE OF GUY,  I WILL RESEARCH-I WORK 12 HOURS A DAY- I'M  CONSTANTLY RESEARCHING THOUSANDS OF PAGES BECAUSE  EVERYTHING I TEACH ON PROPHECY,  EVERYTHING, I AM ALWAYS A SKEPTIC.  I DON'T BELIEVE IT, AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT,  IT SOUNDS TOO FAR-FETCHED.  SO WHEN I DELVE INTO THE SUBJECT,  AND I SEE THE FIRST-HAND SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,  ETC., ETC. THEN I REALIZE IT'S TRUE AND THEN I CAN  SPEAK ABOUT IT PASSIONATELY,  DESPITE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE THINK LIKE I'M FROM  OUTER SPACE.  I KNOW IT'S TRUE 'CAUSE I DID MY HOMEWORK.  AND EVERY TIME I GET CHALLENGED IN THE DEBATE,  AND I MEAN THIS RESPECTFULLY,  USUALLY THE PERSON DEBATING WITH ME AND  ATTACKING ME FOR SAYING WHAT I'VE SAID HAS  INVESTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF TIME ON THE RESEARCH,  INEVITABLY, BECAUSE I'LL ASK 'EM.  BUT THE LORD HAS TAUGHT ME TO BE COMPASSIONATE,  BECAUSE I USED TO BE THAT WAY TOO.  YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THIS STUFF,  LET'S BE HONEST, IT SOUNDS LIKE A SCI-FI MOVIE.  OKAY?  SO IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY TOWARDS WHAT I SAID,  YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND, OKAY?  I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.  I USED TO BE THE SAME WAY.  SO HERE'S THE DEAL.  THERE ARE THINGS GOING ON IN OUR WORLD,  THAT REALLY THEY'RE IN A LOT OF THE SCIENCE FICTION  MOVIES, BUT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND,  [IS] THEY'RE TRUE.  WE ARE LIVING IN THE WORLD OF THE FUTURE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOU ALL ARE,  I CAN KIND OF GUESS SOME OF YOU,  OTHERS I HAVE NO IDEA.  BUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS A KID,  CELL PHONE?  WITH THE TV THING IN IT.  MAN, PERSONAL COMPUTER?  WHEN I STARTED WRITING BOOKS I USED THE REGULAR  TYPEWRITER, AND THEN I MADE THE BIG TRANSITION TO  SOME REALLY CHEAP WORD PROCESSOR.  AND THEN I REMEMBER IN THE EARLY [DAYS],  I'VE WRITTEN 22 BOOKS, I REMEMBER IN THE EARLY DAYS  WHITE-OUT WAS FINALLY INVENTED.  AUDIENCE:[APPLAUSE] PAUL: MAN,  THAT SAVED MY LIFE 'CAUSE I COULD GO TO THE XEROX  MACHINE AND IF YOU DID IT REALLY GOOD IT LOOKS LIKE  AN ORIGINAL.  AND REMEMBER THE TYPEWRITERS THAT USED TO  AUTO ERASE?  AUDIENCE:YEAH!  PAUL:OKAY.  WELL, NOW WE HAVE WORD PROCESSORS.  THAT'S HUGE.  AND BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET I USED TO HAVE TO  GO THE LIBRARY AND POUR THROUGH BOOKS AND GO TO 20  LIBRARIES TO FIND FACTS.  NOW YOU CAN GOOGLE SEARCH AND IF YOU KNOW HOW TO  DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE LUNATIC WEB SITES FROM  AREA 51 AND THE REGULAR ONES YOU CAN FIND  INTERESTING INFORMATION.  OKAY.  SO BECAUSE OF THIS RESEARCH I BELIEVE THAT WE  ARE IN THE TIME IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE  RETURN OF THE LORD.  AND PEOPLE ASK ME, 'WHY?' I CAN GIVE YOU ALL KINDS  OF DOCUMENTATION.  YOU GOT A TASTE OF IT TONIGHT.  I DON'T SET DATES, EVER!  THE LORD COULD SURPRISE ME.  I'M PUTTING MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE AND  EVERYTHING ELSE THROUGH A LOT OF LOANS-AND YOU KNOW  I'M PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.  BUT THE CLOSENESS TO THE LORD'S RETURN,  ALL THE PROPHETIC SIGNS ARE HERE.  OKAY?  NOW- BUT AMERICA...  I BEGAN TO TEACH ALL THIS STUFF,  BECAUSE I'M AN EXPERT, UNFORTUNATELY,  IN MIND CONTROL AND IN MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE  JUST KIND OF FIELDS-IT'S LIKE OPENING PANDORA'S  BOX- YOU JUST WISH YOU HADN'T GOTTEN THERE,  BUT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW AND YOU'VE GOT TO  DEAL WITH IT.  AND I RESEARCH A LOT OF VERY INTENSE FIELDS SUCH  AS THE OCCULT AND THE LUCIFERIAN ELITE THAT  REALLY EXIST AND REALLY DO RUN THIS PLANET.  THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE.  SEE, THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE ARE IN A SPIRITUAL WAR.  APOSTLE PAUL [SAYS]: FOR OUR FIGHT IS NOT AGAINST  FLESH AND BLOOD BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES AND  POWERS AND THE DARK UNSEEN FORCES OF WICKEDNESS IN  HEAVENLY PLACES.  [EPHESIANS 6:12] CHRISTIANS FOR THE MOST  PART GIVE LIP SERVICE TO THAT BUT THEY DON'T REALLY  TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.  SO THE REALITY IS LUCIFER IS COMMUNICATING,  HIS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IS LIKE A  PYRAMID THAT GOES BACK TO PHARAOH-AND THE SLAVES ARE  AT THE BOTTOM AND, BY THE WAY,  ON THE BACK OF YOUR DOLLAR BILL YOU SEE THE OCCULT  PYRAMID.  AND PROBABLY MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT EYE  BALL IN THE PYRAMID ON THE BACK OF YOUR DOLLAR BILL?  THAT'S THE ALL-SEEING EYE OF LUCIFER.  OKAY?  THAT'S SATAN'S EYE BALL.  NOW ASK YOURSELF A QUESTION: 'WHAT IS SATAN'S  EYE BALL DOING ON THE BACK OF THE DOLLAR BILL?' IN  CASE YOU'RE CONFUSED AS TO WHY-AND BY THE WAY THAT'S  NOT MY OPINION.  THAT IS THE OPINION OF SCHOLARS,  IT'S NOT A DEBATABLE THING THAT I SAID IT.  YOU CAN'T DEBATE THAT, OKAY?  YOU CAN TRY, BUT DO SOME HOMEWORK AND THE DEBATE'S  ENDED.  OKAY.  SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID ARE THE WORDS IN  LATIN: NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM NEW ORDER OF THE AGES  WHICH MEANS 'NEW WORLD ORDER.' SO WE SEE ON THE  BACK OF THE DOLLAR BILL AN OCCULT PYRAMID WITH THE  WORDS [THAT TRANSLATE AS] NEW WORLD ORDER.  [AND] THAT'S WHERE AMERICA [COMES IN]-SIR FRANCIS  BACON IN THE MID-1600'S PLANNED FOR AMERICA TO BE  THE NEW ATLANTIS AND THE HEAD OF THE NEW WORLD  ORDER.  HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE ROSICRUCIANS WHICH BECAME  THE ILLUMINATI, AN OCCULT SECRET SOCIETY WHICH GOES  BACK TO ANCIENT BABYLON.  ALL RIGHT?  NOW THE ILLUMINATI -THEY'RE STILL IN  EXISTENCE TODAY, A VERY POWERFUL OCCULT  ORGANIZATION THAT RUNS THE WORLD- REMEMBER THE  ILLUMINATI FINANCED THE COMMUNISTS AND THEY  FINANCED HITLER.  OKAY?  THEY ALSO BACKED THE KKK [KU KLUX KLAN].  WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE KKK?  THE KKK IS THIS MASTER RACE STUFF.  OKAY?  SO, THE GOAL IS TO GO INTO A NEW WORLD ORDER,  WHICH IS ALL IN THE BIBLE.  NOW THE PHOENIX, WHICH I FOR MOST OF MY LIFE  THOUGHT WAS AN EAGLE-AND THERE'S MANY OTHER OCCULT  SYMBOLS ALL OVER THE DOLLAR.  OKAY?  THE GOAL IS TO GO INTO A GLOBAL CURRENCY-.WELL  LOOK, NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND WERE  [WE] NOW IN A PLACE WHERE THE GLOBAL CURRENCY IS  WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE.  THE TARGET DATE IS 2018.  THEY'VE MADE SIMILAR ANNOUNCEMENTS,  THEY MAY NOT HIT THAT DATE,  BUT THAT'S THEIR TARGET DATE.  AND THE TARGET NAME FOR THE GLOBAL CURRENCY IS  'THE PHOENIX' BASED ON THAT OCCULT BIRD.  AMERICA IS MOVING VERY QUICKLY INTO THIS NEW  WORLD ORDER.  OKAY?  THAT'S WHY WE SEE ALL OF THE TRANSFORMATION GOING  [ON.] EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING FOR THE MOST  PART IS NOT ACCIDENTAL, IT'S STRATEGIC.  ALL THE THINGS THAT APPEAR TO BE RANDOM ARE NOT  RANDOM THEY'RE PART OF A PLAN.  AND I'M JUST GONNA GET DOWN TO IT REALLY BLUNTLY.  THE MOTTO OF THE ILLUMINATI,  AN OCCULT ORGANIZATION, WAS 'ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.'  SO THE ILLUMINATI- THEY'RE OCCULT- DELIBERATELY  CREATES CHAOS SO THEY CAN BRING IN THEIR NEW WORLD  ORDER.  THAT'S THEIR OPERATING GAME PLAN.  THAT'S WHY THEY FINANCE THE RUSSIANS AND THE  NAZIS.  NUMBER 2, THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO,  THAT-PROMISES THE WORKER'S PARADISE,  [THAT] WE'LL REDISTRIBUTE THE WEALTH.  YOU KNOW ALL OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL ARE BEING TAUGHT  THAT.  YOU GO TO MOSCOW, MOSCOW'S GOT MORE BILLIONAIRES THAT  ANY OTHER CITY IN THE WORLD.  DO YOU SEE THE WEALTH EQUALLY SHARED IN MOSCOW?  I DON'T.  DO YOU SEE THAT WEALTH EQUALLY SHARED IN CUBA?  DO YOU SEE THE WEALTH EQUALLY SHARED IN CHINA?  EVERYWHERE A COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP HAS BEEN  INSTALLED THERE'S NO WORKER'S PARADISE,  THE WORKERS ARE WORSE OFF THAN THEY EVER WERE.  OKAY?  [IT'S A] LIE.  BUT GUESS WHAT?  THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO IS A TOTAL MIRROR COPY OF THE  ILLUMINATI OCCULT MANIFESTO THAT WAS  PUBLISHED A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER.  SO THAT TELLS YOU THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN  COMMUNISM AND THE ILLUMINATI.  AND BY THE WAY KARL MARX THE AUTHOR OF THE  COMMUNIST MANIFESTO WAS A PRACTICING SATANIST.  THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY  DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.  HE WAS A PRACTICING SATANIST AND HE HATED  CHRIST.  NOW, HITLER WAS ALSO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE  OCCULT.  SO, IN AMERICA, SEE, IF WE DON'T KNOW HISTORY-YOU  KNOW THE OLD EXPRESSION-'YOU'RE DOOMED  TO REPEAT IT.' AMERICANS DON'T KNOW HISTORY.  MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW HISTORY A WHOLE LOT MORE  THAN THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS.  WHY DID THE GERMAN EVANGELICAL CHURCH LEGALLY  VOTE FOR HITLER AS THEIR HEAD?  HE WAS VOTED INTO OFFICE.  WHY DID THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH OVERWHELMINGLY  SUPPORT HITLER?  AND THE QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED: 'IF THEY HAD THE  HOLY SPIRIT INSIDE THEM AND IF THEY HAD AN OUNCE  OF SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT IN THEM AND THEY PAID  ATTENTION AT ALL'-IT WAS QUITE OUT IN THE OPEN-THAT  THE THIRD REICH, BY THE WAY,  WAS NOT A POLITICAL PARTY FIRST,  IT WAS AN OCCULT PARTY FIRST.  EVERYBODY IN GERMANY KNEW THAT.  ALL THE SECRET OCCULT SOCIETIES WERE OPENLY  PUTTING HITLER INTO POWER 'SO HOW COME [IN] THE  EVANGELICAL CHURCH NOBODY HAD A DISCERNMENT FROM THE  HOLY SPIRIT THAT THIS MAN [HITLER] WAS  DEMON-POSSESSED?' IF SOMEBODY WALKED INTO THIS  ROOM DEMON-POSSESSED AND PRETENDED TO BE A LEADER,  ALL OF YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT INSIDE,  YOU WOULD HAVE THAT UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING,  RIGHT?  BUT THEY WELCOMED HITLER AS THE MESSIAH!  WHY WAS THAT?  WHY WAS THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH SO HYPNOTIZED?  THE-CHURCH IN AMERICA TODAY IS IN THE EXACT SAME  PLACE SPIRITUALLY AS THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH WAS IN  NAZI GERMANY.  THAT'S A SERIOUS WARNING.  BECAUSE IT GOES IN STEPS.  FIRST YOU DEMONIZE CHRISTIANS.  WE'RE ON THE TOP OF THE LIST.  YOU CAN GO AND GOOGLE AND SEARCH IT.  THERE'S AN AIR FORCE REPORT THAT CAME OUT THE  OTHER DAY.  EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS ARE NUMBER 1 ON THE LIST OF  RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS [AS] POSSIBLE TERRORISTS.  WE'RE ABOVE THE KKK, WE'RE ABOVE AL QAEDA,  WE'RE ABOVE THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?  OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?  IN A TIME OF CRISIS THEY COME AFTER US FIRST.  AND YOU ALL KNOW WHAT [HAPPENED] IN NAZI  GERMANY, WHERE IT LED TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND SO  ON AND SO FORTH.  NOW, [AS] ALL THESE PROPHETIC SIGNS HAPPENING,  ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE PARALYZED IN FEAR AND DO  NOTHING?  NO, THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS US TO BELIEVE.  SO I SHARED THE VISION I HAD OF A GREAT AWAKENING  IN AMERICA.  NOW PEOPLE THINK, 'WELL THAT INTERFERES WITH BIBLE  PROPHECY.' IT'S AMAZING HOW PEOPLE THINK  EVERYTHING GOOD INTERFERES WITH BIBLE PROPHECY.  OKAY?  NO, BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE IN BIBLE PROPHECY  WHICH SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE A GREAT-IT'S AMAZING THE  LACK OF LOGIC AND COMMON SENSE PEOPLE USE IN THEIR  ARGUMENTS-THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BIBLE AND IN BIBLE  PROPHECY WHICH SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE A REVIVAL AND  YOU CAN'T HAVE A GREAT AWAKENING IN THE LAST  DAYS.  AND THE ARGUMENT IS, 'WELL IT WILL BE A COUNTERFEIT  REVIVAL, IT WILL BE THE GREAT APOSTASY.' YES,  THERE IS A GREAT APOSTASY, IT'S GOING ON NOW.  I COULD NAME CHURCHES AND MOVEMENTS THAT ARE IN  APOSTASY.  AND THERE IS A COUNTERFEIT REVIVAL AND IT'S GOING ON  NOW.  BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE.  BUT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A COUNTERFEIT REVIVAL  DOESN'T MEAN THERE CAN'T BE A BIBLICAL REVIVAL  GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME.  AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] PAUL:AND HERE'S THE PROOF  WHY.  THE APOSTLE PAUL SAID THE LAST DAYS BEGAN WHEN THE  APOSTLE PAUL WAS TEACHING.  SO, WE HAD 'THE REFORMATION,' A MASSIVE  GLOBAL REVIVAL DURING THE LAST DAYS.  WE HAD THE 'FIRST GREAT AWAKENING' WHICH ROCKED  THE AMERICAN COLONIES.  WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE FREEDOMS OF AMERICA TODAY  IN OUR BILL OF RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTION,  AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE BILL OF  RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO  THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY YOU ARE A  TERRORIST.  THAT'S A FACT!  READ THE DOCUMENT ON THE REPORT OF RIGHT WING  EXTREMISM.  O.K.  SO, THERE WAS A '[SECOND] GREAT AWAKENING' AND IT  CHANGED OUR NATION AND IT GAVE US THESE RADICAL  FREEDOMS THAT NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS.  LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS AND  STUFF LIKE THAT-FREEDOM OF SPEECH,  FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THAT CAME FROM THE CHRISTIAN  INPUT, IT CAME FROM THE REVIVAL OF THE 'FIRST  GREAT AWAKENING.' THAT WAS IN THE LAST DAYS.  THE 'SECOND GREAT AWAKENING' WHICH PARTIALLY  FREED THE SLAVES WITH CHARLES FINNEY.  THAT WAS IN THE LAST DAYS.  THE HEALING REVIVALS IN 1940'S,1948.  THAT WAS IN THE LAST DAYS.  THE 'JESUS MOVEMENT,' HOW I GOT SAVED,  OR THE 'CHARISMATIC MOVEMENT.' THAT WAS IN THE  LAST DAYS.  SO I'VE GIVEN YOU NUMEROUS ILLUSTRATIONS OF POWERFUL  REVIVALS THAT HAVE ALL OCCURRED IN THE LAST DAYS.  SO WHY CAN NOT THERE BE ANOTHER REVIVAL IN THE  LAST DAYS BEFORE THE LORD RETURNS?  THERE CAN BE AND THERE WILL BE.  YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FULFILL THE GREAT HARVEST BEFORE  THE RETURN OF THE LORD IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER  OF THE LORD.  JESUS CHRIST SAID- PAUL: [READS]  PAUL:AND THEN YOU ASK ANYTHING IN HIS NAME.  THERE'LL BE MIRACLES, YOU'LL HAVE SUPERNATURAL  POWER IF YOU ABIDE IN THE VINE,  WHICH IS JESUS CHRIST, YOU WILL MOVE MIRACULOUSLY.  WE CANNOT FULFILL THE GREAT END TIME SOUL  HARVEST ON OUR OWN STRENGTH.  THAT SOUL HARVEST IS PRODUCED BY CHRISTIANS WHO  ARE FILLED WITH THE SUPERNATURAL POWER OF THE  HOLY SPIRIT AND REVIVAL.  SO THAT'S THE END OF THE ARGUMENT OF THE CRITICS.  OKAY?  [THE]ARGUMENT IS OVER.  NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL FOR YOU AND I: BECAUSE I LOVE  YOU, I TELL YOU THE TRUTH, OKAY?  AND SO-THERE'S A LOT OF PREACHERS THAT THEY MOCK  FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PREACHING-JESUS WAS A FIRE  AND BRIMSTONE PREACHER.  FOUNDER AND FATHER OF THE 'FIRST GREAT AWAKENING,'  JONATHAN EDWARDS, YOU READ HIS SERMON 'SINNERS IN THE  HANDS OF AN ANGRY GOD' 2 HOURS OF THE MOST GRAPHIC  DESCRIPTION OF HELL, AND THE TORMENTS OF HELL,  AND FIRE AND BRIMSTONE YOU'LL EVER READ IN YOUR  LIFE!  AND HE CHANGED THE NATION.  HE WAS A FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PREACHER!  NOW, ONE OTHER THING: AND THAT IS YOU HAVE AN  ASSIGNMENT.  THE ASSIGNMENT IS CALLED 'AMERICA.' DO NOT  PARTICIPATE IN THE LIE OF THE DEVIL.  THE FLAMING MISSILES OF THE EVIL ONE.  GOD IS NOT FINISHED WITH AMERICA YET.  AMERICA HAS NOT BECOME SO EVIL THAT GOD HAS TAKEN  HIS HAND COMPLETELY OFF OF AMERICA.  I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING THE  JUDGMENT OF GOD TO SOME DEGREE.  AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT GOD IS NOT ALLOWING US TO  BE CHASTISED NOR AM I SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT IN  THE GREATEST DANGER WE'VE EVER BEEN IN.  BUT I'M SAYING THE HAND OF GOD IS STILL ON OUR NATION  AT THIS MOMENT AND IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM GOD IS  GIVING US A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY TO RELEASE HIS  POWER IN THIS NATION.  BUT THAT RELEASE CAN'T HAPPEN IF YOU'RE GONNA  EMBRACE THE LIE THAT GOD IS FINISHED WITH AMERICA.  LISTEN!  GOD IS NOT FINISHED WITH AMERICA AND GOD IS NOT  FINISHED WITH YOU!  AND THAT IDEA THAT GOD IS FINISHED WITH AMERICA IS  JUST LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS POSSESSED BY A DEMON.  AS LONG AS YOU HOLD ONTO IT YOU'RE PARALYZED.

LlQX4fmRrpI,"as most of the news talks about  enforcing mandatory lock downs and  handing out money to citizens there has  been a problem that has been rapidly  expanding in the background of all of  this news and it is a problem that the  world has never really seen before in  fact it might create a crisis that won't  just be felt in the next week the next  month or even the next year but it might  be felt for several decades to come  during World War two Britain was in the  thick of war against the Axis powers  however Britain ran into a roadblock  they were quickly running out of money  so they began looking to borrow money  from both their own future taxpayers as  well as the United States and Canada in  1941 Britain began accepting loans and  taking on debt to fund the war and by  1945 Britain had taken on nearly ten  billion dollars worth of debt from its  creditors at this point in time  Britain's debt to GDP ratio was a  whopping 200 percent meaning that the  country had twice as much debt as its  entire market value of all of its goods  and services it produces over an entire  year and just some perspective for you  is that the World Bank states that once  a country reaches above 77 percent debt  to GDP ratio its economy will begin to  slow down from such a large portion of  its revenue going towards paying down  its own debt so after the war ended  Burton had amassed a debt that was so  large that they couldn't pay it back in  one year five years ten years or even 20  years you see on December 29th 2006  Britain made its last payment on its  World War two debt to the United States  and Canada  this means that British taxpayers from  1945 up until 2006 had a small portion  of their tax bill every single year go  towards the debt that the country  accumulated in the 1940s and for about a  decade after World War two  Britain's economy was drastically  hindered in part due to their  outstanding debt that they incurred  however their economy eventually  recovered thanks to an influx of tax  payers called the baby boomers as well  as some economic reforms and in  for structure investments but you see  Britney was a little bit lucky most of  the time when a country accrues as much  debt as Britain did during World War two  they are not so lucky  in 2001 Argentina's debt to GDP ratio  reached a high of a hundred and sixty  six percent which caused the country to  default on over 100 billion dollars  worth of debt this default made capital  move out of the country and soon the  nation saw millions of people enter  poverty while unemployment reached a  high of 19 percent and to this day  Argentina still hasn't fully recovered  from its debt crisis that it went  through nearly 20 years ago in similar  stories can be heard around the globe  there was Greece in 2012 Zimbabwe in  2006 Venezuela in 2017 and Russia in  1998 the point I'm trying to make here  is that even though debt can be a good  thing to take on in order to solve  today's serious problems it will almost  always have serious long-term  consequences that could last for years  or even decades so now let's bring this  back to the United States whether you  know it or not America essentially runs  on debt historically America's economy  has been so big and has grown so fast  that taking out tens of billions of  dollars here or there hasn't really been  much of a big deal because it was such a  small percentage of the country's  overall economy for example in 2006 the  United States had a relatively healthy  debt to GDP ratio of about 60 percent  but then the financial crisis hit and  during the financial crisis the United  States began scrambling for ways to pump  money into the economy so it began  taking at hundreds of billions of  dollars in eventually trillions of  dollars worth of debt and some people  might think that the United States along  with every other country that took out  debt to get through the financial crisis  has paid off some of the debt that they  accrued in 2008 and 2009 but actually  the opposite is true you see since the  financial crisis many developed  countries throughout the world have been  accruing more and more debt every single  year while economic growth has slowed  this means that many countries may find  it actually more  difficult to pay off their debt today  than they did during the financial  crisis and here's what I mean the United  States debt to GDP ratio before the lock  downs and this pandemic was around a  hundred and six percent Canada's was  around eighty eight percent Italy's was  a hundred and thirty three percent  Singapore's was at a hundred nine  percent and Japan's was at an astounding  237 percent what I'm trying to say here  is that before this crisis even hit the  governments around the world were in  more debt than they had ever been in and  then of course the lockdowns happened  and everything began accelerating have  you ever wondered how all of these  checks that citizens are getting today  are being paid for it's not from the  governments bank account because most  governments don't have a lot of money  right now and have little to no tax  revenue coming in for the foreseeable  future all of this is coming from debt  so yes all of the aid packages and  stimulus packages that every country in  the world is giving out is essentially a  form of debt that its taxpaying citizens  will have to pay over the next several  decades in fact if you live in the  United States right now roughly one out  of every ten tax dollars that you send  to the federal government goes directly  towards the interest payment on the  national debt and not towards any  government programs and after this  crisis passes that number will only get  higher so this brings up a scary  scenario many countries like the United  States will accrue so much debt during  these few months that they will be  unable to pay for some of their  government funded programs in the future  so things like Social Security which is  already running low on funds education  military health care one or all of those  things might be seeing major cuts in the  future in order to pay for the stimulus  packages today and if a government wants  to keep all of these social programs at  their current level without accumulating  more debt in the near future  it will have to do something that isn't  popular with its citizens which is raise  taxes now I would just like to mention  that it is highly unlikely that  developed countries like the United  States Canada or the UK will default on  its loans which would send the countries  into an even deeper depression but it is  quite  that the debt that's being accumulated  today will end up slowing future  economic growth raising future taxes and  reducing future funding for social  programs and this effect might radiate  for decades to come  meaning that kids born today in 2020  will likely be paying for a decent  portion of the stimulus packages when  they become adults and the government  debt is not the only debt problem that  we have in the world right now see  before the crisis ever began households  were already racking up a record levels  of debt to in 2020 households in the  United States had roughly 14 trillion  dollars worth of debt which is the  highest debt level in history and the  largest increase in household debt from  2008 to 2020 has come from of course  student loans in 2008 student loans  accounted for roughly 611 a billion  dollars worth of household debt  meanwhile today it is roughly 1.6  trillion dollars worth of household debt  and when you throw this all together you  will see that the average household has  roughly $100,000 worth of debt meanwhile  these same households have on average  only $8,000 worth of savings and for  people under the age of 30 it's even  worse as they have on average just two  thousand seven hundred dollars worth of  savings that is just enough to cover one  month of housing food and insurance for  the average person so what this all  means is that going into this crisis the  average person was already living  paycheck to paycheck with little to no  savings and tons of debt and this was  especially true for younger people it  also means that the 1200 dollar stimulus  checks might be able to help some  Americans get by for an extra week or  two but it won't be good enough for a  long-term solution the only way to help  people avoid missing rent payments  defaulting on their loans or being  delinquent on their mortgages is to lift  at the lockdowns across the world but  that might not happen for a while and I  can't help but think that as more and  more households become unemployed that  both individual and national debt will  begin to pile up in order to stay afloat  and this will happen at record levels  that we have never seen before and that  being said we have already surpassed the  2008 financial crisis in terms of  employment levels and it looks like we  might be heading for an economic dip  that we have not seen since the Great  Depression and depending on what other  policies are enacted in the near future  we as taxpayers will likely be paying  off as one two three month period of  time for the next several decades to  come  but this problem might be a lot worse in  the short term for developing countries  in fact the IMF and World Bank have  called for an immediate suspension of  debt payments for the world's developing  countries as many are very close to  defaulting on their debt this could  create an unprecedented debt crisis in  the near future that would likely  radiate throughout the entire world now  I would just like to mention that  central banks are playing a major role  in this debt crisis right now and are  printing money hand-over-fist which is  causing a ton of things like inflation  and currency devaluation but it also  might help pay down the debt in the  future through something called  quantitative easing but that could be a  whole video in itself so who knows this  might be the worst debt crisis the world  has ever seen but maybe not only time

to blow up the  Twin Towers to get your bill passed you  know oh well let's blow up the Twin  Towers innocent people don't matter  Charles Worcester who works for the  Environmental Defense Fund said people  are the cause of all the problems we  have to get we have too many of them we  need to get rid of some of them of  course he's not in the ones that need to  go and they were talking about banning  DDT which was had some problems of  course but was very effective at what it  did in the old days used to soak lumber  and creosote anybody remember the old  time remember to creosote ok so did pull  man and he used to put what's the stuff  used to put around your house to get the  termites out that they banned I worked  really well for termites and anything  that works good has been taken off the  market you know now you got of stuff  that brings it in what term adores what  we use now you know it brings them in  they eat it and go back to the hive and  or whatever the tribe colony and kill oh  but here they were talking about banning  DDT and Worcester said well if we ban  DDT it will help eliminate lower the  population of people interesting Bill  Clinton spelled with a k intentionally  there because of his communist leanings  bill clinton signed the biodiversity  treaty 1993 which says we must either  reduce Earth's human population to a  billion or reduce the standard of living  to an agrarian peasant status what are  they trying to do there are six billion  people on the planet they would like to  reduce the population to a billion or  make everybody a peasant because a  farmer you know he doesn't have much  impact on the ecology like a person  driving a car you know watching actually  hot water in their house you know and  actually building a road the United  States was divided up years ago to  protect the biodiversity you know to  protect the animals and these this map  shows the proposed biodiversity  impact the red areas are for animals  only no humans allowed period the yellow  areas are for buffer zones to protect  the animals you can go in the yellow  area if you have a special pass green  areas are for humans it goes back to the  animal rights you know mentality animals  have rights I agree it tastes really  good on a hamburger you know you can but  that's the plan anyway to reduce the  population close to you know to half  billion peter singer princeton  university professor who i'd love to  debate I don't even stole a lie how I  guess he said Christianity is our foe if  animal rights is to succeed we must  destroy this judeo-christian religious  tradition Peter Singer by the way is  trying to pass legislation this allows  abortions after the baby's born you have  28 days to decide if you want to keep it  sounds like the Spartans you know in two  thousand years ago we going back to  Haven ism Peter Singer gets his way we  will a couple good websites about that  Peter singers philosophy Alan Greg said  he works for the Rockefeller Foundation  the world has cancer and the cancer is  man where do people get a dumb idea like  this the Bible says God created the  world from for up for it was his world  but he created for us gave us you know  dominion over the earth Prince Philip  who's the husband of Queen Elizabeth and  she's the one invented the microwave  goes like that think about it you'll get  it in about 20 minutes okay Prince  Philip said if I can be reincarnated I  would wish to return to Earth to kill  her as a killer virus to lower human  population levels you say man that's  terrible well especially when you  consider he's got a huge majority  holding an ADM Archer Daniels Midland  which is one of the largest food  distributors in the world suppose you  get a guy in charge of a company like  that that decides okay we're going to  quietly put everything into place and at  a given signal everybody dump something  into the food supply and we're going to  lower the population in less than  a week he's in a position to do it you  get a guy with a motive and a method  most courts are going to look at that as  well this is a dangerous situation here  yes sir sure oh the chicken and flew you  know killed everybody or whatever you  know the oven I'm sure they got a cover  story I mean that's obvious you gotta  have a cover story makes you stop it  wonder you know what's really causing  this you need to go to Bill sardi calm  if you want to see some of these new  flus everybody's worried about you know  all the foul the birds flying dying off  you know killing them off go to Bill  sardi calm and read his website about  that some of these viruses are  deliberately being injected to lower the  population there's a great book i read a  few months ago called seeds of deception  genetically engineered foods Monsanto  Corporation including right here in  Pensacola they still an operation here  in Pensacola Monsanto a big company for  years far as I know there and many other  companies we primarily Monsanto has  tried to corner the market on food  production with genetically modified  foods now they've been banned in Europe  but seventy percent of the foods eaten  by US consumers that are processed foods  okay contain genetically modified go to  Taco Bell you get their tortilla which  has corn which is genetically modified  what do they do well they take the gene  code and then modify here's what the  goal is to get the seed to already have  the pesticide built in to the gene code  so as it grows the animals won't eat it  so in Europe as they started doing this  genetically modified food people started  noticing the butterflies are dying off  the butterfly goes to suck the juice out  of the flower like he's done all of his  life and also he croaks and so to save  the butterflies they ban the genetically  modified food now the fact that it kills  people oh well you know here's the  article from this patient this book  seeds of dissolution we sell by the way  in our bookstore it's not a Christian  book but in may 2003 President Bush  proposed in  to end hunger in Africa using  genetically modified foods he also  blamed Europe's unfounded unscientific  fears of these foods for hindering  efforts to end hunger Bush was convinced  that GM food genetic modified held the  key to greater yields expanded US  exports and a better world his rhetoric  is not new it's been passed down from  president to president and delivered to  the American people through regular news  reports and in the industry  advertisements the message was part of a  master plan that has been crafted by  corporations determined to control the  world's food supply keep in mind love of  money root of all evil this was made  clear in a biotech industry conference  in 99 where representative from Arthur  Andersen comes consulting group explain  how his company had helped Monsanto  create that plan first to ask Monsanto  what their ideal future looked like in  15 to 20 years Monsanto executives  described a world with one hundred  percent of all commercial seeds  genetically modified and patented love  of money got to get a patent Anderson  then worked backward from that goal and  developed the strategy and tactics to  achieve it they presented Monsanto with  the steps and procedures needed to  obtain a place of industry dominance in  a world in which natural seeds were  virtually extinct now think about it for  centuries for all of human history the  farmer plants his corn harvests the  field saves back part of his corn for  seed for next year right that's normal  if you eat it all now what are you going  to plant next year so there have been  some companies whose full-time business  is creating what's called seed corn I  grew up in the middle of Illinois middle  a corn country seed corn is growing over  there so there are companies that all  they do is plant you know thousands of  acres of corn not to eat but for seed  for the next year's corn so the farmer  harvests his feel sells all his corn  goes and buys his seed for the next year  that way because when you get hybrid  corn or hybrid anything with the first  generation you get your you know  ultimate results after that it begins to  go downhill again  you crossbreed you know two special dogs  and you get the super dog but then after  that it goes reverse back toward a mutt  you know within a few generations so the  farmers have learned hey let's just buy  seed corn which is you know the first  generation is always bigger better you  know and we get more money basically  more bushels therefore all goes back to  love of money well not only is Monsanto  working to get seeds that only they",3

Debbie and I saw it  coming a month ago we went it was last  Thursday or Friday we went to Costco for  just some final things just to really  top things off toilet paper some medical  items some alcohol different things that  we could use you know that that if the  if the stores are bare if we have to  hunker down and sit up here for three  months six months or a year because of  what's some craziness going off in the  city that we're not going to be without  and even then I told mrs. W LA it was  Friday they were at Costco in Portland  some of the things were started there  started to be shortages the toilet paper  was running out now you've all heard the  stories and it's not I'm not doing this  to scare you guys but I'm telling you a  lot of people out there are gonna be  fearful and they're gonna start hoarding  they're gonna go out there and start  buying things so the thing to be afraid  of is the ignorance and the people that  are panic buying and it's going to cause  shortages you have a responsibility to  make sure you have the things in place  in your home to protect your family so  if it's canning do your canning if  you're going to the Mormon cannery  that's good if you're just stocking up  on canned food and doing things locally  where you can that's fine but do  something have the ability and have a  plan do you have a plan to get water if  the water mains are shut off you have a  plan for long term emergency food do you  have spare medications do you know how  to get antibiotics without a  prescription  you know these are things you guys needs  to look into you have that  responsibility to do it so  the reason why I put those videos up and  the reason why it was nothing more than  a public service announcement we have  we've made the link available to you  guys through my Patriot supply you can  order through our Channel and get a  discount if you can do it or not do it  it's not it's I'm not bending anyone's a  year and forcing anyone to do anything  I'm just making that available this is  what I did I'm sharing with it something  you might want to consider so again it's  not about fear I'm not fearful I don't  know I can't control any of those things  where who and why and all that but what  I can control is what happens at my  house I've got food for a year for my  family I've got water  I've got firewood I've got ability to  protect it and nobody is coming through  this front gate if I don't will it so  make sure that you have these plans in  order again not about fear so what so  what if you buy you stock up on some  groceries you buy some canned food you  buy some beans you buy some extra coffee  what's the worst thing that's gonna  happen are you not gonna use it  you basically just bought some things  you don't have to go to the store nearly  as often so please there's still time  left with my Patriots supply the example  be careful and know that there are huge  delays with that now they've always  guaranteed two-day deliveries when I  ordered mine it was two-day deliveries I  was speaking with him last week they  said their sales have went up one  hundredfold with the announcement of the  CDs the CDC announcement talking about  hey you know you might want to get some  flashlights you might want to get some  batteries you might want to have some  abilities you know it's going down when  Japan has closed all the schools in the  whole country you know something you  might want to stand up and take notice I  mean in my very own state in the Pacific  Northwest here we have cases we have  cases that are coming up from people  that were at a a town that one of the  people that it's at our homeschooling  group was actually attending not two  weeks ago so it's real it is happening  be prepared have some things in store  the way I would look at it is if I have  to wait it out for a month if I have to  stay in my home and eat off of out of my  pantry do am I prepared do I  the things that I need to do is so even  though there's a waiting list if you  don't have time or don't have the desire  or the know-how to put together your own  food plan go on there and get yourself  on the waiting list because if you wait  another day you're only gonna be further  down the line and maybe they'll start  shipping sooner I don't know but there's  no reason why a guy shouldn't have you  know for your family  some four-week kits some some 90 day  kits you know there's what whatever  makes them match to do what you want but  get something because this thing is real  and it could it could get worse before  it gets better so again it's not about  fear I'm not afraid of any of these  things but I am what I am afraid of is  the way people react when they're scared  that's the biggest concern and so may  God bless you and your families keep us  in your prayers and we'll see you guys  on the next video ",1
6TcOSbrvPlo,"What do you tell people to do with their  money how to be aware of money and how  is money used in a similar way as a  psychological tool  money doesn't really exist it's a theory  if you look at how the world's  been acquired it's been done  by a banking scam where you lend people  money that doesn't exist we call it  credit and you charge them interest on it  and if they don't pay the money back  plus interest then you get their wealth  that does exist you get their home their  business their land their resources  whatever and we've been through a  process of banks  lending credit, figures on a screen  greatly in excess of what  they have as assets called fractional  reserve lending and then when they can't  pay it back because often the banks  have taken actions that have  crashed the economy like in 2008 the  banks then get all the things they've  lent money on the real wealth of the  world and what's happened in this  process of lending credit  getting the real resources when they  can't pay back the credit has sucked the  wealth of the world the real  wealth of the world into the hands of  a very very few people and left out  there most of the rest of the population  with something called money and money  only buys anything because we take it  seriously you know if it's just a piece  of paper and this is the point it's  meant not even to be a piece of paper it's  meant to be purely electronic and so we  have this fresh air money that is worth  something because the buyer and the  seller believe in it and only because of that  and the real wealth of the world  has been sucked into the hands of a very  few people by lending this scam called  credit another interesting thing about  it this money situation is when you go  to a bank and you say borrow 50,000 pounds  they'll type into your account  50,000 pounds in credit  where does the credit come from here  but you're not paying back 50,000 pounds  you're paying back 50,000 pounds plus interest  the interest is never created only the  principal because people think that  governments create money  money is overwhelmingly created  by private banks  issuing credit that's that's how  so-called money comes into circulation  so what this means is  creating credit for the principal but  not the interest is that at no point is  there ever enough money credit or  otherwise in circulation to pay back all  the debt and all the interest on the  debt outstanding so people losing their  homes and their businesses and their  resources etc is built into the system  on purpose now when there's an expansion  of the money supply and expansion of  money in circulation peter paying Paul  that seems you know to hide it  to an extent but once you squeeze the  money supply you take money out of  circulation it becomes obvious that  there's nothing like enough money in  circulation to pay back all the debt so  these people losing their homes  their resources they're  things that they own for no other reason  that there simply is not enough money  for everyone to pay back the debt so  what do the banks do whoo we'll have that  and this has been going on for centuries  and they've hijacked the real wealth  of the world by doing this and the next  stage which is in my books from the  early 1990s is the cashless society you  know I was pointing out purely by  knowledge of what this agenda was  that they were going to get rid of cash  and look look at it cash is flying out  of circulation some places like Sweden  is all almost totally cashless they're  shutting down Bank branches so you  cannot interact with a bank branch  locally with cash you have to do it  online because that's the electronic  money and eventually they're gonna take  a cash our circulation why  because when you go into a store now or  anywhere and you  give them a credit card electronic  money and they say sorry  the system won't accept your card well  you can still pay cash but when there's  no cash in circulation your electronic  money which is meant to go through a  microchip eventually  when they say the system  won't accept your microchip  or your card you have no other means  of purchase so whoever controls  the system is dictating whether you can  purchase or whether you can't whether  you can eat or whether you can't and the  only other alternative to that would be  barter and I'll tell you what the plan  is the plan is to ban barter to make it  illegal on the basis that they can't tax it  so that's along the line as well  How does cryptocurrency play into this?  I'm not saying that  there couldn't be good things  with things like Bitcoin  and stuff like that as long as cash  stays in circulation that's the key  while cash is in circulation you have  other points or ways of purchase  once there's no cash and you have only  cashless digital currencies then whoever  controls them controls everything  and not only that they  can wipe your bank account  if you're a dissident to the  system as this moves on into more  extremes they can wipe your bank account  and it's just gone because all  it is is figures on the screen you can  wipe figures on a screen in a second you  can from a central point crash the  entire economy  by controlling digital money and digital  processes and the idea eventually  the problem, reaction, solution create the  problem and then offer the solution is  to have a gigantic crash which they will  instigate and then to overcome the crash  they will propose a totally new economic  system of central control to be the  solution to the problem they've created  which is crashing the economy and the  more control they have over money  digitally electrically the easier it is to do that ",2

Xu Jiang Gao  another professor at the University of  Pittsburgh's microbiology Department  says that 2019 and CoV and the snake  speak a similar language genetically so  it is not unfeasible that snake may be  the source bats were not expressly  present in Hua nan market but  authorities believe that there were live  snakes on sale for human consumption  it's useful to note that SARS was also a  corona virus that left from bats to  humans though that indicates that bats  are harbors of disease  not that 2019 ncod will be as deadly as  SARS in fact when we compare wuhan  pneumonia to other major diseases in the  last 50 years the percentage of those  who died from it is quite limited at  least for now  for example SARS infected approximately  8,000 people and killed around 800 of  them mer is infected around 2500 and  also killed around 800 that's a fatality  rate of 10 percent and 35 percent  respectively whereas wuhan pneumonia has  infected around 28,000 people and killed  560 as of February 6 a fatality rate of  about 2% an illness like Ebola on the  other hand has infected thirty five  thousand five hundred people in total  killing 13,500 the fatality rate of 40  percent keep in mind though that  statistics on SARS MERS Ebola and wuhan  pneumonia aren't exactly comparable  Ebola has been in circulation since 1976  SARS since 2002 and MERS since 2012 so  we're looking at data taken over a range  of time periods of course Ebola has  killed more people but it's had 44 years  to rack up its death count wuhan  pneumonia was only discovered in  December 2019  so the death count and the total  infected has only one direction to go up  but don't get too worried the youngest  victim of this infection was 34 the  majority of fatalities were between the  ages of 60 and 85 and they also had  previous comorbidities aka  pre-existing illnesses if you're a  person with a compromised immune system  you're probably keeping an eye out for  any and all illnesses and this one is  likely just as dangerous as all the  others but for essentially healthy  persons you'll likely just shake it off  after a couple weeks in quarantine  considering all this the w8 show as of  January 30th chose to declare a public  health emergency of international  concern or Phe I see saying that it is  still possible to interrupt virus spread  provided that countries put in place  strong measures to detect disease early  isolate and treat cases trace contacts  and promote social distancing measures  commensurate with the risk they say that  a Phe IC should be seen in the spirit of  support and appreciation for China its  people and the actions China has taken  on the front lines of this outbreak  which includes the construction of a new  hospital built over the course of ten  days in quarantine involving over a  dozen cities impacting around 46 million  people to put that in perspective that's  more than the entire population of  Canada at 37 million and the largest  quarantine in human history it may seem  like this situation is concerning but it  is by no means catastrophic if you're  concerned for your health and the health  of people around you there are things we  can do both the Government of Canada and  the American CDC say that regular  washing of hands under hot water for at  least 20 seconds is the best way to keep  yourself safe  they also recommend avoiding sick  individuals and refraining from touching  your eyes mouth and nose before you have  washed your hands basically the same way  you protect yourself from the flu which  I might add has already infected 15  million people and killed 8,000 people  since October 2019 in the United States  alone at the end of the day there isn't  much to worry about yet 2019 and CoV is  dangerous not because it's more deadly  than SARS or MERS  that it has the ability to be we know  some things about this virus we know  it's a corona virus we know it's killed  people that we're old or infirm and we  know that it's spreading faster than  expected but as with most things it's  what we don't know that scares us the  most the best way for us as individuals  to proceed as of now early February is  to keep washing our hands thoroughly  keep ourselves away from sick people and  to seclude ourselves if we're  experiencing symptoms of the illness hmm  tastes like a fun way to copy  [Music]  [Music] ",1
1w8yHeF4KRk,"Ready. Ready. Let's go. Hi it's totally Tod's workshop and Tod Cutler here and  today we're going to do one of those burning questions people have been  asking about for ages. A speed trial between a proper longbow, we've got Joe  Gibbs here, war bow archer and war bow bowyer. He can shoot an  extraordinary 200 pounds, today he's just doing 160. I'm on a windlass crossbow, 860  pounds in draw weight and we'll just have a look at the difference in speed  between shooting. We will start our time trial as if with two bodies of archers  ready to start shooting each other, so I will span my bow and have that ready.  Doesn't take Joe long to get ready. And here we go  Ready? Ready. That's good  Yeah well there's a thing eh? Lets go and fetch them. And you got another one straight  in the centre. Quite clearly the longbow, Joes' longbow out shot me massively  so I didn't even manage to get a second bolt off. So the obvious thing is on the  surface the crossbow is a completely useless weapon compared to the longbow.  But a windless crossbow similar to this either this or a sinew prod or a yew  prod. They were used for hundreds of years, at least 200 years, so what's going  on? I mean what were your observations of that Joe? Took you a obviously  quite a while to to span it, you know after a bit of training that you know, I  could do it quite happily whereas the longbow takes a fair few years to build  up the strength and technique and just to be accurate with a longbow takes a  long time. You were accurate - depressingly so. I think  that's very true, I mean I haven't even bothered drawing your bow, I haven't even picked it up, I mean theres no  point whereas I have given you the windlass bow to show you and you can  shoot it quite confidently which is very that's very interesting in its own right.  Because I mean you know sort of the bands of crossbow archers were very  well paid. I think  better paid than longbow archers, so it's  there's a big mystery there because if it's so easy to  use really what's going on? I mean one of the things is your bow is  essentially a cheap item and that is essentially an expensive item; it's the same in industry now, if you've got expensive equipment you charge a lot for  the time even if the job is very easy. I suppose those guys were pretty  proficient soldiers as well you know they're well kitted out in armor as  well. I think what's very frustrating for me with this that you don't have, you can  just pick it up and shoot it, it just utterly painless in that sense, whereas I have  to be really careful to get ready for the next shot. Because I have to unwind my windlass fully. you have to let it down carefully on the ground so it  doesn't tangle up for the next shot and and still you get the ropes around the  trigger sometimes. I shoot it reasonably regularly but not  not again and again you know, I'm not drilling for it. I suppose that they  would have done that and they had people spanning them for them didn't they?  Yes that's a very good point. You would have got twice the amount of bolts  off. Yes I could, so you hand the windlass to somebody and while  you're shooting, they're getting it ready for the next, so yeah that was often done  behind a pavaise, mobile shield. But if I double my shots, you're still twice as  fast. I didn't even get two off and I was ready to go on the first one.  So yeah that is interesting but I suppose it comes down to the social  structure of England as well doesn't it? Because every every guy had to shoot a  bow and so every every guy can shoot, maybe not like you  can shoot, but they can shoot. Shoot a decent bow. And that  wasn't possible on the continent to field those armies, you need to have  specialist troops for that and they've the best you've got is a crossbow  because you can't field 2000 longbowmen, then it's a crossbow you use. So me tell me about  the training, I mean how long? how hard? how much? So basically I've been  shooting heavy type bows for 16/17 years, so I started when I was quite  young about sort of 14/15. I started. Started on the heavier bows?  Obviously not on first one, but quickly into it? 70 pounds plus  and then and slowly worked up from there made my own bows so it  wasn't too expensive for me to work up, could make my own kit so it's a cheap  way of doing it and I shoot two three times a week.  So maybe 100 arrows a week. And how often do you get the two hundred  out? Maybe only sort of every two weeks or something just otherwise I don't want  to knacker (damage) myself. You need a bit of time for your body to  recover because you know, it's a serious weight.  I didn't shoot two but I loaded two, I wouldn't want to do that for half an  hour, I mean I couldn't do that for half an hour. What I was doing there.  Now I know that they're going to be fitter and that's what they are geared up  for, but as you stand now, with 160 pound bow, shooting let's just say four  or five shafts in a minute, how long do you think you can keep that up?  Probably not that long I could get the sort of two sheaves off as for shooting  after that I think I'd probably be bit knackered for constant shooting. If I had  you know it's just a bit of a break you know just took my time about it maybe a  few more. But after the two sheaves, I'll probably be ready  to chuck my bow down and fight anyway I mean there's kind of with  battles like Agincourt or Crecy or whatever you know that the  engagement was several hours long, and so you've got some sort of vision of the  archers just for several hours just pumping them out. But just not possible  no? No I don't think I want to spray all my arrows out and one go anyway.  I probably take my time about it and choose my shots to be honest. It  takes a lot of control so it's not just pulling the action of pulling a bow, it's  when you release. Because your body's under a hell of a lot of  compression and when you let go that string your body wants to release it, so  you have to control that bow arm from stop it doing this or this. So  do you concentrate on your technique? It just comes  naturally; so your body does what it has to do to pull the bow and once you've  been doing it for so long you don't have to concentrate on pulling the bow or  anything it's all natural. Bang. Job done.  No sort of aiming, no gap aiming? No it's seamless, all instinctive, I'm  just looking at the target. Your arm those where it's got a go. That's shooting  three times a week isn't it? Yeah exactly  In medieval England it was a requirement from being quite small boy, for every man  in the land to learn how to shoot a bow. So if you take let's say a 14 year old  lad and you try to work him up to the war bows, how often do you have to  shoot and how long would it take to sort of do the thing safely because obviously  can injure yourself by over doing it. I would say to get him up to a  hundred pounds would probably take,  probably a year because you know if he's not done much before it will  take a quite a while from everything to start build and stuff. But  100 pounds should be pretty achievable; achievable for every one. 100 pounds.  You should be able to shoot 100 pounds no problem  and then the heavier you get, you just got to take that time really. I would  say within five years you should be able to be shooting a decent weight 150  pounds. So it's not necessarily the the strength that makes you a good  archer it's being able to hit stuff, you know if you can shoot 150 pound bow but  you spray your arrows everywhere what's the point?  you might as well shoot 100 pound bow and shoot and hit what you're shooting  at. But the other thing that I found very interesting was, as I said before,  I've been shooting for a long time, but not heavy bows and I've been very  interested in war bows and I thought well you know, I want to learn how to shoot.  There was a lady came into my shop one day carrying a bow and it was quite  obviously a significant bow and it turned out to be 80 pounds, but she was  like 5 foot 2 you know, small lady. And I asked her how she could draw that  because I thought no way I can pull that and she showed me how to do it.  Showed me sort of a different technique to the the modern target archery  that I'd been shooting before. That I found enormously interesting, so we then  went down the range and I shot it and I shot it by using a different technique  and I shot it relatively comfortably and that was an absolute eye-opener for me.  That the technique is different. It's a completely different technique so you  you want to be using a lot of your back muscles, so it's not you're not just  pulling it with your arms. You're not no you're not going to do it with just  your arms. So you need to engage all your back muscles in it and as much as  you can just to get that bow back really. Its technique and strength. A combination.  Yeah you need the combination to be able to do it. So in the last ten  years the people who shoot heavy bows the average has gone up. So  ten years ago you know if someone said I'm shooting 100 pounds everyone would go 'whoa 100 pounds'  but now it's the average has gone up to 125 130 pounds is  the norm. So I feel in another 10 years it would be higher but you know  medieval times it had been going on for hundreds of years.  Every village like this one, has got a butts you know there's always somewhere you can  go and shoot, hang out with your mates. Exactly. So when you're out shooting with your mates, you go  'have a go with my bow' and such and such, have a go with your one see if I can  pull it. Thats it, I suppose when you've got a whole culture built on the bow  you know, men like to boast, I don't suppose that's ever changed, and  you are gonna be having a go and trying to get yourself bigger and better than  bloke next door. Exactly so you know people always ask me if they can have a  go at my bow, you know some people pull it, you know I'm not saying I'm the only  one out there that does it, because I'm not. There are guys out there, that can shoot 160 pound  bows as well, not many but there's a few. You know and I've helped  them along their way, help them train up and such. So do you do any  training, any weight training, with a bow in mind, that doesn't involve  a bow? I don't have a physical job so I do a small amount of weights just at home  just to keep in shape, but there's nothing in a gym that represents a bow.  You can't you cannot theres nothing will help you pull a bow. If you want to shoot  a bow, shoot a bow, that's it, full stop. There's no point going down the gym  thinking if I can benchpress you know such and such, I will be able to. No. Rubbish, if you  want to shoot a bow get out there and shoot a bow. yeah that's it.  The bow is your gym. Exactly, you don't need anything else. I think there  were two very notable things actually about that trial that we've just done,  speed trial, was one of course is that you're out shooting me shot-for-shot  quite clearly, many times over. The other thing that is notable, is that your  arrows are going through the boss and sticking out the other side. The  bolts that I was shooting sometimes they come out the back sometimes they don't.  So just on that very easy thing there you can say that your bow is  more powerful than mine. Mine has got this fantastic headline number of 860  pounds yours is a rubbish 160  pounds you know your 700 pounds off. So what's going on? And that's you know, it's  just a really simple thing is that when you draw your bow you're accelerating  the arrow over what 25 26 inches. I've got roughly a six inch brace  height and then it's drawn back to 30. So about 24 inches. So you're getting  your energy into the arrow pushing it forward 24 inches. I'm pushing it for  six inches, six and a half inches, so a quarter of what you've got. So I've  got a massive headline number, but the efficiency of this is absolutely  appalling, but that's what's curious because it is true now, and it's true  back then. If the efficiency is so bad and actually this is delivering less  power than yours is, you know, why are they using it? I think there are  advantages because one thing to remember is this style of windlass bow it's  called an English windlass so the English were not just about long bows.  You know they use crossbows as well and these are great for sieges. If you're up  on the battlements there, or if I'm on battlements and you want to shoot me, you  have to step out of your cover, you have to.... Expose a lot of you. You have to  draw because you can't step out drawn. And that takes time where you've got a  few guys on the castle having a pop back at you. Whereas I can be from a hide  shooting through a hole that big. It's good for that sort of sniping type thing,  that that long-term warfare where the rate of shooting is not quite so  important. So that's where they're very useful in sieges and you see them quite  a lot in naval warfare as well. Crossbows with handy for that I think  probably again because if you imagine with all the rigging and the low  decks and everything else, a long bow is a difficult thing to use. It can be a  clumsy weapon in a confined space  you keep hitting the knocks and tips and every one thing, with a crossbow it's a  lot easier. I mean the thing is as well, I don't if you're the same as me,  but when I shoot a longbow, even if I've got a couple of twigs or something above  my head, your mind is not on what you're shooting, you're sort of like  you're halfway up there trying to... and it must be hell if you got rigging and  stuff like that around you. Yes almost impossible I'd say if I come up to draw  and even just the small this twig touches the top of the limb  you can feel it it, puts you off, if you loose it sounds stupid, but if you  loose and your limb hits the smallest twig, it upsets the shot.  You don't want it you don't want anything near you.  And on the surface they are far outclassed by the long bow, I mean you  can't deny that, but they are for different purposes really.  They're either because you can't field an army full of long bows because you  haven't got the guys to do it or otherwise this style of warfare be it  naval or siege actually can give the crossbow an advantage even though it  can't do the rate of shooting. Because again one of the comments I get often is  ""oh that's really slow that's really useless they'd never have used that"" and  it's like ""look in the pictures they did all this time for hundreds of years"" so  it was a very effective weapon, but if it was you and me in a field 100 yards  apart, I know where I put my money. So would I! Thanks. Joe and I also thought it'd be  interesting to have a look at the accuracy of the two weapons. What I would  say, Joe shoots three times a week and is a world-class archer. I shoot once twice  a month a few shots, so I'm not, but let's just have a look. As a relatively  competent crossbowman, against a very excellent longbowman, what we can both do  at 25 meters.  Now as you can see here this is my group right of centre, Joe's group left of  centre, but actually in terms of group size they're fairly comparable and on  the basis that Joe shoots two to three times a week and I shoot off a couple of  bolts every few weeks, really it just shows that a crossbow is an easier  weapon to aim and so if you're experienced in it you're quite clearly  gonna get better grouping than a longbow guy. I must say I was a bit worried you were going to  completely blow me out of the water, so i'm quite thankful that you didn't and as it  came out, the two groupings were, we both shot little off, but the two groupings were  about the same size. Yeah not far off well the crossbow is obviously you can  you can pick one up and train to use it quite quickly. Obviously it's got less  variables than the longbow you know a longbow is, you've got this arm, this arm,  and your loose. Length of draw. Thats why it takes so many  years to to be able to shoot accurately. It was a nice thing to see how the two  compared and I think it's clear that the crossbow is inherently a more accurate  weapon, because of the lower number of variables and a comparison that is often  made in the comments that I get, is that the crossbow is the sniper rifle of  medieval times. Actually I think there's probably some truth in that,  because you can lay in wait for your target. Yeah. And then when you do shoot,  you're inherently pretty accurate and so there's a good chance of you hitting  the target. So I think it's actually a fairly valid comparison, certainly for  siege warfare, that it is a bit like the sniper rifle. Yeah I would say so. Joe  thank you once again it's been great having you here. Thank you I enjoyed it  it was good. And hopefully we'll go again. Yeah  definitely. ",1

morning when she gets up  with her partner to tend to the 7,000  pigs on the family farm in northeast  England also every three weeks around a  thousand piglets are born on the farm in  an interview hurt been said winning the  lottery was amazing but the first time I  brought a piglet into the world I felt  like I'd hit the jackpot  we can only conclude this is not the  usual life of a millionaire number eight  Yancey Hicks the antsy Hicks from  Chicago was able to materialize his  dream after winning a million dollars in  2008 instead of quitting he kept working  at McDonald's where he was already  working for the last 26 years  he's always dreamt of having his own  franchise in the next four months he  researched for several restaurant  franchises and ultimately decided to

number seven  Emma Wilden Emma Wilden and her husband  Philip sketched out a highly  professional plan after winning a  million pounds in 2013 she wasn't  interested in getting fame for being a  millionaire until the news was broken  and the media approached being a  financial advisor her husband was a  great help in managing the money in  their account the family agreed to set  aside a hundred thousand to blow and the  other nine hundred thousand pounds were  used to invest in two rental properties  today the business is managed by Emma  herself giving her the confidence and  the

sheetmetal worker when he scooped a 7.5  million pound lotto jackpot following  the win he started doing what you'd  expect from a lottery winner he bought a  six-bedroom mansion three racehorses and  many other unnecessary things that  didn't bring him any profit then he  realized it would be better to start  investing his money Roy is set up his  own sheetmetal company and is invested  in 14 properties in England as well as a  luxury villa in Cyprus the property's  value is double since then Gibney also  thinks it's important to give back so he  has supported many charities whether  it's running charity fishing case or  dressing up as father Christmas for the  local hospital number 5 Mark Brunell  the winner of the lotto jackpot of nine  hundred thousand pounds in 1997 Mark  Brunell  owns a five-bedroom family home and  stockton-on-tees England when he won the  lottery he was a chemical tanker driver  and also the manager of a local bakery  together with his wife he's been running  a double glazing business for the last  13 years it was what they had invested  in for years after winning the lottery  in an interview mark said we used a  majority of our winnings to set up our  business however we also bought  ourselves a great home as well as some  lovely cars winning the lottery set us  up for life  and has given us options we would never  have had number four  Brad Duke Brad dude the winner of the  2005 how I ball dreamt of raising his  amount to 1 billion dollars within three  years what Duke won in 2005 had reduced  considerably  after taxes on his lucky day he said to  his father I bet you never thought we  would both retire on the same day but  actually Brad started striving harder  from that day he started several  projects with about 20 employees  including a personal assistant  accountants a publicist salespeople and  consultants Brad spent a major part of  his win in traditional investments and  on the other hand managed mountain bike  races and promotion Duke thinks that all  lottery winners should define what is  important to them and develop a smart  plan around it number 3  Peter Lavery Peter Lavery is the former  bus driver in the winner of ten million  pounds in 1996 in the National Lottery  he's one of those wise spenders who have  multiplied the amount they had in their  pocket despite that he paid a half a  million for expensive luxury cars Lavery  is wealth since claiming the prize has  increased three times today he owns 33  properties given out on rent across  Northern Ireland a number of housing  sites in development and his own whiskey  distillery and Peter also hires more  than 70 people around the UK number two  James Harvey and his colleagues in  January of 2005 MIT senior James Harvey  was planning to carry out independent  study when he found out about cash  windfalls loophole unlike traditional  lottery games cash windfalls biggest  prize did not exceed two million dollars  if the six number jackpot was not one  which occurred about 99 percent at the  time the two million dollar prize was  rolled down in the smaller prizes that  matched four or five numbers sometimes  increasing those prizes tenfold  Harvey determined that during a roll  down each lottery ticket was worth more  than it costs so Harvey and his dorm  mates placed $1,000 worth of bets that  soon became three thousand dollars the  group eventually determined that if they  purchased at least six hundred thousand  dollars worth of tickets during a roll  down they could garner an average profit  of more than 15% so they began  attracting investors and in 2010 they  won nearly the entire cash windfall  prize in a single drawing purchasing  seven hundred thousand $2 tickets and  cashing in eight hundred and sixty of  the nine hundred and sixty three winning  slips estimates say the group earned  about 3.5 million dollars over seven  years however in 2011 the lottery  restricted the number of  tickets any store could sell in a day  and the game was stopped in 2012 number  1 Joan Ginther as the people call her  the luckiest woman interest won the  lottery four times most people believe  that winning the lottery four times is  more than what could be called a  coincidence this 63 year old Texan went  five point four million dollars in 1993  then some ten years later she won two  million dollars then two years later  three million dollars and in the summer  of 2010 she was lucky enough to get a  ten million dollar jackpot the 20 point  four million dollars she won tops not  only cases involving seemingly normal  players it even exceeds examples  involving lottery cheaters who beat the  system through various illegal schemes  many experts doubt her luck and believe  that she a math teacher cracked the  algorithm and found out the lottery  winning secrets one of the explanations  is that she bought a huge number of  high-priced tickets and used the  strategy similar to the one used by the  MIT students you've just heard about  you ",1
n-O5mnscPQE,"hey what's up guys chat here with green  lights shooting and welcome to this new  video so today we were talking about  which Glock is right for you a lot of  people have narrowed down what handgun  they want to the fact that they want a  Glock but then there are so many  different Glocks I don't know what you  want to choose so that's where we're  here that's why we're here today before  we get into that I do want to mention I  am at TNT guns and range in Murray Utah  this range is absolutely off the charts  fantastic facility staff selection  everything here I can't speak highly  enough about thanks to them to making  this video possible give them some love  their website is that in the video  description below next thing I want to  mention is that I'm rocking that give  rise tactical t-shirt if you like this  look you like the style very slim fit  very long booth concealed carry make  sure to grab yourself one over NGLs  gear.com now let's get into the Glocks  so as I mentioned you you narrowed it  down you know you want a Glock you're  just not sure which Glock you want now  obviously you know you first of all you  want to figure out which caliber you're  looking at so generally speaking we'll  stick with that 9 40 or 45 there's also  380 if you know you want to be sort of  in that concealed carry really small  option for the sake of this video we're  gonna go with 9 I'm going to show you  all the different options in 9 and then  you can carry those across pretty much  to 40 and 45 depending on just which  size of gun you want you can find pretty  much all these sizes in each caliber but  9 is a fantastic option if you're  looking at something that's easy to  shoot at the range that you know will  help pack enough punch for concealed  carry you can have a good peace of mind  about it it'll also carry a lot of  rounds so you can hopefully get a lot on  target as well as you know you know home  defense whatever it is you want 9 is a  great kind of medium 40s gonna give you  a little bit more you know the rounds  are a little bit hotter a little bit  bigger bullet stuff like that and then a  45 you've got a real big round it's  moving a little bit slower a little bit  less capacity but it is a real big round  ok so anyways we're gonna stick with 9  millimeters here in front of me in terms  of size I've got from smallest to  biggest an we're gonna work our way up  through those so let's start with this  guy this is the Glock 43 this is the  smallest of the bunch of 9-millimeter so  this one the biggest thing is it's a  single stack you're gonna notice that  the width is a lot smaller than the rest  of them and that is  because the magazine is a not-so  staggered that it's going that it's  making that that magazine wider which is  making the gun wider so this Glock is  meant for concealed carry you know the  the slim nature of it makes it easy to  conceal against your waist whatever it  is the barrel length is coming in at  three point four inches so it's the  smallest barrel out of the bunch and  it's weighing only 16 ounces so that is  really light it's got all the same  standard functions you know you've got  your big magazine release here this  magazine is holding six rounds so if  you've got one in the chamber you can  have a total of seven rounds on you you  know same trigger same drop safety  everything safety wise is internally  we're not going to talk about what makes  clocks clocks because you're already  here biggest thing to remember about the  43 is that single stack it's small it's  light it's meant for concealed carry  so concealed carry is really your only  thing you're worried about 43 is a  fantastic option for that next up we're  gonna step up to the Glock 26 now this  one again is meant for that concealed  carry option the big difference though  is that we have a double stack so the  rounds are staggered here allowing you  to carry a little more this one carries  10 rounds so you're getting four extra  rounds in the magazine here as well as  if you want one in the chamber you're  looking at 11 rounds which is awesome  for a concealed carry gun it is gonna be  a little bit thicker a little bit  heavier but still very very concealable  this barrel is still at 3.4 inches  but we're at 22 ounces now so we're  definitely going up in weight a little  bit but yeah so I'd still say this one's  primarily concealed carry it's not the  most fun to shoot at the range you know  it's got that short little you know you  kind of missing your pinkie there on the  grip so it goes underneath there there  are some grip extension if you want to  get your pinkie on there otherwise just  tuck that bad boy under wrap your hands  and it's not too bad to shoot but it's  not super fun to shoot at the range so  this is definitely definitely a  concealed carry centric gun next up in  the lineup we have the Glock 19 this is  your compact size so this is right in  the middle it's a fantastic sort of  compromise between all the sides it's  got a long enough barrel barrel length  here is four inches so it gives you a  little bit more stability at the range  stuff like that but the biggest  difference is that you can now get your  entire hand on there your pinkie has a  spot to go so it's still an easy gun to  shoot at the range you can shoot this  all day and it's not  kill your hands it's not gonna be  awkward to hold but it's still small  enough to concealed-carry you're also  getting five more rounds so this  magazine is gonna hold 15 rounds so  obviously great for concealed carry  obviously great at the range so you're  not reloading all the time wait why is  your at 24 ounces here so you're only  adding two ounces from that Glock 26 and  you're getting that pinky on there so  this is personally my choice for  concealed if I'm going with this with a  26 I do like the 43 for complete you  know easy summer carry or something like  that but if I can wear a jacket I can  wear a hoodie or something to conceal a  little bit easier I'm going with the 19  over the 26 it's easier to shoot the  range and it's it's not too much harder  to conceal next up we have the full-size  so this is the Glock 17 we're getting a  full four and a half inch barrel here  this thing is designed a little bit more  for range shooting you can see the grip  is a little bit longer here you can  easily get your whole hand on here  depending on your back straps you know  if you have big hands if you have small  hands it'll come it'll accommodate it'll  accommodate any size hand very very well  it's easy to shoot it's smooth to shoot  the longer barrel the bigger grip just  makes it so that you can be a little  more accurate time after time consistent  with it yeah it's definitely meant for  range I personally wouldn't conceal  carry it out of the magazine here you're  getting 17 rounds so you're only getting  two more rounds out of that 19 and that  extra length on the barrel and on the  grip makes it that much harder to  conceal so I personally wouldn't get  this one for concealed carry you know if  you're a bigger frame you want a little  bit bigger gun it's not impossible it's  just not what I'd recommend for  concealed carry this is definitely a  range gun I want to practice with want  to feel good with one two that's easy to  shoot right and last but not least in  the lineup we have the big boy this is  the Glock 34 so this is sort of the  match style gun out of the group this  one has a 5.3 inch barrel and it's  weighing in at 26 ounces I don't think I  mentioned by the way this one is 25  ounces so you're really only adding an  ounce from the 19 this one comes in at  26 ounces so you're just adding one more  ounce on there but you can see it's got  finger grooves here this thing easily  once again full size grip fits any size  hand very well the 5.3 inch barrel  makes this thing a breeze to shoot very  very low recoil high accuracy consistent  shooting gun you've also got a little  bit of a ported slide here to make it a  little bit lighter yeah it's a it's a  good gun this one is definitely  definitely made for that range time if  you're a competition shooter it's  obviously great for that but it's not  really concealed carry gun it's  something that would work fine for I  guess home defense and stuff like that  but this thing has definitely made for  range time if you demand that you know  high consistency accurate shots low  recoil this is definitely the way to go  I enjoy shooting the 34 probably the  most out of any of this lineup just  because it's so fun and accurate and  just awesome to shoot but it's a  nightmare to concealed carry it's 5.3  inches on the barrel it's just not meant  as a concealed carry gun if you're  looking for a range gun that's just a  blast to shoot that's competitive to  shoot and you demand a really good  shooting gun the 34 is fantastic for  that once again 17 full size option 19  is kind of your mid-sized kind of does  it all option 26 if you're looking for a  concealed carry kind of only option I  was a little more capacity and then the  43 here if you want that single stack  that easy super easy to carry slim style  but you're only carrying six rounds once  again that's the lineup for the 9  millimeters if you want those in 40 or  45 most of these sizes are available  just hit up Glocks website and you can  learn more about what size that carries  over to but that should give you kind of  a basic idea of what Glock should fit  what you're looking for anyways  that's all I got for e I hope this video  was helpful was insightful and yeah if  you have any questions leave them down  in the comments below if you enjoyed it  get that thumbs up button I will see you  next time on green light shooting thanks  so much for watching",1
azq0S0DKS50,"[Music]  do the rich people cringe and say don't  tell them that rock yes yes yes don't  tell people with the what you know  people poor  my father was the head of education PhD  all that stuff I go home and ask him  said why don't we learn about money in  school and he elected me says because  the government doesn't let us teach that  subject the government tells us what we  can teach and what we can't teach and I  thought that was strange and I said but  aren't we going to school to learn about  money he says no your job is to get a  job I said but you get a job to earn  money he goes no you're supposed to just  get a job no no no no no this is the  purpose of a job to earn money he goes  you're correct I said so why don't we  just learn about money I can skip the  job part you know and he got flustered  and he said why learn about money why  don't you ask your best friend's father  about money  I said why that's Mike so I asked him he  says because Mike's father is an  entrepreneur and I said what I'm what  are you is I'm an employee I'm a  government employee I went Oh what's the  difference this is the difference as an  entrepreneur must know about money or  they they're no longer entrepreneurs and  it says an employee doesn't have to know  anything about money because the  government will take care of my company  will take care of so I'm kidding I'm all  confused but I took my dad's advice and  I trundle over to Mike's father's office  and knocked on his door and I said hey  I'm here nine years old teach me about  money  he says beat it kid you know but that's  where the story fridge ted portage  started and finally through persistence  my rich dad sorry teaching me about  money on one condition and that  condition was he would never pay me  he says the moment I pay you you think  like an employee he says that's the trap  entrepreneurs work for free and now I'm  nine years old my head's going cracking  in half  he says you never want a paycheck I  understand that kid okay I got it and he  says well how do I make money he says  that's what a lunch burrowstrike around  looks like so how do I learn about money  so he would just break out I Monopoly  game board so I would work for free I  pick up cigarette butts and yet hotels  and restaurants and I would clean and do  menial tasks and as I got older I  started getting into office work and  marketing and accounting and I was an  apprentice basically but I was working  for free and he would teach me about  money but the way he taught me about  money was playing Monopoly and ice  finally one day I got upset I said well  when you gonna teach me about money is  what I think we're doing we're playing  Monopoly he goes no no no what do you  think we're doing  we're playing Monopoly so what do you  think we're doing so I don't know  I'm teach you about money and then  that's why you know you have one green  house you know he says there's many  formulas for great success in money  there's thousands of them but one of the  best ones found in the game of Monopoly  still as today for green houses one red  hotel said what he says one of the  greatest ways to acquire great wealth is  playing Monopoly in real life for green  houses one red hotel well is that all  there is he goes that's it and he says  what do you think I'm doing and I went I  don't know so then he took me out he  showed me his greenhouses and ten years  later when I was 19 I was now in school  in New York and I come back to Hawaii  and rich debt had bought  the biggest piece of land smack-dab in  the middle of Waikiki Beach and when you  go to Waikiki Beach today you'll see the  Hyatt Regency Hotel that was his hotel  just like the game of Monopoly just like  the game of Monopoly acquired assets and  they became bigger assets  he just kept what's called an assemblage  because that property wasn't that big at  that time so he had to buy out all the  small guys cuz Waikiki was a little dirt  but a little town so he'd buy out this  shop owner and buy that shop owner and  it took him a while but he finally  assembled this large piece of property  and then he and he and Hyatt put up this  giant hotel you know I just and it just  sold for 800 million dollars so that's  how I learned about money  [Music]  I've had financial crashes I've had  people stab me in the back but they're  all good because I grow from it  that's spirituality you know people who  are afraid of making mistakes like they  teach in school they don't have a grow  because spirituality is as good and  there's bad the right and as wrong is up  and there's down most people don't want  to be right all I want to be positive  well you can't have that that's not  reality well I wasn't poor by most  people's standards but I came from a  family with a poor attitude if you know  what I mean because rich poor middle  class poverty starts with a fundamental  attitude poverty has passed on it's  taught in your families and middle  classes taught in families and so the  people right now who are sitting at home  mmm who are struggling financially or  worried about money or unhappy they may  be making a lot of money but unhappy  with what they're doing  it was probably taught to you know your  super-ego was taught get a job work hard  or you'll never be rich or the rich or  evil or whatever it's a school system  will never teach you about money the  school system was designed to teach you  to be an employee which is important or  a doctor or a lawyer a specialist but  never about money and what most people  lack is rael business knowledge like  accounting you know like debt like taxes  you got to know that stuff but they  don't teach it in school to anybody  so and then when people ask me how did  your rich dad learn this when your poor  dad a pH they did it and the answer is  very simply my rich dad was okay my best  friend's father his father died when he  was 13 so his sore bitch dad had this  family business at 13 to run so here the  drop out of school which was his  blessing you know there's blessings and  you know sometimes a blessing doesn't  look like a blessing but it turned out  to be a blessing and then his teachers  became his bookkeeper his accountant his  attorney his banker his real estate  agents so he has what I call real  teachers not these fake teachers in  school you see most teachers in school  they're out of ethics they teach  subjects they don't they themselves  don't practice I asked the teacher I  said you know I'm in my third year of  calculus now it was called it was called  strength of materials I said am I ever  gonna use the stuff he goes no you know  said why do you teach it as I get paid  so do you ever use it because no  and that's why you know I you have to  win in life one of the things I  suggested people you're gonna find a  rail teacher versus a fake teacher and a  fake teacher if somebody doesn't do what  they teach in a real teacher is doing  what they teach every day so my  accountants my attorney is there in it  every single day that's how I learn  because every day I'm solving problems  in my business so I have I have  accountants and attorneys and bankers  and all these people on speed dial  because I'm solving problems with my  team I see you giving this knowledge out  and yeah that I do the rich people  cringe and say don't tell them that  right yes yes yes don't tell people what  you know people poor but you know  unfortunately the poor wasn't the Bible  I'm not real religious the poor will  always be amongst us because it starts  up here right it's that fear mentality  it's it's in their words you know and  the warrants become flesh got not really  religious I flunked out of Sunday School  also but when they say I can't afford it  or I can't do that they go down they  become what they say my PhD daddy says  what do you think I am made of money I  can't afford that and my Rich Dad would  say that's why he's poor poor people say  I can't afford it I can't do that I  don't have time because this is escape  it's an escape you know I mean it sees  it as that can't afford and your rich  dad used to say what instead of I can't  afford it how can I afford it how can I  do that  you know what would it take or why  should I do that he says that a question  opens a mind a statement closes the  might see when you say I can't afford it  your mind shuts down you become what you  say  rugby is a team sport but so is soccer  the rules are different and other people  are golfers they play by themselves and  so everybody's different so my game  financially is business number one  second is real estate so what I say to  young people is you find your game  [Music]  [Music] ",2
qJAi2DYCo8U,"this is a colt 1911 yeah you'll see no  there's no see there's no numbers on it  Cody Wilson has a vision of a future  without gun control pri  mark an 3d print a pistol at home or  privately build their own semi-automatic  rifle lethal untraceable unregulated  weapons and now that vision is one step  closer to reality after years of  fighting the US government in court  Wilson just won the right to publish  downloadable schematics for just about  any commercially available firearm  online this is the direct material and  visual expansion of the right to keep  him around five years ago Wilson's  organization defense distributed  released plans for the world's first 3d  printable gun they called it the  Liberator but just days after the group  posted those files the State Department  demanded that they be removed for  violating weapons export controls  defense distributed complied but then  filed a lawsuit claiming it's right to  publish gun files was a form of  protected free speech we said no we're  Americans Americans have the right axis  is data  unquestionably and that the Internet is  now the Commons in a way that libraries  and things were in the past now the  group has essentially won its case its  settlement with the State Department  will allow it to once again upload gun  files designed for DIY gunsmiths and  promises to open the door for others to  do the same is it the end of gun control  like I think it is an essential sense  it's not quite that simple for now  homemade weapons have been involved in  at least two mass shootings in the last  five years but they represent just a  fraction of the wider gun control debate  in America when criminals and dangerous  people are able to create their own guns  in their homes it will become a issue in  the near future Wilson sees his project  as a trump card against the gun control  movement that's intensified in the wake  of February's Parkland school shooting  they left 17 people dead the fence  distributed is using its legal wind to  launch what it hopes will become the  Internet's most comprehensive repository  of digital gun files and as digital  fabrication tools like 3d printers and  computer-controlled milling machines  become cheaper and more than  the fence distributed hopes to unlock a  new generation of DIY gunsmithing beyond  all regulation you cannot regulate the  digital material of guns anymore it's  out there the floods there everyone's  got it we translated our culture into  the 21st century it's here it's going to  grow the group already makes themselves  its own milling machine called the ghost  gunner that can produce frames for  ar-15s and 1911 handguns three years ago  I tried out that machine and easily  built a working air 15 in Wired's office  it's untraceable I didn't have to go  through a background check or any sort  of waiting period to get it the  government has no knowledge of its  existence  Wilson recently gave me a tour of  defense distributed Austin headquarters  Gus Connor is a desktop milling machine  people have such a demand to make  private rifles of private firearms and  sells guns with no numbers then we built  an application you know purpose-made to  help you do that  neither the State Department nor the  Department of Justice would comment on  the settlements the Wilson sees it as  the next chapter in his anarchist  open-source firearms playbook it's  almost like we're creating a platform  for a new propulsive force in our  movement the company is digitizing as  many guns as possible by taking

YWhk90ktKtg,"this is a graph of the unemployment rate  throughout modern history here is the  average unemployment rate at about 4.5%  here is the unemployment rate after the  dot-com bubble burst and 9/11 that was  at about 6% here is the unemployment  rate during the financial crisis of 2008  that was at a whopping 10% and here is  what Treasury secretary Steve minuchin  said could happen to the unemployment  rate at some time this year it is  reported that the Senate and US  lawmakers were warned of a 20 percent  unemployment rate that could be coming  in the near future this would be the  highest unemployment rate since the  worst parts of the Great Depression and  if you don't believe that this is gonna  happen well we are already seeing signs  that it is unemployment websites for the  state of Ohio New York New Jersey and  Washington DC have all crashed this week  and in Ohio specifically they received  36,000 645 unemployment claims just on  Monday alone that is typically what they  would receive during an entire month and  the results were similar in Pennsylvania  where 50,000 people made unemployment  claims and Minnesota had 31,000 claims  and in fact if that wasn't enough the  American Hotel and Lodging Association  has already reported that four million  jobs in the travel-related industries  have already been lost in the last month  or are on the verge of being lost in the  next few weeks unless there is some  drastic change to the current economic  situation now if that's true that would  almost double the current unemployment  rate by itself now if that wasn't bad  enough we're also seeing reports that  nearly 50% of all hotels in the United  States could face closures by the end of  this year and this is all being backed  up by several respected economic  Institute's that have reported that it's  likely three to four million jobs will  be lost in the next several months in  the United States which would be on pace  with the worst months of the Great  Depression so the economic trajectory of  the global economy might be the worst it  has ever been in history and to prevent  this governments all around the world  have  firing off every possible economic  policy that they can in order to create  economic stability and thus far well  nothing has worked for example when the  Federal Reserve reduced interest rates  to zero percent the very next day was  one of the worst trading days in the  history of the stock market another  example is that the United States  government announced eight hundred and  fifty billion dollar stimulus package to  the economy yet the next day the market  cratered another nine percent and  finally the big banks have received two  trillion dollars worth of loans from the  Federal Reserve in the last seven days  in an attempt to help stabilize the  market yet market volatility actually  increased and is at a higher level than  it was during the financial crisis of  2008 now taking into account everything  that has happened to the economy over  the past few weeks we have seen roughly  25 to 40 trillion dollars worth of  losses since February think about that  for a second 40 trillion dollars has  just vanished and this is not even being  talked about by most people it seems  that every day we are waking up to  trillion dollar losses in the economy  yet no one is mentioning the potential  repercussions that this will bring to  the lives of the average person and some  of these repercussions might actually be  quite surprising let me explain see  during the Great Depression worldwide  GDP fell by more than fifteen percent  unemployment shot up over 20 percent and  global production of virtually  everything fell by more than 50 percent  and because of this the world well  became poor all of a sudden a family  that was living paycheck-to-paycheck in  the middle class they were now  struggling to be able to even purchase  food you saw many other people losing  their jobs in their life savings which  caused a doubling of the suicide rate  during this period and you also saw  infants and children Whang significantly  less than normal which caused some  long-term negative health effects such  as much higher blood glucose levels and  a much higher risk of obesity by about  50% when these children grew up overall  the quality of life for the average  person around the world dropped off a  cliff during this time but there was a  strange thing that happened despite all  of the negative consequences that came  with it the horrible economy life  expectancy and overall health  surely increased here's why what happens  when the economy tanks  well people become poor and when this  happens people need to make different  choices with their money so what you saw  during the Great Depression was a  reduction in smoking a reduction overall  obesity a reduction in traffic accidents  and there was also a significant  improvement in overall air quality due  to the lack of industrial activity and  as you might have heard we've actually  seen a reduction in pollution all around  the world due to all of the lockdowns  that are occurring now all of these  factors during the Great Depression  actually led to slightly better overall  health for the average person despite  the quality of life being significantly  lower than it was before  they kind of lived by the motto use it  up wear it out to make do or do without  that was a very common phrase back then  now after saying all of this there have  been more recent conflicting studies  about health effects during a recession  for example several studies have found  that the 2008 financial crisis may have  resulted in the deaths of several  hundred thousand people this is because  during that time wealth for the average  person and funding for health programs  all dried up therefore causing people to  not get the care that they need it but  the main repercussion that I think of  when considering this economic downturn  is the impact it will have on the daily  life of the average person I mean most  people in the world are already living  paycheck to paycheck and only have a few  thousand dollars worth of savings and  that can only get people so far now  imagine what's going to happen if all of  a sudden they are either laid off have  to take a pay cut or have reduced hours  at work this is going to be the scenario  for many people out there that are  already struggling to get by and  unfortunately their struggle might only  get worse really soon now another thing  that we typically see during times of  economic hardship is something that some  of you might find to be an oxymoron and  that is government efficiency during  economic downturns we see near lightning  speed of passing of bills and reforms  that typically would take years to go  through in the 1930s we saw the New Deal  get implemented in just three months and  I mean right now President Trump is  pushing for a temporary universal basic  income policy where all Americans will  be receiving $1,000 a month until the  lock downs  lift it and think about that that was  considered an extreme left-wing policy  up until just a few weeks ago but when  there's enough fear in the eyes of both  the public and politicians you typically  see a lot of unification and agreement  on a drastic changes in policy so that  brings up a few key points I want to  touch on where is this influx of public  money coming from and where is the  vanishing money going so let's tackle  the first question the ability for the  US government to pump in over 1 trillion  dollars worth of economic stimulus does  not come from tax dollars well not yet  you see the government is actually  taking out debt in order to give money  to the public right now in hopes that in  better economic times taxes will be  raised so the government can pay back  this debt in a sense the US government  is borrowing money from the present day  American investors in financial  institutions in hopes of paying them  back in the future so this means that  even though your tax dollars today may  not be going towards the economic  stimulus package it does mean that a  small portion of all of your tax bills  for years to come  will go towards paying back this debt  from the stimulus package so all in all  the government is trying to limit the  bad times today at the cost of limiting  the good times of tomorrow now let's  tackle the second question where is the  vanishing money going I mean I mentioned  how trillions of dollars are being wiped  out daily but what does this actually  mean well it's actually due to two  factors the first of which is that there  is a lack of production due to the  lockdowns so for example let's say  you're back in medieval times and you  have a small piece of steel that is  worth around $30 to the market but  through your own productivity and skill  set you are able to turn this useless  piece of steel into a much more useful  sword now even though the material is  the exact same as it was before you have  now created a more valuable item that  might be worth $200 instead of just $30  and that example is being applied all  around the world today many people are  in lockdowns and aren't able to utilize  their normal productivity which is  creating less value to the overall  economy secondly there is something  called crowd psychology you see  the value of anything is solely based on  well psychology this can range from  objects like cars or TVs to services  like cleaning or haircutting all the way  to currency like the American dollar  back in the day an American dollar was  backed by gold meaning that you could  convert your money into a proportional  amount of gold but after the abandonment  of the gold standard in 1971 the  American dollars value was solely based  on what the world thought the American  dollar was worth so if the entire  population woke up tomorrow and thought  the American dollar was worthless then  the American dollar would actually be  worthless now think of what this means  for the current stock market crash why  is Apple worth two hundred and thirty  billion dollars less today than it was a  few weeks ago is it because they lost  two hundred and thirty billion dollars  worth of Apple products or had two  hundred thirty billion dollars stolen  from their corporate bank accounts nope  it is because of crowd psychology and  indirectly supply and demand a large  reason why the price of Apple and the  value of the entire stock market has  dropped is because most people are  scared to invest in stocks right now and  rightfully so in a time of uncertainty  in the economy people would rather hold  on to their money and not lose it while  trying to avoid investing in a company  where it may go down 20% in just a few  weeks and this is how trillions of  dollars are vanishing from the economy  right now the lock downs are causing  decrease in overall economic value and  productivity and that is being combined  with the fear of economic uncertainty  and the trouble is all of this creates a  positive feedback loop if everyone were  to hold on to their money in perpetuity  then the economy would not work by  holding on to your money and not  spending it at the local restaurant that  you're used to shopping at you are  causing that local business to lose  money and potentially go ahead of  business this causes the loss of more  jobs and creates more fear about the  economy which causes more people to hold  on to their money this cycle continues  until we hit a bottom like the recession  that we are  to go through and I do realize that the  main reason that people are not going  out to restaurants right now is because  of the lockdown itself that is the cause  but the effect that this has is still  the very same you know it's very weird  thinking about all this about how  trillions of dollars could just  disappear simply because of productivity  and psychological factors but this is  the world we're living in and one of the  last things I want to leave you with is  what might happen to the average person  and the economy going forward the first  thing is that there is a chance that you  will lose your job this year  if you work in a service industry or a  travel related industry you will likely  be affected the most but if you work in  something like the tech industry you  will probably have a good amount of  insulation from this recession but  regardless of what your situation is  just be prepared and don't be stupid  with your money now another thing I want  to mention is that we are going through  unprecedented slowdown in the global  economy in fact this is arguably the  fastest drop in history but what this  also means is that we might also see one  of the quickest rebounds in history I  mean you think about it the main cause  for this recession is worldwide lock  downs where people will just can't work  so if all of those lock downs were to be  lifted in the next few weeks or maybe a  couple months then theoretically we can  see a pretty quick rebound from this  recession now I just would like to say  that the rebound will not be anywhere  near as fast as the fall because it  takes months or even years for new  businesses to open up again but it only  takes a few weeks for businesses to go  bankrupt which is what we're seeing  today unfortunately and my hopes is that  as soon as life returns to normal  hopefully that'll be a good enough  kickstart to get us out of this  recession fairly quickly because it's  really tough seeing people out there  struggle like this and the last thing  I'd like to mention and kind of ask you  guys is what do you think of the  economic repercussions of what is  happening right now are you scared of  the economy going forward do you think  we will have a quick rebound let me know  in the comments down below I also have  some other videos like this in my  documentaries playlist so please check  that out and I'm also putting out videos  like this once

BkbztWS4-9I,"how do you handle an epidemic  in the age of fake news there are the  carefully orchestrated official messages  I fully understand public concern  science-based driven by expert advice  currently the evidence from China at  least would imply that children aren't  have much less of this disease backed up  by advertising and the mainstream media  but then there's the lies rumors  theories that spread at speed around  social media and the Internet a new  challenge for governments treading the  line between information preparedness  and panic you can never prevent people  from panicking or from speculating about  possible causes particularly in health  situations however I think that what we  are seeing is a much more proactive  stance from some of the social media  companies compared to what we saw in  response to disinformation in elections  the battle against an infidel ik is won  the World Health Organization has been  fighting it has reportedly held meetings  with tech groups like Facebook Amazon  and Airbnb about providing accurate  information today Facebook's founder  pledged to act offering free adverts to  the w-h-o and saying they would remove  false claims and block exploitative ads  if the social media platforms can do  this now it does raise questions for  their future about whether they are  bringing themselves into much more into  the establishment much more into the  role of say a broadcaster that has to  take responsibility for what's on their  platforms and the effects that it has  but another weapon against the spread of  fake online news is government's  themselves the provision of clear  credible information is a crucial part  of the battle well the closed strategy  is something that nobody recommends  where people recommend is  powering the population by helping them  understand what's going on and what they  need to be watching out for in order to  prevent themselves from getting infected  and to prevent others from getting  infected from them so it's really  openness that is necessary in these  outbreaks we have contained this we have  contained this I won't say air type of  pretty close to air tight what does that  mean for countries where leaders have  seemed keen to play down the seriousness  of the situation politicizing the  coronavirus think of it and this is  their new hoax nonetheless the Trump  White House says it took strong action  early on and in truth Western  democracies are generally pretty good at  disseminating information to their  citizens the u.s. administration's  policy advisor told news night that he  questioned whether Iran's tight hold on  information had exacerbated the spread  of the disease there the regime did  delay telling its own people about the  outbreak of the corona virus and as the  consequence people didn't take the  necessary precautions and today Iran has  the highest death rate in the world of  coronavirus I saw an interview with the  doctor and the Cuza Stan province who  said that the regime covered it up for a  month and then once the once it was  clear that they had an epidemic the  regime wasn't prepared for it if faith  in politicians or indeed the media is  important in a public health crisis  covert 19 perhaps hit at the wrong time  there is still an inclination to look in  some odd places for answers look what I  don't like in life is that a very  serious thing a football manager his  opinion is important  politics coronavirus why me have a base  cap and  the bed shade the challenges have barely  began but this new virus could also  raise some very 21st century questions  about the gatekeepers to information in  a crisis and ultimately about who we  trust joining me now is Victoria Bane's  a former Facebook trust and Safety  Manager and Anna Sophie Harlan from News  Guard and online browser extension which  reports on digital misinformation and  monitors news websites for reliability  and annasophia if we start with you  you've been having a look at inaccurate  sources of information online when it  comes to coronavirus what have you found  so we've seen that overwhelmingly users  around the globe when they're going on  sources on like Facebook and Twitter are  accessing what we would call read rated  sources are unreliable sources of Crona  information we've seen that sources like  a w8 show and the u.s. Center for  Disease Control and have amassed shares  and engagements on Facebook over the  last couple of weeks around 34,000  whereas the read rated health sources  that are spreading coronavirus  misinformation have amassed something  like fifty two million engagements and  that's quite shocking we're seeing  similar numbers coming out of the UK and  despite Facebook's best efforts the NHS  website is not receiving much traffic in  the UK as opposed to some US red rated  sources actually that we're seeing being  shared widely in the UK Victoria  Facebook's made this announcement but  how easy is it for them to take down  this sort of information misinformation  from what I understand and from what  we've seen reporting and taking down the  material when it's been reported it's  just one of the measures that companies  like Facebook and I would say also  Google with Google search and with  YouTube that are they're taking at the  moments they're working with the World  Health Organization and with the NHS so  they have a hotline if you like from  those official sources but they're also  promoting those official sources so  people logging into Facebook today and  using Google search today will have  noticed that  SOS alerts at the top of their news  feeds and on their search pages when  they search for coronavirus them behind  the scenes there will also be another  approach to try and investigate identify  and remove some possible sources of  coordinated disinformation which is  something that President Putin of course  has alluded to today it's not impossible  that hostile actors will be looking to  sow disinformation deliberately what  you're saying Ana Sophie the  misinformation is spreading almost as  quickly as the virus I mean we've had a  look I mentioned some of them earlier  but you know anti-vaxxers talking about  this being a weaponized disease yeah a  weaponized you know issue you know that  it's gonna undermine brexit all sorts of  kind of crazy ideas are out there it's  just spreading yeah and it's not new  coronavirus didn't cause misinformation  online misinformation disinformation has  existed for about as long as the tech  platforms have existed right and what  we're seeing is that this is being  brought to the foreground that the tech  platforms are really taking action now  but what we a new scart would like to  see is that these sorts of actions  promoting quality content and bringing  greater transparency to the platforms  educating consumers about how to locate  quality sources this is something that  should extend beyond coronavirus it's  really the kind of actions we would want  the tech platforms to see every day to  empower consumers with quality  information you touched on it earlier  but is it more Russian bots for example  spreading these conspiracy theories or  more people who are misinformed and just  putting things that are wrong online so  far we've not seen a lot of evidence of  Russian bots although that may emerge  over time and to follow on from what  Anna Anna Sophia was saying that what I  would really like to see is much more  responsibility from members of the  public to check what they are seeing  because there is a very good analogy  between cybersecurity and the spread of  infection it's not for nothing that we  talked about computer viruses spreading  and you know computer infections and I  would like to see people taking  responsibility for what they share with  their friends and family in exactly the  same way as we talked about not  coughs and sneezes I would just like to  add to that and that when you give  people that responsibility you also need  to give them the tools to make informed  decisions and I think that's why it's  really important to educate online users  about how to locate quality sources how  to identify for themselves for example  who might be behind a certain website  what might their motivations be aside  from bots and from sort of foreign-born  propaganda really seeing in terms of  online health myths and disinformation  are malicious actors who take advantage  of the fear and the hysteria surrounding  coronavirus right now or vaccines or any  kind of health issue in order to turn a  profit so they might be publishing false  information to get ad clicks or they  might be simply trying to promote a  certain product often times that can be  quite harmful product so you do need to  teach people to think about what is this  person trying to get from me why is this  message coming across and are they  trying to motivate from my attention or  from my fear and how likely is it that  people will realize they have to  self-regulate and that they will have  the tools to do that that's really  challenging actually we live in an  environment where we are encouraged by  our online interactions to click now to  click on an offer now to click on an ad  now so delaying that gratification is  one of the challenges that those of us  who work in cyber security have it's  it's why we have a challenge stopping  people clicking on links to malicious  software in phishing emails for instance  so it is it is very much the holy grail  of cyber security but I think I would  also stress that we have that promotion  of the legitimate materials so some of  those hoaxes should be pushed down down  ranked by the promotion of the  legitimate material remains annasophia  Harlan thank you so much ",3
m5fsidSOJMw,"Voices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare.  People who are willing to speak out  about the government’s attempts to control news  about the deadly coronavirus.  They asked to remain anonymous,  because what they’re doing could  put them and their families at great risk.  But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens,  fighting to get the message out  in a country that aggressively censors information.  Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech  are quickly scrubbed from the internet.  Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about  life under lockdown.  [clanging]  Posted online one day, but gone the next.  But the crisis over the coronavirus  is changing the landscape, for now at least.  Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting  information the government doesn’t want out there.  Experts say this kind of digital resistance  is happening at a scale they’ve never seen before.  Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter  are blocked in China.  But internet savvy people use techniques  that allow them to repost censored content  to these platforms, while staying under the radar  of authorities.  They’re creating a visual archive  by preserving videos like this one,  showing overwhelmed hospitals.  [screaming]  And they’re reposting people’s personal stories.  Some are also turning to less obvious platforms,  including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders.  Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on?  They’re making open and widespread calls  for freedom of speech.  These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang.  He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus,  and was punished by officials for speaking out.  He died in early February from the coronavirus.  Right after his death, the hashtag  “I want freedom of speech” started to trend  on Weibo, a Chinese social media site.  Then, it was quickly censored by the government.  Dr. Li’s become an icon in the online fight  for freedom of speech between censors and citizens.  So, who’s winning?  For now, citizens are staying a step ahead  of the authorities.  But a renewed government crackdown  could test the strength of this digital resistance. ",3
6Af6b_wyiwI,"When I was a kid,  the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.  That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement,  filled with cans of food and water.  When the nuclear attack came,  we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.  Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe  doesn't look like this.  Instead, it looks like this.  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades,  it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus  rather than a war.  Not missiles, but microbes.  Now, part of the reason for this is that  we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.  But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.  We're not ready for the next epidemic.  Let's look at Ebola.  I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper,  lots of tough challenges.  I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools  we use to track polio eradication.  And as you look at what went on,  the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough,  the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.  In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.  We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone,  seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.  The case reports came in on paper.  It was very delayed before they were put online  and they were extremely inaccurate.  We didn't have a medical team ready to go.  We didn't have a way of preparing people.  Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.  But even so, we were far slower than we should have been  getting the thousands of workers into these countries.  And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.  There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.  No one to look at the diagnostics.  No one to figure out what tools should be used.  As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors,  processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.  But that was never tried.  So there was a lot that was missing.  And these things are really a global failure.  The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.  Now, in the movies it's quite different.  There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go,  they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.  The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic  to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola  Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.  About 10,000 people died,  and nearly all were in the three West African countries.  There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.  The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.  They found the people and they prevented more infections.  The second is the nature of the virus.  Ebola does not spread through the air.  And by the time you're contagious,  most people are so sick that they're bedridden.  Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.  And that was just luck.  If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas,  the case numbers would have been much larger.  So next time, we might not be so lucky.  You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious  that they get on a plane or they go to a market.  The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola,  or it could be bioterrorism.  So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.  In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air,  like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.  So here's what would happen:  It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.  And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.  So this is a serious problem.  We should be concerned.  But in fact, we can build a really good response system.  We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.  We've got cell phones  to get information from the public and get information out to them.  We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.  We have advances in biology  that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen  and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.  So we can have tools,  but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.  And we need preparedness.  The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared  are again, what we do for war.  For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.  We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.  NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.  NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?  Do they understand about fuel and logistics  and the same radio frequencies?  So they are absolutely ready to go.  So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.  What are the key pieces?  First, we need strong health systems in poor countries.  That's where mothers can give birth safely,  kids can get all their vaccines.  But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.  We need a medical reserve corps:  lots of people who've got the training and background  who are ready to go, with the expertise.  And then we need to pair those medical people with the military.  taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics  and secure areas.  We need to do simulations,  germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.  The last time a germ game was done in the United States  was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well.  So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.  Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.  There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus,  that could work very, very quickly.  Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost,  but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.  The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,  global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars  and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.  These investments offer significant benefits  beyond just being ready for the epidemic.  The primary healthcare, the R&D,  those things would reduce global health equity  and make the world more just as well as more safe.  So I think this should absolutely be a priority.  There's no need to panic.  We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.  But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.  In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,  it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.  If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.  Thank you.  (Applause) ",1

ten deep-sea  mysteries sailors have encountered only  a few colossal squids all of them dead  and badly damaged the oceans roadkill  for this list we're only interested in  underwater mysteries not mysterious  events are phenomena that take place on  the surface of the deep blue based on  the destruction of the whale carcass  that we have seen that had been attacked  by the predator we know that we're gonna  need a much much bigger decoy number 10  the Gulf of Mexico shipwreck there may  be more than 2,000 known shipwrecks  scattered across the seabed in the Gulf  of Mexico but few have captured the  attention of both the public and  scientists like this vessel estimated to  be 200 years old and hidden away below  some 2600 feet of water this ship has  been the subject of one of the most  elaborate and challenging underwater  archaeological expeditions in history it  was discovered by chance during the  laying of an ExxonMobil pipeline  multiple underwater Rovers have been  sent down to gather information but  every attempt has consistently suffered  from unlikely technical failures leading  some to believe that the ship is cursed  and meant to remain a mystery you better  go to your n1 number 9 the colossal  squid the Kraken might be a mythical  creature but the colossal squid is big  elusive and scary enough to work as a  stand-in to put the colossal squid in  perspective let's consider these  slightly smaller giant squid first  caught on film in 2012 the giant squid  has been known to measure up to 43 feet  long and weigh an estimated 1,000 pounds  the colossal squid on the other hand  reaches up to 46 feet long and a  whopping 1,650 pounds while the giant  squids tentacles feature suckers with  teeth on them the colossal squid boasts  a number of sharp hooks  only one mature living specimen has ever  been caught and studied leaving us with  many unanswered questions about this  deep-sea monster number eight lepto  Seppala CG Gatti's what's longer the  body of the elusive giant left a  cephalus or the name of the man who  first described it  Peter Henry John Cassell the specimen  caught by Cassell off the coast of New  Zealand in 1959 measured roughly 35  inches in length but its Anatomy was  consistent with the larval stage of the  species suggesting that in eel terms it  was just a baby  considering that lepto supplier  typically two to four inches in length  castle's discovery certainly sparked  controversy based on his calculations an  adult left Assefa less could grow into a  98 footlong eel once it fully matures  other examples of El Gigante us have  been reported but no one has come across  a mature specimen to confirm castles  theory number seven the Aegean Sea ruins  has one of the world's oldest  civilisations Greece certainly has its  fair share of historical sites but the  Aegean Sea ruins present one of the most  noteworthy discoveries in recent Greek  history found off the coast of Delos in  2014 what first appeared to be the  remains of a port was later discovered  to be a pottery workshop complete with  kiln and various pots a retaining wall  pathways towers and other unidentified  buildings covering nearly 12 acres of  seabed Greek media outlets have dubbed  it an underwater Pompeii the failed  coastal settlement is estimated to have  succumbed to the sea some 4,500 years  ago researchers suspect it may be the  ancient city of Kane where the Athenians  defeated the Spartans  but tonight we died number six the Cuban  underwater city the discovery of an  ancient underwater city is always cause  for excitement but when that city sits  beneath one of the most mysterious  geographical locations on earth the  Bermuda Triangle  wild theories abound in 2001 sonar scans  off the coast of Cuba revealed a series  of distinctly geometric structures  considering the structures sit at a  depth of 2,000 to 2,400 60 feet  underwater it's hard to fathom how or  when they would have been constructed  some experts have gone so far as to say  they can identify pyramids and even a  Sphinx other theories have called it the  lost city of Atlantis curiously there's  been a distinct lack of follow-up  research which has many conspiracy  theorists yelling cover-up world leaders  signed secret memos directing scientific  studies of alien technology and  biochemistry number five the Baltic Sea  anomaly there is estimated to be over  100 thousand shipwrecks sitting at the  bottom of the Baltic Sea and they may  not all be from this planet known by  some as the Baltic UFO this anomaly was  discovered by ocean ex-team a group of  Swedish divers the structure roughly 200  feet in diameter has prompted numerous  theories as to just what it could be a  spaceship an anti-submarine device or  simply a geological formation but the  distinct shape of the structure which  bears an uncanny resemblance to the  Millennium Falcon coupled with the fact  that electronic devices seem to stop  functioning when near it keeps people  questioning its origins what a piece of  junk  so make point 5 past light speed it may  not look like much but she's got it  where it counts kid number four the  milky sea effect we may have the  technology to understand the how of this  mystery but scientists are still  scratching their heads as to the why for  centuries sailors have described  crossing mysterious milky glowing  patches of sea seafarers are known to be  a superstitious lot so little stock was  put into these tales until 1985 when a  research team managed to take samples of  the milky seawater they identified the  cause as bacterial in nature finally  giving this seafaring story legs to stay  while subsequent studies and satellite  imaging have given us a better  understanding of this bioluminescent  phenomenon which can cover an area the  size of Connecticut we have yet to  understand why the bacteria suddenly  congregate in this manner  [Music]  number three surviving megalodons  according to wikipedia the Megalodon is  officially extinct most scientific  sources agree with that position but  thanks to the Discovery Channel's  Megalodon the monster shark lives which  was marketed as a dramatized documentary  I believe that we just encountered  Megalodon  there is renewed interest in the  possible continued existence of this  fierce predator it's estimated at a  maximum of fifty nine feet long three  times larger than the biggest great  white shark the coelacanth fish was  thought dead for 65 million years before  it's rediscovery in 1932 and the 15 foot  long megamouth shark was unknown until  1972  so maybe the Megalodon is still around  holy shit  after all there have been countless  eyewitness reports of sharks in excess  of 50 feet in length which also helps  keep this myth alive you're gonna need a  bigger potion number two the Bimini Road  multiple underwater ruins have claimed  the title of the real lost city of  Atlantis impossible you say well no no  not for them but few inspire enthusiasm  like this large arrangement of stones in  the Bahamas although some have dubbed it  the road to Atlantis it's more often  called the Bimini Road due to its  location beneath the water near North  Bimini Island later expeditions suggest  the Bimini wall may be more appropriate  running a half mile long and made of  sandstone blocks it's one of three  similar patterns of rock formations in  the area whether it's a road or an  ancient wall no one can quite figure out  how the stones were engineered to create  such a captivating and perplexing sight  Nature doesn't do that man does and they  realized this is a harbor a breakwater  for a harbor before we unveil our number  one pick here are some honorable  mentions  [Music]  what's gonna weigh to shock that beak  what could kill a three mated great one  there was no doubt the seemingly  indomitable shark alpha had been  attacked and eaten by a super predator  of the deep number one the Atlantis of  Japan two thousand years ago a city sank  into the ocean off the coast of Yonaguni  Jima following massive seismic activity  or so the story goes as is the case with  many underwater discoveries the Yonaguni  monument and its surrounding structures  have been dismissed by some as a rock  formation naturally shaped by erosion  however the structures are distinct in  their sharp angles animal-like shapes  and apparent columns leading many to  side with the ancient civilization  argument right there God does not build  in straight lines the most difficult  structure to defend as having been  naturally formed is a stepped pyramid  that stands at 25 meters in height  according to a local marine geologist  Masaaki Kimura this may be mu one of  several lost continents theorized  throughout the ages  [Music]  [Music]  do you agree with our list what deep sea  mystery do you find to be the most  interesting are the stone slabs the work  of man or merely a highly unusual  natural formation for more elusive top  10s published every day be sure to  subscribe to watchmojo.com  [Music]  you ",3
ezJrzGajsNg,"[Music]  so Alexander Smith is back in the news  what do you mean who's that he's the  entirely credible alleged time traveler  who claims to have been sent to the air  21-18 on a secret mission for the CIA  doesn't say well I mission was doesn't  say how he got there but he's got a  blurry photograph for us also yeah  checks out now I know for a fact that  time travel won't be possible in my  lifetime because obviously I would  already have come back to right now to  make out with myself but there's just  there's just so many people who claim to  have done it that that yes I'm going to  have to do a video on it I'm what  cultures Adam Cleary and these are seven  people who travelled through time  allegedly number seven Chaplin's time  traveler seven years ago a filmmaker  from Northern Ireland by the name of  George Clark claimed that he had  discovered evidence for time travel in  the DVD extras of the circus a Charlie  Chaplin movie released in 1928 because  where else the clip he uploaded to  YouTube taken from a video of the film's  premiere in Los Angeles purports to show  a woman speaking into a small black  device held up to the side of a head  just like a mobile phone now that's a  good 50 or so years before mobile phones  were even first thought of and nearly 80  before your parents finally got one so  yeah what the fuck I mean it seems  slightly odd that a time traveler who  I'm sure would have been super careful  not to have given themselves away on  that trip would casually walk around  flashing a bit of futuristic tech but  what am I the time police number six the  time-traveling hipster here's another  idiot time traveler one who unlike the  woman in the Charlie Chaplin video  apparently didn't even bother to try and  blend in with the contemporary culture  by buying some clothes the very second  he got there now I have seen Back to the  Future and that is an absolute  prerequisite according to some the above  picture shows a man from our time or  perhaps a little earlier casually  standing amongst a group of onlookers  from 1941 at the opening of the gold  bridge in Canada and it's absolutely not  untrue to say that he does look a little  out of place he's got sunglasses on for  one thing and  he appears to be wearing a button-up  shirt over a t-shirt like a massive  massive square experts claim that  although his getup was somewhat unusual  for the era all the clothes in there  were available to buy if he just you  know looked in the right stores imagine  being so trendy you kick off a  conspiracy for you Bravo sir  number 5 John Titor after capturing the  attention of an internet forum at the  turn of the millennium alleged military  time traveler John Titor  supported his claim that he had been  sent to the air 2036 with a series of  predictions about the near future now  you might have expected these to be  vague or bereft of detail in their  traditional style of doomsday preachers  who'll claim the end of the world is  definitely maybe perhaps coming in the  next more 10 to 200 years but tdawg  claimed the Olympic Games would soon be  discontinued that the United States  would descend into civil war in the  aftermath of the 2004 presidential  election and the long-awaited sequel  world war 3 would finally break out in  2015 now and I'll have to double-check  this but I'm pretty sure none of those  came true but that's alright though  because Tito's fans let's call them  Tito Luthor's claim as he simply  witnessed a different timeline to our  own so aren't ya I'm fine yeah I'm  perfect number 4 ha Karen Ord fist the  story of ha Connaught fist stands out  from the list of time traveler tales  insofar as he didn't claim to move  through time deliberately rather he says  he accidentally slipped the report all  while attending to a pipe underneath his  sink if I had a pound one proof well  this Swede actually recorded a video on  his mobile to document it it shows him  bumping into a 17-year old version of  himself and sharing a casual chat about  the fact that they had matching tattoos  on their lower arms to be fair the video  definitely depicts a pair of bold  Swedish blokes with the same body exist  no arguing with that granted they could  have just found two vaguely similar  looking bald men and drawn fake tattoos  on them but that seems to me like a lot  of hassle no no for me this one is  definitely legit  it definitely wasn't just part of a  viral marketing campaign designed to get  people in Sweden thinking about the  pension plans that would be rich  Kilis number three andrew carlson a man  by the name of Andrew Carlson was  supposedly arrested by US authorities in  2003 after turning $800 into three  hundred and fifty million dollars with a  series of high-risk trades in the stock  market leading to accusations of insider  trading according to legend the man told  police that the explanation for his  improbable run of fortune was that he  was actually a time traveler who had  gone back in time with the express  intention of making his fortune in  stocks shares with the investigators  quite understandably skeptical of his  claims call us an offer to give them  clues about things like the location of  a sama bin Laden or the cure for AIDS  in return for his release the story ends  with him mysteriously granted bail and  then abruptly disappearing without a  trace it's this part of long with  admittedly all of the other part that  makes you doubt whether it wasn't all  just some media hoax designed to sell a  few extra papers but I mean really come  on what's more likely a man breaking all  the known laws of physics or the media  being dishonest  number two the Philadelphia Experiment  in the list of things the US government  claims doesn't exist the Philadelphia  Experiment is right up there with  Roswell and effective gun legislation  thank God then for Internet conspiracy  theorists and their low-grade camera  equipment lookee here the military is  claimed to have ended one of its ships  temporarily invisible to enemies during  a top-secret mission in October 1943  they achieve this so it said by  traveling about ten minutes back in time  going a few minutes into the past by  messing around with electromagnetic and  gravitational forces beneath the seabed  is a lot more believable than the  concept of a time machine in which you  literally punch in your intended  destination like a microwave but  authorities have always denied that such  an experiment took place at all because  I mean obviously of course they would  and the science behind it is at best  sketchy number one Donald bloody Trump  yep this this is the best one  some experts act by that I mean 4chan  have postured the theory the trumps  improbable election success was  actually the result of time travel let's  unpack this in the 1940s John Trump big  Donnie's uncle was tasked with  investigating the work of Warren Nikola  Tesla yes he of the mad scientist /  mysterious genius Talia's appropriate  fame the story goes that big hunky Trump  claimed that there was nothing of value  in Tesla's work but secretly stole his  plans for a time machine fast forward  nearly eighty years into the future and  his nephew Donald was finally able to  make the thing work how you ask by  harnessing the lightning bolt that hit  the Trump Tower the night of the GOP  nomination with his new power he zipped  around in time correcting any mistakes  he made on a campaign trail and just  about got himself into the White House  now is that crazy I mean absolutely yes  it is but no more crazy than the idea  that he might have won the thing fair  and square  so yeah that's it mad wanna let us know  what you think

mQUhJTxK5mA,"You are watching Coldfusion TV  Welcome to another Coldfusion video  I'm going to start this video off with a quote.  Henry Ford once said:  ""It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system  for if they did I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.""  I quote this because it encapsulates the fact that  the contents of this video may be unsettling compared to the videos that i normally make.  I still feel compelled to make this video  because I've been exploring the financial world for the last four years  and it has definitely given me a more complete view of the world.  I want to share some of what i've come across with you guys  I'm also going to do a video about crypto-currencies like Bitcoin in the future  and to understand why Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies  may continue to rise, it's critical that you understand the contents of this video.  I hope that you find this topic interesting and that it inspires you  to do your own research afterwards.  Now, with that said, let's begin.  So who controls all of our money?  It's a simple question!  We all know that you and I don't control it.  Our employees don't controll it.  The companies that they work for don't control it.  So who does?  Where does it even come from in the first place?  I'll give you a hint...  Money does NOT come from the government  It's a seemingly obvious question that's never asked or taught in schools for some reason.  Unfortunately, most people's lives are basically dedicated to money.  It's all people ever worry about or talk about.  We go to school to learn basically how to go to university,  to learn the skills to get a good job  so that we can trade hours of our lives all for this thing called ""money"".  So why wouldn't you want to know where money comes from and who issues it?  Today, in this very special video, you're about to find out the answers to the question of  ""Who controls all of our money?""  People today can tell something isn't quite right with our financial system,  but they just can't put their finger on it.  Some people think it's the failure of government, others think that it's the failure of the capitalism itself  This video should clarify a few things.  The year is 1694 andEngland had just suffered through 50 years of war.  Exhausted, the English government needed loans to fund their political means.  Brainchild of Scottish banker William Paterson,  it was decided that a privately owned bank that could  issue the money to the government out of thin air was to be the solution.  This was the very first modern central banking system in the world.  Central banking is more influential than laws, governments and politicians,  but strangely not the focus of the general public.  Fast forward to the early 20th century, and after two failed attempts  a group of bankers wanted to put a central bank in the United States of America.  It was December of 1910 and senator Nelson Aldrich  boarded a private train car in New York with six others.  The six were not to be spotted by any news reporters to avoid questions.  Their destination: Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia.  The meeting went for nine days and  from that they created the Federal Reserve System.  This is all documented and a matter of public record.  Some of them went on to write about the meetings in their personal biographies.  Here is a quote from Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank of New York  February 9th 1935  in the Saturday Evening Post:  ""I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator.  Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted  If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill,  that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.  The six men that Nelson Aldrich brought together included the head of banks, branches of government  such as the Treasury and some of the richest people on Earth at the time.  To give you an idea of how rich they were  in 1910 these six men represented a quarter of the world's worth.  The bankers told the American public  that the purpose of the system was to stabilize the economy and to stop the grip of  the Wall Street banks over America.  The problem was the guys that wrote the bill were the very same people they said they'd stop.  If they succeeded, it would give a small group of men the ability to create money from nothing  and loan it to the American government with interest.  So why was it done in secret?  Because the American people didn't want a central bank.  Back then, unlike today, people knew what central banks were  and understood them very well.  Everywhere a central bank went, there would be wealth inequality,  wild swings between economic booms and busts  and after each bust, those in the top of society mysteriously came out richer,  while everyone else got poorer.  Europe was a running example of this at the time.  The Federal Reserve was originally drafted as the 'Aldrich bill',  but when it came into Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich's name  and smelled a rat.  The bankers needed better cover.  They decided to send two millionaire friends to carry the bill to quell the  suspicions of Congress and renamed it ""The Federal Reserve Act"".  Next in this textbook lesson of deceit  the bankers set out to fool the American people through disinformation.  In the newspapers of the day the bankers screamed and protested  against the new Federal Reserve bill.  ""It would ruin the banks!"" they exclaimed.  The average person read the protesting articles of the bankers and thought to themselves:  ""If the bankers hate it, it must be good""  and then they ended up unknowingly supporting a Trojan horse.  The bankers also fooled Congress by putting clauses in the bill that limited their power  only to remove them once the bill was passed.  A double head fake of the public and Congress - was all it took.  The bill was passed on December 23rd 1913 while most of Congress was out on holiday.  And with that, a small group had complete monopoly over the issuing and creation of American money.  Today the Federal Reserve is the most powerful entity in the United States  and they're not ashamed to admit it either.  Here is former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan.  What should be the proper relationship between the chairman of the Fed and a President of the United States?  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency  and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.  What the relationships are don't frankly matter.  In addition to this, it seems that the Fed can't even be touched by investigating parties.  So I'm asking you if your agency has in fact, according to Bloomberg,  extended nine trillion dollars in credit,  which, by the way, works out to 30,000 dollars to every single man woman and child in this country.  I'd like to know: if you're not responsible for investigating that, who is?  We actually have responsibility for the Federal Reserve's programs and operations  to conduct audits and investigations in that area.  In terms of who's responsible for investigating ...  Would you mind repeating the question one more time?  Mr. Chairman my time is up, but I have to tell you honestly  I am shocked to find out that nobody at the Federal Reserve, including Inspector General  is keeping track of this.  ""So what does all of this have to do with me?"" you might be asking.  ""I don't even live in the US""  Well, two reasons.  Number one: the central banking model from the Bank of England and the United States has now been put  in all countries and even consolidated power in parts of Europe as the European Central Bank or ECB  This unites separate countries under one economic policy.  The only places in the world that don't have central banks are North Korea, Iran and Cuba.  In 2000 this list suspiciously included Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.  And number two: since the end of World War II, the US dollar has been the reserve currency of the world.  This means that all central banks hold US dollars in their reserves.  In other words all other currencies are backed by the US dollar.  This directly links to your country to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy in America.  More on this later.  When the post- World War II monetary system, called the ""Bretton Woods"" system, was created,  all US dollars were backed by and exchangeable for gold.  A byproduct of this was that currencies used to be very stable in relation to each other.  For that, all the countries, the exchange rates were fixed and year after year  you could predict what prices were going to be.  You could start a business elsewhere,  you could calculate profits, business was much easier before floating exchange rates.  Unfortunately, in 1971, due to a falling US dollar, international capital flows into gold  and the funding of the Vietnam War,  President Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard.  I have directed secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar  into gold or other reserve assets.  Now the dollar was floating and backed by nothing and has been ever since.  So let's think a little: if the US dollar is backed by nothing  but the world reserves are backed by the US dollar intrinsically since 1971,  doesn't this mean that all currencies are now backed by nothing tangible, only trust in the American government?  Well, this is correct!  Money backed by nothing is known as ""fiat currency"".  ""Fiat"" in Latin means ""let it be done"".  In other words, the government says it is money, so it is.  A consequence to having money backed by nothing is that whenever the Federal Reserve creates money  it dilutes the currency supply of all other nations  because their reserves are backed by the US dollar.  All countries' reserves are worth less each time money is created.  In the past few years the Federal Reserve has printed trillions of dollars  and countries like Russia and China have noticed this.  As a reaction to the money printing, these countries have been selling US dollar reserves and buying gold  over the same period.  ""But wait a second!""  Some of you clever thinkers out there may have asked yourselves:  ""If every currency on Earth is backed by nothing, how am i able to pay for things?""  Well, as it turns out, the whole economic system today is running because it is backed by faith.  Faith that you can exchange your unit of currency for goods or services.  In a way, part of that faith comes from the fact that not many people actually know where money comes from.  We're about to find that out in this video.  A central bank is essentially the entity that manages a nation's money supply  and it can loan money to the government with interest.  In the United States and most other countries it works like this:  When the government needs more money than they received from taxes  they ask the Treasury Department for money.  The Treasury then receives an IOU or bond from the government.  The Treasury, through the banks, gives this IOU to the Federal Reserve.  The Fed then writes a check for this IOU and hands it to the banks.  At this exchange at the banks, money is created and it can be used to pay government bills.  So hang on!  Where does the Fed get the money to be able to write this check?  They get this money from nowhere! They literally just invent it.  Here's a quote from the Boston Federal Reserve:  ""When you or I write a check there must be sufficient funds in our account to cover the check.  But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn.  When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money"".  So, in essence, they're writing a check and creating money from an account that has no money in it.  The money the Federal Reserve creates can be used as legal tender to buy things  and eventually makes its way into the real economy.  If you and I did that, we would go to jail for fraud,  but they can do it because they invented the system.  This is the same system used throughout the world today  Another part of this money creation happens at the commercial bank side.  Every time you take out a loan to buy a house, car or TV, banks create money out of nowhere to give you this loan  and you still have to pay interest on it.  And don't just believe me when I say that.  Hear it for yourself from the horse's mouth, the people running the system,  Graham Towers, former governor of the Central Bank of Canada states:  ""Each and every time a bank makes a loan, new credit is created. New deposits. Brand new money.""  Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England:  ""Banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customers' current account.""  So what they're basically saying is that each time the bank makes a loan,  the bank doesn't use other people's deposited money and give it to you.  It creates new money.  In modern times this means typing digits into a computer.  97% of all money is digitally created like this.  Only 3% is the physical cash and coins that we carry.  Another crazy thing that commercial banks can do is lend out 10 times more money  than they actually have in reserves.  This is called fractional reserve lending.  So who wrote this ridiculous system into law?  For the United States, it was part of the Federal Reserve System drafted in 1913.  And again, this is the same system used throughout the world.  So what's the issue? Why should I even care?  Well there's consequences.  When more loans are given out more money is created  and the rest of the money in circulation is worth less and less as the years go on.  This is known as inflation.  In a way, inflation is basically a tax that we all pay for the fraud of money printing.  Easy money now in exchange for tax on our future generations.  It's also why in 1950 a house used to cost $7,000 and a car $2000.  Obviously, this is no longer the same today.  Things will always keep getting more expensive as long as this system is in place.  This was actually kind of OK because wages grew in relation to inflation until about 2008.  Why this stopped happening is a story for another day.  So things are already pretty crazy, but they get even crazier.  The more you look into it, the stranger things become.  So remember we were talking about how central banks and commercial banks can create money out of nothing  This procedure actually does create something.  It creates debt.  Let me explain:  When you take out a loan, it's written down as an asset in the bank  as a negative form, kind of like a negative value of money, or otherwise known as ""debt"".  Under this system, debt is actually money.  And again, don't just listen to me.  Marriner Eccles, former Governor of the Federal Reserve states:  ""If there are no debts in our money system, there wouldn't be any money.""  So, in essence, instead of gold being the backbone of our economy, it is now debt.  The system we're under now is sometimes referred to as ""the debt based monetary system"".  It requires that debt always grows.  Countries and people must become deeper in debt so that there's more money in the system,  because, remember,  debt is money.  If people and governments stopped borrowing money and paper clones,  the debt doesn't grow, the money supply shrinks and the system falters.  It truly is bizarre, but we all live in this system each and every day.  The Federal Reserve and other central banks control money by adjusting its supply  and how much it costs to borrow money, otherwise known as the interest rate.  With these tools and as a consequence of human group psychology,  central banks create booms and busts in the economy at will  and also to stall and derail an economy by messing with it.  Let's take a quick case study.  In the year 2000, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cut interest rates to 1%.  He did this to try and fight off the recession from the dot-com bubble  and encourage people to borrow money.  When interest rates are low, if you're borrowing money you save a whole lot on repaying mortgages.  Since the 1% interest rate hadn't been seen at the time since the 1950s it was a pretty good deal.  Greenspan's idea was that he could create a wealth effect.  People would start to buy houses, the prices would go up and the people would feel wealthier  and spend more money in the economy and stimulated.  Greenspan's sure succeeded in getting people to borrow money to buy houses.  But they borrowed too much and the results was the 2008 housing bubble.  This is a prime example of what can go wrong when central banks mess with an economy.  Yes, corrupt bankers have a lot to answer for on their role in the 2008 crisis.  But the Fed has a far bigger long-term impact.  Even crazier things are happening in Japan.  Their central bank is buying so many stocks  that they were the number one buyer of Japanese stocks in 2016  so they have part ownership of companies with money that they created from nothing.  So, in essence, it is the central banks that control our economy  and the central and commercial banking system together that control all of our money.  The difference is central banks can create money at will while commercial banks need loans to create money.  To give you an idea of people's views of central banking when people actually knew what central banks were,  here's a couple of examples.  In 1881 then, President of the United States, James Garfield states:  ""Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce  and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another,  by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.""  Benjamin Franklin, in his autobiography, stated that the prime reason for the American War of Independence  was a battle over who actually controlled and issued the money of the new colonies.  Moving on to more modern times, Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman states:  ""The Federal Reserve definitely caused The Great Depression  by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933.""  So, with all this being said, some would argue that central banks are not inherently a bad thing.  They just need to be part of the government and not privately-owned.  The government should be able to issue its own money for the benefit of the people and shouldn't have to pay  a massive interest on its own debt.  This was tried at least once in the United States by President Lincoln.  He stated this:  ""The government should create, issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed  to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers.  By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest.  Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity.""  Abraham Lincoln then issued his own government money.  It was called ""the greenback"".  No further comments on that story.  So I think we'll end the video there.  There's so much more that I could cover about what central banking decisions led  to what revolutions around the world.  Pretty much when you look at it, all revolutions and all wars, when you dig through everything,  it all boils down to money.  I could also have talked about the new global movement of those who are rejecting  the debt based economic system.  People are starting to move their currency into gold, silver and crypto-currencies like Bitcoin.  So there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  That's a whole nother story for another day.  Anyways, if you've watched the whole way through this video, congratulations!  You're one of the few who have found out the hidden truths about who controls all of our money.  I think I've only met about four people in real life that have been aware of the debt-based economic system.  It's strangely unknown, but it's as true as anything.  I haven't showed you all the quotes of the bankers and the former heads of the Federal Reserve telling you  from their own mouths how the system actually works.  If this is your first time hearing all of this, I encourage you, as I said before, to do your own research  and then you'll start to see the bigger picture and the world today will make a whole lot more sense.  If you want some good starting resources, I recommend Mike Maloney's ""Hidden Secrets of Money"" series.  It's here on YouTube and I'll leave a link below.  Mike is a very knowledgeable guy and I've had some great long conversations with him about the economy.  If you're into reading and you want to know more about the history of the Federal Reserve,  I recommend the book by G. Edward Griffin, ""The Creature From Jekyll Island"".  So anyway, I think I'll stop talking now.  Thanks for watching this video!  It's a been too go go(?)  You've been watching ColdFusion.  Feel free to subscribe to this channel if you're new. This isn't the stuff I normally make, but  I think you'll like the other stuff anyway.  I really hope you learned something from this video and I'll see you again soon for the next video.  Cheers guys, have a good one! ",2
DyV0OfU3-FU,"Your true wealth is your time and freedom. Money is just a tool for trading your time.  It's a container to store your economic energy until you're ready to deploy it.  But the whole world has been turned away from real money and has been fooled into using currency, -  a deceiptful imposter that is silently stealing your two most valuable assets.  Your time and your freedom. Welcome to the rabbit hole.  We are entering a period of financial crisis that is the greatest the world has ever known.  The wealth transfer that will take place during this decade is the greatest wealth transfer in history.  Wealth is never destroyed. It is merely transferred.  And that means that on the opposite side of every crisis there is an opportunity.  The great news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into your great opportunity is to educate yourself.  I believe that the best investment that you can make in your lifetime is your own education.  Education on the history of money.  Education on finance. Education on how the global economy works.  Education on how all of these guys, the central bankers, the stock market, how they can cheat you. How they can scam you.  If you learn what is going on and how the financial world works, you can put yourself on the correct side of this wealth transfer.  Winston Churchill once said that the further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future.  This program is all about creating your own crystal ball.  Being able to gaze into the future.  Being able to change this crisis, the greatest crisis in the history of mankind, into your great opportunity.  The hidden secrets of money. Some of them are hidden in plain sight.  They're like right in front of you.  Uh, the way the monetary system works is something that isn't actually hidden away from all of us.  It's out in the open, but it's complex and people just don't, they can't see how it works.  It's hard for them to imagine that we're living in such a hoax.  Others are meant to be secret, but the truth is slowly coming out.  Like the Federal Reserve being a private corporation and not really part of the U.S. Government.  But when I started studying this, uh, what I found was that there was no place that I could point people to where they could get it all in one spot.  And so I basically decided to write my book about it and consolidate monetary history, economics, the markets, uh, the fundamentals of gold and silver.  There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in economics, and I've sort of made it my job to lift the fog for people.  Welcome to Egypt. This is where it all began.  Roughly 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians started using gold and silver as their predominant form of currency,-  but it was not yet money.  The pieces of gold and silver that they were using were odd sizes and weights. Odd purities.  So it still was not interchangable where each unit is the same as the next. This meant that nothing really had a price yet.  You couldn't put a price of so many coins on something because they didn't have coins yet. Trade was still difficult.  It was still a guessing game when it came to the exchange of values.  One of the reasons that we are in the financial mess that we are today globally is that people do not understand the difference between currency and money.  Currency is a medium of exchange, a unit of account. It is portable, durable, divisible, and something called fungible.  Fungible means that each unit is the same as the next unit.  A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.  Money is all of those things plus a store of value over a long period of time.  Even financial planners, bankers, your accountant, they don't understand the difference between currency and money.  The currency in your pocket is a medium of exchange. It's a unit of account because it's got numbers on it.  It's somewhat durable, it's portable, it's divisible in that you can make change, and it's fungible.  A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.  But because governments can print more and more and more of it and dilute the currency supply,-  it's continually transferring wealth out of your pocket, out of your bank account to the government and to the banking system.  The reason that gold and silver are the optimum form of money is because of their properties.  It's an easy medium of exchange because gold and silver store a large amount of value in a very small area.  It's a unit of account. Pure gold has the same value all over the planet.  So an ounce of gold buys the same amount here in Egypt as it would in China or in the United States.  It's durable. The same gold that Egyptians were using in trade 5,000 years ago is still here with us today.  It does not corrode. It's divisible.  You can make change with it. It's very portable.  You can use something like oil as money. It's just that you can't carry around a barrel of oil on your back.  It's fungible. Pure gold is the same wherever it is on earth.  Pure silver is the same wherever it is on earth. It's limited in quantity.  That's the reason that it maintains its purchasing power. Governments cannot print it.  Over the last 5,000 years, only gold and silver have maintained their purchasing power.  There have been thousands upon thousands of fiat currencies.  Currencies that are unbacked by gold or silver, and they have all gone to zero. It's a 100 percent failure rate.  Well, fiat currency, of course, is um, a currency that is, exists at the dictate or by fiat from, from a government.  They have their printing presses, and the paper money rolls off the printing presses.  And then they give it the fiat designation which then makes the currency official.  It's just worthless paper, but when Ben Bernake gives it the special sign, and they have the cult meeting -  at the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, it suddenly becomes currency.  If you look at what's really going on it's, it's a con game. And so there's confidence.  Well, the Federal Reserve is very forthright about what they're doing.  If you read their website they'll tell you it's a confidence game.  They tell that there's no intrinsic value in their money.  They'll tell you that they print it backed by absolutely nothing.  They actually display all these facts.  But if you tell somebody in the public that this stuff is created out of thin air, there's no backing whatsover -  , it's absolutely worthless, it's about as valuable as Monopoly money, they'll look at you like you're nuts.  Is there an example throughout history of a fiat currency, a piece of paper that's unbacked by anything, surviving?  Short answer, no.  Long answer, no. And here's why.  When Addison Wiggin took over at The Daily Reckoning, they got cranked up.  Uh, Bill Bonner asked him to catalogue all of the fiat currencies throughout history and what happened to each of them.  Addison dutifully went to work. Within a short period of time he had gone through the alphabet. All the fiat currencies that started with the letter A were done.  They all went to zero. He was halfway through the letter B and all the fiat currencies that started with the letter B,-  and there were 600 of them in just the first letter and a half of the alphabet.  And every single one of them went to zero. Every one.  600 fiat currencies that start with the letter A, and half of the ones that start with the letter B, there are 600 of these things.  Not one ever came close.  And you think this one, the United States dollar is gonna be the first one after all that? I don't think so.  No. No currency, fiat currency has ever survived.  None.  The thing about money is there actually is a fairly well accepted definition of what money is.  The question is as you apply that definition to particular things that are, people claim to be money, do they fit the definition?  Well just take the paper dollar for example. How well does it perform those functions?  Will it store a value? Uh, the dollar has lost 95 percent of its purchasing power, uh, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.  So not very good as a store of value.  One of the things I do is, uh, just a way to get the audience's attention is I have a slide and there are three pictures on the slide.  One is a pile of Monopoly money. The other one is a pile of Federal Reserve notes.  Uh, what Americans would call paper money.  Uh, the other one is a solid gold, uh, American Eagle, uh, one ounce coin.  And the title of this slide is which of these is not like the other.  And if you know the show Sesame Street or if you have children who watch it, it's one of the favorite vignettes in Sesame Street.  And what it really is is a kind of IQ test for five year olds.  They're supposed to look at the three things and look at characteristics and find the one that's not like the other.  Well, I've shown this slide to, um, groups of, you know, Ivy League university professors, and I've also shown it to, uh, you know, uh, children.  You know, kind of find results in my nieces and newphews and so forth.  Uh, and when the, uh, professors look at it they say well, um, clearly the, uh, the dollars are not like the others -  'cause gold has no role as money and Monopoly money is junk and the American dollar is a store of value.  So that's not like the other. But the children look at it and they say well, the gold coin is not like the other -  because the other two are just piles of paper, and the gold coin is clearly something different.  So my question to the audience is who's smarter? A five year old or an Ivy League professor?  Before World War I, each note that a treasury issued would say that there has been deposited with the United States Treasury -  20 dollars in gold coin payable to the bearer upon demand.  The money was in the vault. The currency was a note they gave you that was a claim check.  Only a claim check on the money. The same as if you go to the dry cleaners and you give them your shirt and they give you a claim check for your shirt.  The value is, is that shirt at the dry cleaners. Not the piece of paper that says that you own that shirt.  So our currency that's circulated was the paper U.S. dollars and they were claim checks on money.  The next hidden secret is the difference between currency and money.  Money must be a store of value and maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time.  As we progress through this series, you'll learn that national currencies are really a tool used by the government -  and the financial sector to leach away your time and your freedom by stealing your purchasing power.  So rather than storing your economic energy, currencies leak.  Now compare that to the gold and silver the Egyptians were using. Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.  Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.  But they were on the right track as gold and silver have proven over thousands of years to be the ultimate store of value.  Gold is only formed when a star explodes, a supernova. And it stays around forever.  This is one of the properties that make it the ultimate money.  You know, people are amazed that after 5,000 years the pyramids are still here.  But what I'm more amazed at is that the currency that the people that built this were using,-  that currency, that gold and silver that they were using in trade on a daily basis, is still around today.  It may have been melted down and re-refined and it's in a coin or a bar or in some piece of jewelry.  But it's still with us today and it still purchases something.  Yes, it is the ultimate money because there is nothing else even in the same league. It's divisible.  It's permanent. It's a store of value.  It's, uh, a unit of account. It's got everything you want out of money, but it doesn't go away and it can't be increased.  That is what makes gold the most beautiful money of all. What more can you ask out of a money?  It keeps governments under control. You can maintain a solvent system.  Governments don't like gold at present because they're getting away with the fiat currencies, and they'll do everything they can to discredit it as an asset class.  I mean, my goodness. Gold has, uh, outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in each of the last seven years.  Uh, yet it's not considered a legitimate asset class. Why?  Again, it's the fear that maybe gold will be imposed on the system.  That it will constrain government ability to spend beyond its means.  They can't print it.  They can't print it, no.  The proper definition of inflation, I use Milton Friedman's definition. Inflation is an expansion of the currency supply.  Deflation is a contraction of the currency supply. If you expand the currency supply, eventually prices will rise.  And if you contract the currency supply, eventually prices will fall.  This is a pool. But it's not a pool of water.  This is a, the currency pool. And these are prices.  And if you expand the currency supply, prices like a sponge in water have to rise to suck up the excess currency.  Governments never stop printing more currency and adding currency to circulation.  Therefore, prices keep on going up. Not because they stuff that you're trying to buy is changing.  The real estate doesn't change. What has changed is the currency purchases less and less.  It's the currency going down. Not prices going up.  The truth is, what we have that makes our world work right now is a big story. None of it's real.  It's all just promises. And if you think about it, that's how currency began to work in the beginning.  You know, before we had currency we had barter.  I'll give you three coconuts and you give me four fish 'cause that's kind of a fair exchange on coconuts and fish.  But that got complicated so we had to invent this thing called money to be a divisible, portable medium of exchange.  And the challenge is that we've lost that a long time ago. We lost having things of value be our currency.  And now we have this thing called numbers and accounts. But trust me.  It is not real. It's a big made up story.  One of the biggest make believe stories ever is called quantitative easing which sounds complex, -  but it's really just a smoke and mirrors term for currency creation.  QE started with the banking bailouts back in 2009.  This currency was created out of thin air and then given to the banks who paid themselves record bonuses in reward for crashing the world economy.  This is a global phenomenon, but all you have to remember for now is that whether it's QE, bailouts, or stimulus programs, -  these are all just voodoo, hocus pocus terms for increased currency creation.  I believe gold and silver will reassert themselves as money and when they do, there just isn't enough.  And their purchasing power is going to go up many, many, many times.  Egypt is an amazing place. There's a franticness about it, an utter chaos. Especially like the traffic.  When it comes to like all of the merchants that are trying to get every last dime out of you, -  you get fleeced to the point where you come back with an empty wallet. [LAUGH]  But you know what? They're amateurs compared to Wall Street.  In the past several years, I've, I've spoken in many countries about the crisis that's coming, -  and a lot of people think that they're gonna be okay in their country.  That it's only gonna happen in the United States or maybe the United States and Europe.  Uh, but what they don't realize is that this is a global phenomenon.  I got to show you something here. This is, uh, base currency in the United States.  This is the number of paper dollars that exist basically.  It took 200 years to go from no dollars in existence to 825 billion.  And then we had the bailouts, and then we had QE1, Quantitative Easing 1.  Then QE2. And then we had QE3 and then QE4 and then soon we're gonna have QE57 and QE382. [LAUGH]  And, uh, it isn't just here. This is what the Canadian currency supply looks like.  This is Australia. South Africa. Russia.  Now this starts out in just the year 2001, and this is like 18 times more currency in existence in a little over a decade.  Uh, here's Singapore. Same story. Look at that. Since the crisis, just bam.  India. China. Every government on the planet is -  doing this insane deficit spending and expanding their currency supplies, uh, doing bailouts.  And history shows that there is no example of this turning out well.  It is sometimes amazing that we haven't experienced more inflation than we have.  If they keep expanding the money supply so vastly, why aren't our prices growing faster than they really are?  And the answer is that a good chunk of the money that the Fed created has been shipped overseas.  Uh, I remember early in my research I heard this expression that the Americans have exported their inflation.  I thought what is that? How can you export your inflation? Put it in a box and send it out? What do you do?  Well now I understand. You export your inflation by simply sending all these dollars that you created to these other countries -  and then they send you their refrigerators and their cars and whatever, their TV sets.  So you get hardware and they get little pieces of paper. It's a great deal for the American people for a while. For a while.  Sooner or later all of those pigeons come home to roost.  When the time comes as it looks like it's now coming, when the rest of the world is saying nuh-uh we don't want to play this game anymore.  Uncle Sam's dollars are just becoming worthless. There are too many of them.  We've got to find something else other than American dollars. Then those dollars start to come back to America.  People, we don't want them anymore. What do we do with them?  Once this revs up and we've got this, this little trickle of money coming back that we'd previously exported, -  when, once it becomes a flood and it starts to rush back, now we are getting our former exported inflation brought back to us.  And then we'll see the quantity of money inside the United States grow much more rapidly -  even than the Federal Reserve can create it because we're getting our previous money back.  And, uh, that's when we will really see the tanking of the U.S. Dollar in terms of what it will buy.  During the second round of quantitative easing, global food prices went up 60 percent, -  and this created a humanitarian disaster for the two billion people on earth who live on less than two dollars a day.  These people were hungry to start with. They became hungrier and some of them started overthrowing their governments in North Africa and around the Middle East.  So quantitative easing was the spark that ignited the Arab Spring.  So that's, that's it. When you create money, you get some sort of inflation.  It just depends on where the inflation goes.  Given the premise that you have a permanent underclass or poor class and how does inflation affect them disproportionately,  um, it affects them basically in the percentage of their income that goes to food.  And we see this as a ratio, and we know that there are some danger points.  For example in Egypt recently, once that ratio got to 40 percent of income going to food -  and the price of food rising due to inflation, when it got to 40 percent that's, uh, historically a point where people actually stage a revolution.  That's exactly what we saw. The French Revolution similarly was all around the price of food getting to a certain critical point where people simply, the risk-reward for revolution was favorable toward revolution.  Well, exactly right because when you have a runaway inflation, it's punishing the very people who are most productive in society.  In other words the people that produce more than they consume and save the difference.  The problem is is that those productive people, the savers, save in their national currency -  and unfortunately the national currency is just a fiat piece of paper at this point.  So when it's destroyed through runaway inflation, that 100,000 dollars that you were hoping to retire on doesn't exist.  And the things that you were gonna buy with it and provide for others don't exist either. Now what are you gonna do?  So that all seems pretty scary. However, uh, you know, this is going to happen and you can only play the hand that you're dealt.  But the great news is that gold and silver always end up doing an accounting of the expansion of the currency supplies.  Basically the will of the public and the free markets.  When governments do this kind of stuff to their currency supply, they debase it, eventually it comes back in inflation.  People sense the loss of their puchasing power. They rush back to gold and silver and they bid the value of -  the gold and silver up in the country until it meets or exceeds the value of all the currency in circulation.  This is a process that's been going on over and over again throughout history except this time it's happening on a global scale.  It has never before happened in all countries at once.  And that means that this is the greatest wealth transfer in history.  Therefore it's the greatest opportunity in history and it's not gonna happen again in your lifetime.  So now we've learned that your true wealth is your time and your freedom.  Money is a trading tool that stores the economic energy that is your time and freedom whereas currencies leak them away.  Gold and silver are the ultimate money simply because of their properties.  Fiat currencies are based solely on confidence and always return to their intrinsic value of zero.  Governments don't like gold because it imposes restraint. Rising prices are a symptom of an expanding currency supply -  and gold and silver always acocunt for an expanding currency supply.  So that's it for this episode. Join me next time as we begin to investigate how monetary history just repeats and repeats -  and how gold and silver always win the battle between currency and money.  Until then, my challenge to you is to stop calling currency money. It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.

b0zKx5r7W4o,"if you've ever been involved in  Freemasonry or rather Dan Brown books  and you've probably heard about the  Illuminati Illuminati the Illuminati  were a secret society dedicated to  scientific truth the Catholic Church  ordered a brutal massacre assignments  them forever some believe that this  organization is still around today and  that they might be behind critical world  events and are even creating some kind  of new world order so when I got a  follow invite from some Illuminati  recruiter on Instagram I knew I needed  to join so I asked he said are you sure  you want to get on with this there is no  turning back  all right what did I just stumble into I  said yes good before we proceed what do  you understand about what we are as a  body and I really didn't know what to  say  so I googled the word Illuminati for a  definition and it read a sect of 16th  century Spanish heretics who claimed  special religious enlightenment and I  copied and pasted it and sent it to him  then he said I see so then he goes on to  tell me that I will need to be  enlightened by a Grand Master who will  help perform my initiation what is he  gonna have me do then he gives me the  Grand Master's phone number and tells me  to contact him on whatsapp he says no  video calls because their identity must  be kept secret until I become a full  member so I did what he asked I messaged  the Grand Master on whatsapp saying what  the recruiter told me to say hail  Illuminati and he responded and he said  hello who are you and who sent you to me  so I sent him a screenshot of the  profile of the recruiter that had been  talking to ok it would be confirmed in  two hours time of the temple then I  would get back with you and I said what  will be confirmed whether you can join  or not see you then  ok so what does he mean they don't know  anything about me what are they gonna  vote on but two hours does go by and he  writes back hello there I said hello he  said I've confirmed everything  we can now proceed in your membership  into the Illuminati Brotherhood so I  guess they voted to let me in he then  goes over the Illuminati guide one don't  accept anything from strangers claiming  to be Illuminati  you must always be truthful to me always  to always wish your neighbor success 3  if anyone asks you to join the  Illuminati society again as from now  expect my names mentioned black that  person immediately don't talk to him or  her for it anything you want to do  grandmaster know about it 5 dunno speak  to anyone about the Illuminati except  your me as from now expect my name is  indicated at the peak of the  conversation made the all-seeing eye  guide you alright what is this I don't  even know this guy's name so I said  what's your name he said a good question  you have asked which I wanted to write  my names are Alex David sent ok so he  has three names he said now you know my  name what's yours  and I said Benjamin Dover  nice to meet you Dover hope you don't  mind me calling you that I said no  problem warning warning warning to all  new members who are ready to join the  great Illuminati Brotherhood one on no  account must you disrespect the  Brotherhood too you must learn to come  online regularly 3 you must not promise  and fail about anything before you must  learn to give 5 you must be about the  age of 18 years before you can join the  enlightened organisation Illuminati 6 if  anyone asks you to join the Illuminati  apart from me your Grandmaster and the  name been indicated as to interact like  you were told don't listen to that  person or we still report that person to  me and block immediately after my  conclusion on it  7 on no account must you uninstall your  whatsapp Heil the Illuminati 666 okay  what's next  he said these are what you must do to  join us successful one you must agree to  follow two you are to trust and obey  three you are to give the right  Meishan about you blah blah blah so many  rules and lastly you are not to delay  when it's time for initiation if you can  do all the above you can be trusted and  initiated so do you accept I said yes  the Illuminati is an elite organization  of world leaders business authorities  and other influential members of this  planet our collective unites influencer  of the world in an unrestrictive and  private remain free of political  religious and geographical boundaries to  further the prosperity of the human  species as a whole while our operation  require anonymity for the safety of our  members do you get this I'm like yes  I've seen both national treasure movies  he said we were bringers of wealth  happiness and holy crap just let me in  already I said this is what I desire he  said and you would get it can we proceed  to the next step now please here are the  rules of the Illuminati Brotherhood oh  my gosh how many rules are there they're  basically the same as the hundred other  rules that he's already listed except  for number 10 which says henceforth you  will address me as father or Grandmaster  and I would address you as my child so  do you accept all this rules and  regulations yes Grandmaster  yes son can we proceed to the next step  now then he gives me a form to fill out  I put a bunch of bogus info and he asks  for a picture ID but there's no way I'm  gonna send that but he says ok son you  got a driving licence  I'm not going to give him my license so  I try my hand at Photoshop I find a  sample license online I try to make it  look real  [Music]  [Music]  not bad if I say so myself then I sent  it to him he said okay I'm going to get  back to you some minutes time I would  have to input these details into the  Illuminati database and get back to you  in it was successful or not  I pray registration would be son all  right so now I wait is he going to  notice that it's fake or is he just  going to let me proceed with the  initiation he wrote back and he said  your details have been received in your  registration successful but you won't be  able to enjoy our benefits until you  become a full member and before you can  become a full member you will need to  pass through the initiation program no  blood sacrifices needed or death of a  loved one once you make your mind to  proceed there is no going back so would  you like to proceed all right it's time  for the initiation I got to tell you I'm  starting to get a little freaked out he  tells me that I need to obtain some  items that will be used for the  sacrifice and it gives me a whole list  of things like a lamb and mustard seeds  a red Cola with five faces and the heart  of an eagle where in the world am I  gonna get the heart of an eagle  he said note in the second thought you  must know that all this material is  available in our temple are you getting  everything I'm saying son oh okay so I  guess you can just get all this stuff in  the temple so I say where's the temple  he said you haven't become a member yet  so you can't get to the temple until you  are a member son okay so how am I gonna  get these items that's when he tells me  that I can obtain them by sending $1,075  through Western Union and I'm like okay  so I don't travel through the temple he  said it would be a spiritual travel so  I'm not going in person he said I told  you earlier you aren't going in person  until you become a member you are going  to be connected spiritually oh okay so  I'm gonna be like 11 on stranger things  and participate that way telepathically  I said I understand father  okay so let's proceed with the payment  okay he said you have to head to a  Western Union now son  okay anytime someone brings up Western  Union my scam alert goes off so I'm not  gonna send money this guy but I need to  find out what's really going on so I ask  him where he lives  and he says New York then I ask if we  can speak on the phone and he says you  haven't become a member  why do you want us to speak on the phone  and I'm like I just want to speak to the  people that I send money to he says I'm  not a people well then what is he  I'm your Grand Master and member of the  Illuminati you can't speak on phone with  me I'm at the temple and non-member  can't speak with me all right I want to  believe this guy but something tells me  he's not really in New York but there's  one way to find out so I go to money  Graham's web site and I copy the URL  then I create a redirect link with grab  a fight to snag his IP info if I can get  him to click on it so I set him the link  and I ask if this is a money service  that I can use he says nope you have to  get there in person all right success  the grandmaster clicked on my link and  now I know where his IP address is  originating from it's coming from watch  he really is in New York so I take a  closer look at his ISP and says total  server solutions LLC and a little Google  search shows me this is a high  performance cloud and dedicated hosting  service this means he's likely using a  VPN to hide his actual location the  scammers smarter than the average bear  but I reached out to the team at grab a  fight for help and they told me to turn  on the smart logger and that this will  give me a lot more information including  the time zone of the Grand Master so now  I've got to do it again I've got to  create another link for him to click on  and then I'll know what time zone is in  so I got a new URL for the nearest  Western Union location when I turned on  the smart logger and I said please  confirm this  we'll accept payment the Grand Master  said I don't want you to make the  payment online I told you this son  you've got to get there in person and  I'm like no this is the website for the  location that you're referring to  can you just click on it and confirm if  that's the correct address he said son  do you know Walgreens and I'm like yes  that's where this Western Union is but  please look at that website  he said head to Walgreens dang it  he's not clicking on it but that's when  I came up with another plan I wrote him  and I said heading there now I might be  like Robert Langdon and how smart the  Illuminati I tell them that my phone is  running out of battery and that I need  the wiring instructions now he says  aren't you with your charger I said if  you give me the name and the receiver  details I should be fine so he sends the  info and tells me to find a charger the  Walgreens and send photos of the payment  receipt but then I go quiet pretending  that the phone died and I leave him on  pins and needles because the only thing  that's standing between him and his cash  is that receipt then I come back ten  minutes later and I tell him that I've  completed my task but my phone is dead  and I tell that I'm on my computer and I  can't take a picture of the receipt with  my phone but I'll do it with my laptop's  camera and upload it to imager so I send  him a grab a file Inc that redirects him  to an image of a receipt of what I had  for lunch that day and that's when I was  able to get the timestamp for where he  was he says I can't find a photo there  send me the MT CN number that's when I  say why are you up so late  it's 1:25 a.m. in Nigeria right now he  says I'm not in Nigeria the agent is the  one in Nigeria I'm in New York I told  you that earlier I said no you are  you're using an infinite hot five  smartphone that's the agent I guess not  me what are you trying to say that I'm  lying here I say okay let's do a video  chat so you can show me that you're  really in New York if you're really in  New York the Sun will still be up like  seriously you really  playing on my intelligence now I told  you that you couldn't make a call with  me till you're a member then you want to  get on video chats this poor guy he went  through all that time researching the  history of the Illuminati and trying to  organize his dumb ritual I actually kind  of felt bad I said I can't send you  $1,000 but I would like to buy you  dinner for your time today  he said okay and how much dinner are you  buying me I'm like one meal is what I  can afford  he said okay you want to do this with me  homeboy and after that he stopped  talking to me and he actually ended up  blocking me I guess he wasn't hungry  [Music]  [Music] ",2
CKlM82LJfTI,"Music]  be quiet Shh cover your farts can throw  them away Shh new face fuck it Connie  alright Mark Zuckerberg also as I like  to call him Santa Claus because he knows  if you've been

shit he's company  sold data to another company that like  helped Donald Trump get elected blah  blah blah threat to our way of life blah  blah blah privacy is dead blah blah blah  the meme forever has been that he is  some sort of robot lizard man that is  part of the Illuminati are the  allegations true that you're secretly a  lizard and let me tell you this whole  thing was the goddamn gold mine  specifically with regard to the process  by which Cambridge analytic I was able  to purchase that guy isn't human there's  no way that that came from a female like  that did not come from a female human  that was laid in an egg so there's a  subreddit dedicated to Mark Zuckerberg  memes about how awkward he is and all  the stupid awkward crap he's done so  let's have a look for this episode of  weird sub reddits rocky just just the  way he goes from a human emotion back to  absolute dead face that man is computer  program I forget the egg he was made  with software just a picture

a  second my biggest problem with this  whole like let's investigate Facebook  thing none of the people investigating  him know what the fuck they're talking  about none of them understand Facebook  none of them have ever sent a dick pic  this man just asked how they make money  ads you absolute dumbass oh my god look  at him staring down oh it's like the  internal programming is telling him he  has to smile and laugh and then it's  creepy as shit  delete Facebook deleting this app will  also delete its data text from Mark  Zuckerberg hey stop he's not gonna let  you go without a fight  Zuckerberg loses contact lens during  Senate hearing revealing horrifying  lizard eye his eye does look so lizardy  someone's just photoshopped mark  zuckerberg with a big old booty goddamn  goddamn that's a sick boy right now  I may now be attracted to Mark  Zuckerberg do I have a thing for lizards  I guess I do  Mark Zuckerberg is taking classes with  behavioral psychologists to appear more  human after wave of internet memes  portray him as robotic or alien that is  hashtag confirmed he is a lizard alien  robot if you don't know how to be human  you clearly weren't born human my  favorite is this account that pretends  to be Zuckerberg and it comes up with  like really elaborate weird stories it's  just a picture of him holding I'm  guessing his baby this child give it to  me he said the women squinted her eyes  ever so slightly like she didn't  understand what I was saying I said give  me the child she pulled her baby closer  pressing  nurse call button by her side ahaha I  saw that what do you think a nurse is  going to do tell me to leave call  security  don't make me laugh I snapped my fingers  the very same nurse on duty to tend to  this woman marched in wrenching the baby  from her mother's arms the woman  screamed she cried she pleaded with me  as I took her child in my arms and  strolled out of the hospital nonetheless  today is a joyous day I am now a father  it's the world through Mark Zuckerberg  voice as a god-king robot man if he  wants to become a father what do you  think he does impregnate a woman robots  can't impregnate women he walks into a  hospital he buyers a child he just buys  it and takes what he wants I am NOT a  robot sweating intensifies the suck is  fucked what everyone else sees Mark  Zuckerberg sitting in chair what he sees  processing data she's gonna that's a  high threat level okay look at this  picture tell me that's not a fucking  lizard just tell me that's a lizard like  I know it's all banter he's just  slightly awkward let's make fun of him  that's a fucking lizard Zuckerberg legs  bend forward instead of back the  reptilians made a mistake when  assembling him I'll go Danny all right  I've never thought about how my leg  bends before I don't think that's right  this there's something wrong with him  I'm starting to buy into the conspiracy  you may actually be a lizard robot Queen  mark I realize you're watching this  video oh not not through YouTube you can  watch me in many other ways see he's  actually listening to me through my  fridge that's it that's a big hey listen  to you through your fridge mark like I  just want to apologize I don't want to  be eaten there's no nutrients here why  can't I find a guy like this ugh hey no  I'm literally the Chi in women just  don't know what they want look at this  cute lizard we found in the street today  new face filters on Instagram today this  is my favorite one so far nice job team  literally him as The Terminator see what  I mean I can't decide lizard or robot  man let me know in the comments what do  you think is your lizard or a robot Man  Mark Zuckerberg notes from testifying  before Congress zero one zero zero zero  one one zero zero  look just cuz he can read binary doesn't  mean he's a robot okay it does when  you're on Facebook and you forget to put  tape over your webcam oh hi mark  yeah so people are worried about like  Facebook or the FBI watching them  through their webcam or a hacker  secretly recording them I don't know why  you're worried like they could watch me  through my phone as I'm taking a shit so  they're the ones that have to watch a  grown man take a shit I don't have to  I'm just looking at some memes they're  the ones what should me take a shit who  do you feel sorry for I've just never  I'm never really seen why people care  like I guess it's an invasion of privacy  but that's gone anyway you're not  there's nothing private the government  Facebook Twitter they're all watching  you there's no privacy is dead so just  embrace it just occasionally just like  wink at the camera I say hi I talked to  him I asked him about their day I've  never had a response back but at least  they know I care so one final clip  here's a senator asking he's getting mad  burn on Mark Zuckerberg mr. Zuckerberg  would you be comfortable sharing with us  the name of the hotel you stayed in last  night no  if you've messaged anybody this week  would you share with us the names of the  people you've message a senator no I  would probably not choose to do that  publicly here I think that maybe what  this is all about ha you get it cuz  Facebook steals all your private  information but he won't share his  private information you know what's not  funny about that the government spies on  you more than anyone yes speaking of  spying you remember this guy he's seen  your penis send it to Orrin Hatch from  Utah he's seen you dick he's definitely  saying you dick  this lady let me tell you how she's got  a crush she's seen you dick hell this  guy's looking at it right now he's got a  live stream straight to your crotch yet  can tell by how confused this guy is  that he's seen your dick you know who do  they go to to get access for that  Facebook which is the stupid point of  this whole thing it's all a show they're  just doing it to try and make you feel  better it's the government trying to  make you feel like they're doing the  right thing like they're doing something  about your privacy being invaded but no  one does it more than the government  they've seen your penis they're all  freaking spying on you as well the  government can literally spy on you  through your smart TV that was a thing  so as I said just embrace it give him a  wink as you're on the toilet because  privacy is dead the government's not  doing nothing about it cuz they're the  worst at it I had to get that out I'm  sorry this whole thing just annoyed me  once again what we should take from it  is the memes because nothing else Matt's  Mark Zuckerberg is slightly awkward so  we should bully him for it all right  Bell to play lock button I hope you  enjoyed this episode of weird subreddit  Mark Zuckerberg edition I will show you  fellas later as always they're all  watching ",2
JxjLh4WKzFE,"[Music]  hi my angels its Haley Reis and today's  video is really exciting for me because  it is part two of my mini conspiracies  series that I've started here my second  last video we dope into the Illuminati I  will have it linked down below but for  today's video we are going to be diving  into reptilians now I am going to say  prior to diving deep into the conspiracy  theory of reptilians it kind of seemed  like a more or rather a less likely  conspiracy to be true but after digging  through all of the information and the  reasonings that people believe in these  reptilians it doesn't seem so  far-fetched after all especially in the  conspiracy world so I am really super  excited to bring you guys this  information and to just dive headfirst  into this particular theory much like  researching into the Illuminati I had  extreme difficulty in researching into  reptilians it was kind of the same  repetitiveness of finding something that  seems like a lead finding something that  seems like it's a statistic or factual  and then right next to it is a  contradicting article or a contradicting  documentary so I've done my absolute  best to dig through hours and hours and  hours of footage and pages and web  searches and bring you guys a condensed  version of the overall reptilian theory  so let's just get right on into it  because I have so much to share with you  guys and so much to talk about though we  have no time to waste so here we go so  I'm sure you've been exposed to theory  of reptilians at one point or another in  your lifetime more specifically I'm sure  you've seen those trending videos of  celebrities briefly showing their  reptilian form I think one of the more  popular videos was that of Justin Bieber  in court where his eyes appear to shift  to some sort of reptilian form and come  back when he kind of shakes out of the  trance I'm sure you guys have at some  we seen this footage but I will insert  the clip right here for those of you who  haven't but it's a very popular  reptilian expose video mr. beaver you  are charged with the following DUI  alcohol or drugs resisting without now I  am definitely by no means claiming that  anybody in this video such as Justin  Bieber is a reptilian I'm just bringing  them into it as part of the conspiracy  theory that reptilians are so that  footage is a little bit interesting to  me I have seen people attempting to  debunk that footage in particular and  claiming that it was nothing more than a  glitch in the camera or a glitch in the  pixels but the only thing that I find  contradicting of that and I find  interesting is the way that he shakes  his head and his eyes go back to normal  at that specific moment in time but let  me just tell you guys something that I  didn't realize that the conspiracy of  reptilians goes way deeper than any of  these celebrity expose of reptilians  videos now the theory that our world is  ran by these reptilian humanoids which  is essentially reptilians disguised as  humans gained popularity due to David  Icke now David Icke believes that the  world has ran by these shape-shifting  reptilians who have gained control by  taking human form but more specifically  taking positions in power specifically  again in politics but also just power in  general and that's kind of how they've  taken over the human race so to speak  it's said that these reptilians feed on  human energy and require human  sacrifices but more specifically they  feed on the energy of children David  believes that these reptilians are  turning the human race into a slave race  now I know this sounds insane and you  might be thinking to yourself oh that's  just the beliefs of one  but a study confirmed that around 13  million people believe that our world is  ran by these shape-shifting lizards and  these people also believe that they've  kind of taken over politics so I thought  to kind of start out this video rather  than diving specifically into what  exactly these reptilians are said to be  what they're said to do and the risks of  exposing them I figured we should begin  with who exactly David Icke is because  he kind of is the main conspiracy  theorist behind this whole entire theory  now David Icke actually didn't initially  spend his days as a conspiracy theorist  and didn't necessarily spend his days  trying to share an awakened people to  his theories he actually used to be a  sports broadcaster on TV but in 1990 he  had for what I've interpreted to be what  I can only refer to as a spiritual  awakening however shortly after this  David actually appeared on TV and  announced he was a son of God proceeding  with news that the world of the ending  and mass destruction would be hitting  such as tidal waves and earthquakes now  when his predictions did not come into  fruition he kind of became a  laughingstock and a lot of people  questioned his reputable 'ti and  definitely thought that he was full of  it but David would actually go on to  become a best-selling author and  eventually gain both the support and the  trust of many there are so many people  who currently believe David Ickes  theories now interestingly enough David  believes and I quote the universe is  made up by a vibrational energy and  consists of an infinite amount of  dimensions that share the same space and  from this he believes and once again I  quote an interdimensional race of  reptilian beings have shape shifted and  hijacked earth now as far as that goes I  do believe that the world has made up a  vibrational energy and I also believe  that it consists of an infinite  number of dimensions and I also believe  that within these dimensions there are  many of things so who's to say that  there aren't shape-shifting reptilians  in that dimension and also who's to say  that they haven't come to ours and  hijacked it moving on though these  reptilians are said to be around six to  seven feet tall  naturally and it's said that they  utilize this ultra high-tech futuristic  alien like technology to come to our  dimension but also to transport  themselves now these are Chileans occupy  positions of authority but authority all  across the board basically anybody  that's in a position to steer the  general public or us humans from the  actual truth no David believes this  includes Obama Queen Elizabeth and the  Clinton family and more even dating back  to ancient times but like I said that is  just David's theory now it's believed by  those in favor of this conspiracy theory  that shape-shifting is a very very real  thing as our reptilians and that the  mainstream media is slowly trying to  ease us into it with movies and shows  that kind of showcase these types of  beings or shape-shifting or things of  this nature conspiracy theorists believe  that they're doing this that way you've  found any point in time it's exposed  that there are shape-shifting reptilians  among us we're not gonna be completely  foreign to the idea of shape-shifting  because we've seen it in mainstream  media now there are said to be two types  of reptilians in particular hybrid  reptilians and full reptilians hybrid  reptilians would be a mix between a  human being and a full reptilian so it's  a hybrid of both the human race and the  reptilian race now the full bred  reptilians are said to maintain control  over these hybrid reptilians who more  often than not don't even know they're  reptilian some believe that celebrities  in the mainstream media are actually  hybrid reptilians many of which who  don't actually know that they are so  this means that a normal person like you  or I unless you are actually I'm  watching this could meet a full  reptilian in a  humanoid shell and they could love each  other and have a baby that is now a  hybrid reptilian and that child will go  on to not to potentially never know that  they are a hybrid reptilian and people  believe that some celebrity is such as  singers or actresses or actors or things  like that could very well be these  hybrid reptilians about knowing and that  full reptilians remain or maintain sorry  control over them trying to keep any bit  of their bloodline in power and in the  position to steer and pull away people  from the actual truth of how our  universe is being ran or our world is  being ran now when David Icke was asked  if reptilians know that they were  reptilian he said and I quote some do  some don't most don't which is kind of  eerie and very interesting because if  you think about it any of us could be  reptilians perhaps the most interesting  theory where this theory is concerned  that I explored is that not just anybody  would be able to witness somebody  briefly shape-shifting in front of them  or be able to identify a shape-shifting  reptilian it's actually said within the  theory that those who are clairvoyant or  those who are psychic are more likely to  recognize a reptilian or to see a brief  shift in a reptilian firstly  shape-shifting is incredibly difficult  to control and for those who may or may  not know that they are hybrid reptilians  it's difficult for them to control in  general most brief switches in hybrid  reptilians or reptilians in general  occur in a moment of extreme emotion so  when a lot of anger comes on or a lot of  sadness comes on or just a lot of  emotion in general like in a high-stress  time or when they're going through an  anxiety attack anything of those sorts  it's more often at a time like that for  a unintentional shift to happen such as  your eye shifting which is why a lot of  people who believe in this theory  actually thought that well Justin Bieber  was in court whether or not he knows his  shapeshifter  perhaps the stress of being in court  kind of triggered this switch in his I  know conspiracy theorist in this theory  claim that most people wouldn't even  knives that switch in fact what they  would recognize if somebody who is a  hybrid reptilian or a full reptilian has  this switch in front of them they would  just recognize it as a switch of energy  or a switch of emotion but those  clairvoyant or psychic may actually  notice the human eye shift into that of  a reptilian very briefly even for a  second or see some sort of a change in  the person that they're around or  communicating with another theory that I  found really interesting and doing my  research is that not all those who have  those slips of the eye or slips of this  reptilian side coming through are  actually reptilians themselves as I  mentioned earlier reptilians actually  feed off of human energies so somebody  who could be unknowingly in a  relationship with or in a friendship  with or just around a reptilian may  actually have a moment where they kind  of have reptilians footjob due to the  reptilian feeding off and mixing with  their energies so let's say for an  example I'm in a relationship with a  reptilian and we're switching up energy  a lot and this reptilians kind of  feeding off of my energy and all of a  sudden I have a really high stress  moment but their energies and my energy  for a split moment my I might switch to  a reptilian eye even though I'm not a  reptilian hybrid or Chilean period which  I thought was a pretty fascinating  theory now those who strongly believe in  the theory actually claim that it's  almost dangerous to try to expose or  shed light on reptilians so this video  is awesome for me a man named Richard  Bruce actually uploaded reptilian  shapeshifters movies to YouTube back in  early 2013 now here's where it gets  really creepy immediately after  uploading his reptilian shape-shifting  movie 4 LAPD officers showed up at his  front door kind of pretending in his  words to inquire about the previous  tenant that lived there however in his  eyes it was made very obvious that they  were actually inquiring about him and  his reptilian movie he was then  continuously stopped by the LAPD because  he felt they wanted to make it very  clear to him that his uploads of these  reptilian shape-shifting movies would  come with concept  and I'm actually gonna link a link to  his personal video down below where he  spends a good I think it's just a little  over 20 minutes going over all of the  kind of stalking that happened and the  consequences of uploading his  shape-shifting movies so again this  video was gonna be awesome for me and I  mean David Icke also believes that  there's consequences to threatening to  expose or exposing those in the  shape-shifting government he actually  references Stanley Kubrick in his final  film Eyes Wide Shut no Stan Lee was as  David claims to be an exposure and he  wanted to expose this so very quickly  after Stanley presented Eyes Wide Shut  to the film company he passed away and  David claims that the ritual in the film  is actually a very very very mild  version of what takes place in some of  these reptilian rituals and that Stan  Lee wouldn't know because he was an  exposure and he knew all about it  interestingly enough after he passed  away they cut 25 minutes from the film  that we don't know what it was or what  it was exposing or what it was sharing  David also believes that reptilians  manipulate global events in order to  instill fear in the human race because  the reptilians feed and thrive off of  human fear I should also note that David  Icke believes that the moon is a  gigantic spacecraft and it's what they  utilized to manipulate the human race by  manipulating the human mind and blocking  and stopping us from seeing what we  otherwise would which would be the truth  of what's going on here on planet Earth  now the biggest reason that this is part  two to my Illuminati video is because  David Icke believes that the Illuminati  is reptilians and that it's kind of one  in the same and they're there one plan  as well as world domination there are so  many documentaries on reptilians there  are so many different theories and  conspiracy theories surrounding it this  is really truly just scraping the  surface on this particular theory and my  way of trying to condense all of the  information that I've accumulated into a  cohesive video where it's kind of an  overview of everything what I do  definitely definitely encourage you guys  to check out Richard's link down below  where he kind of explains the  consequences to putting out his movie  YouTube and I also encourage you guys if  this interests you to kind of look  through the internet because all of  these conspiracy theories as far as this  reptilian movement goes really believe  that they need to awaken everybody for  what the reality is and what's really  going on and that an awakening is  necessary before the human race is  entirely wiped out I also want to note  that I'm definitely not saying that the  world is ran by reptilians all I'm doing  is exploring this theory with an open  mind and sharing with you guys the  information that I've accumulated and  kind of built up but whether or not our  world is dominated by shape-shifting  reptilians I guess I will never know  unless I will and in which case that  might be a scary time well you guys that  is an overview of reptilians like I said  we have a part 3 video coming out in  this same field and ballfield  kind of exploring these theories I've  been really enjoying kind of switching  it up this past week and digging into  these theories but after our third part  I have more haunted content coming so  make sure you guys go ahead and click  that subscribe button if you've yet to  do so because we've got some crazy  thought-provoking ghostly conspiracy  just spooky

nzPIYHWTplk,"I'm something of the geek culture quiz  at hadurok I'm in all places at once  video games comics cult film wrestling  board games I'm a man of many lonely  lonely loves and of course what kind of  nerd would I be without loving Doctor  Who a concept driven sci-fi epic of a  mythological super-grip pottering around  space being clever and seeing  interesting things and most importantly  traveling through time time-travel is  great right being able to cut through  the accumulated lies of history to see  the truth of the past or you know being  a tourist in a strange world of the  future for years despite science saying  no stop it  you can't people have tried to prove  once and for all the time travel exists  the theories range from compelling to  stupid and are often both I'm Adam from  what culture calm and here at 10 bizarre  theories of proof time travel exists  number 10 the tiny watch let's start  weird in 2008 there was mass reporting  that during a Chinese archeological  expedition a 400 year old tomb of C King  from the Ming Dynasty which as most  people will know was an absolute lad of  a dynasty hongwu emperor hashtag squad  goals inside this believed to be  undisturbed house of dirt and dead fell  as the archaeologists found something  very strange a tiny gold watch time  frozen at six past ten with the word  Swiss engraved on the back the story  circulated the net like wildfire may  taking is proof that time travellers  visited us hundreds of years ago which  made it all the more of a shame that the  photos of sparks story in the first  place were digitally created hoaxes  number nine the mobily Jourdain incident  from tiny gold watches to two  middle-aged ladies dicking around in  eighteenth century Paris in 1901 the two  English academic Charlotte and Mobley  and Eleanor Jourdain who we can agree  our absolute biscuits visited Paris and  went looking for the Petit Trianon which  is part of the grounds of the Palace of  Versailles according to a book they  published recounting their experiences  the two women got lost and instead of  turning left turn right and ended up 120  years in the past they saw farmers in  smelly clothes an old farmhouse and also  hung out with cake enjoying underclass  dismissing Marie Antoinette because why  not chuckle every in there when the book  was first published it became a  best-seller held up as proof of time  steps but it was also heavily criticized  as being the nonsense work of fevered  hallucinatory  mine's number eight the Scottish time  slip while Mobley and Jourdain  accidentally stumbled into the past  Victor Goddard flew into the future like  the time-traveling ladies god I was a  smart cookie flying planes for the RAF  in World War one and World War two  reading engineering at Cambridge and  becoming director of intelligence at the  Air Ministry so a reliable mind then  well does a perception change when we  tell you he firmly believed all his life  that in 1935 he briefly flew into the  future yep in a plane so it's 1935 and  Goddard left drem airfield in her  Edinburgh to fly home then he ran into  trouble with the weather and lost his  bearing so he decided to fly back to  drem and start again fresh as he  approached the airfield this time the  rain around him turned into a bright  sunny day and below him he saw a newly  renovated airfield complete with men  rushing around in blue uniforms that  he'd never seen before and a bunch of  planes painted yellow he flew away  without landing and four years later the  Air Force changed all their uniforms to  blue and began painting now planes  yellow a moment of clairvoyance from  Goddard or like the ladies before him a  brief stumble into a different time or a  stroke also possible number seven the  Philadelphia Experiment the rule of  thumb is if it's stupid the American  military have tried to research it my  control psychic warfare warrior robots  and you can bet their last coin they've  had a go at time-travel well allegedly  the Philadelphia Experiment also known  by the delightful codename project  rainbow so a lot of disputed and  disreputable sources go was based around  Einstein's unified field theory which  very very very simply a pines if light  could be bent then so could space-time  we could render possible the idea of an  invisible time machine thing in 1943 as  part of project rainbow the Navy  allegedly made a ship the USS Eldridge  disappear by sending it ten seconds into  the past right number six the Montauk  Project well in for a stupid penny in  for a stupid pound this is another  conspiracy theory about the US  government experimenting with time  travel this time in a series of salty  secret projects in Montauk in Long  Island the theory was started by preston  nichols and america north who claims to  have unlocked repressed secret memories  in his own mind of his path in the  time-travel experiments that was somehow  brainwashed out of him he made a music  video about one of these experiments  which show him meeting himself in the  future and also  eating a lot of cheese while it's easy  to dismiss this as the delusions or lies  of one man  Nichols also claimed the government with  doing mind-control studies at Long  Island Air Force Base using psychotropic  drugs and that actually did happen with  project MKULTRA so who knows number five  the Hadron Collider you've heard of the  Large Hadron Collider right it's the  thing that scare mongering journeys have  been trying to convince you will destroy  the whole world using super quick atoms  or the collider or atom smashers we  prefer to call has been turned on a  bunch of times and rather than the world  ending they're discovered the parentally  elusive Higgs boson particle according  to one theory but forward by scientists  Tom Wheeler and tree man who I hope I  got your names right the Higgs bosons  could create another particle called the  Higgs singlet which is like a restless  singlet except not at all like that  the thing that would be able to jump  into a fifth dimension and move back and  forwards through time it's all theory  and when result in hoverboards any time  soon but still science number for the  iPhone footage one of the main things  that disproves time-travel is a notion  is that if the technology had been  invented in the future then someone  would have come to visit us by now  unless they've been doing it in secret  because of risks of paradoxes people  have been looking for evidence of these  secret time travelers for years and for  a time they found one in a  behind-the-scenes piece of footage  bundled with the DVD release of Charlie  Chaplin's the circus but it appears to  show a woman talking into a mobile phone  oh my G  Tim trivial confirms ed the internet and  then historians pointed out that maybe  she could have been listening to one of  these an early model of a hearing aid no  or she's a reptilian equal possibility  number three the Nicolas Cage theory no  less is complete without a cameo from  tenured professor of crazy a Hollywood  University Nicolas Cage here is a  picture of Nicolas Cage are the serene  lunacy hiding behind his eyes the  screaming skull under the skin and here  is a picture of an 1870 Tennessee  gentleman that was discovered in 2011  the resemblance is uncanny  what's more check out this artist's  rendering of maximilliana the first 19th  century Emperor of Mexico also caged now  people have called Nicolas Cage and uh  nading vampire but that's obviously not  true we've seen him age before our very  eyes now the only thing that makes sense  is that Nicolas Cage has been all  through time dammit he's the first time  traveler probably because  No he can afford it number two John  Titor now once the idea of secret time  travelers hit the Internet it was only a  matter well time before someone claimed  to be one step forward John title in the  relative the early days of internet  forums the early noughties stories of  John Titor began to do the rounds he was  a fellow from the Year 2036 told people  that the future America was broken into  five smaller regions each devastated by  nuclear war and that most of the world  powers were destroyed  he also helpfully provided plans of his  time machine I mean no one has  successfully made his time machine yet  and none of his predictions have come  true but does that mean it's all a giant  hoax yes all the way yes  number one the Internet holds the key  for years scientists Robert Nemiroff and  Teresa Wilson from Michigan  Technological University had developed a  method of scanning the internet for  references to things being made before  they actually happen for example one of  their test phrases is Pope Francis  considering that he is the first of his  name anyone using these exact words  before that Pope was announced would  therefore be a time traveler right I  mean so far rounding up they found zero  time travelers but have stated that they  might still be out there but we quote  good at covering their tracks hmm  announce our list did we miss any out  tell us about it in the comments and  don't forget to Like share and subscribe  and you can follow me on Twitter here  I'm Adam from what culture comm and I'll  see you soon or yesterday or something  time travel ",3
VaWhBsJ3VIg,"what up naughty steppers corner Whitmore  here again with another video for you on  the naughty step channel and it is time  to talk about nausea Tuesday was a sad  day for lovers of bass music as the  legendary trio nausea announced they  would be parting ways after 20 years  together citing creative differences  between them which seems a little bit  basic as a summation of where they're at  but which works in the sense that there  was nothing more that they could give  collectively to the project in their  words a game they've completed they did  go on to finish their statement however  by saying that this is by no means the  last time they'll be working together  post-2020 having played their last show  on the eve before 2021 with nausea radio  still running up to that point as well  they predict they'll still create  together in some way with vision and  division Recordings going on beyond the  noisier concept as well but noisy itself  is a done thing a shame for those who  grew up and their music which helped  shape a lot of other music they love  today myself included and it really is  the end of an era but as they've said  better that they know it's done keeping  it intact as opposed to potentially  ruining it by carrying it on but you can  tell just how much this news has shaken  the electronic music world by the amount  of other musicians tweeting about how  incredible they are following the likes  of The Prodigy The Chemical Brothers  Daft Punk etc these guys are just as  influential within their respective  field it isn't something I can say I saw  coming or thought I ever would see but  over the last year or so you can feel  the project was slowing down a bit  trying out more experimental types of  music trying also to rein it back in  with the D&B it seemed like a tussle  between different approaches and less  like a unified thing clinging on to it  somewhat and so it actually makes me  happy that they've gone ahead to end it  and now it's time to pay tribute I asked  you guys on here and on Twitter how you  wanted me to cover this news and you had  some pretty good responses one of which  was a try not to cry challenge and I  mean I didn't when I heard of the news  but listening to all of their old stuff  again I was close the most common thing  that came up though was giving a brief  overview of their career and also my  favorite tracks so that's what I'm gonna  do give a brief history of nausea and  then run through my ten favorite songs  of theirs plus a couple of extra  before giving some final thoughts on the  trio what they mean to me personally how  I've interpreted their music the legacy  they're leaving a video to provide  memories and nostalgia for those who  grew up on and fell in love with noisia  in the same way I did but also to  provide information for the younger  demographic who won't be too familiar  with them but want to know more and I  hope you enjoy that it is a testament to  these stalwarts of base music but here  we go starting with this brief history  of nausea  nausea is comprised of three Dutchmen  Nick tae San martín who in the late 90s  rule in high school in Groningen Holland  they were graffiti artists in different  crews nick and tyson won martine in  another and they didn't really like each  other but at the same time they were all  making music nick and ties together  again martin on his own again and they  realized there was a bit of similarity  there so they started working together  following that was a few years of  solidly working trying to establish a  brand and style of music settling on a  name in the process of that nausea which  is a complete inversion of the word  vision which they saw in an upside-down  VHS tape releasing their first single in  2003 and in the next few years following  that putting out tracks for some huge  labels in the Dean be seen from moving  shadow to renegade hardware tibi  subtitles imprint Shogun audio and more  at this point also releasing under  different names like hustle athletics  frizz and drifter to account for the  genres they were exploring outside of D  and B before hurriedly ditching those  aliases in one fell swoop  realizing they didn't want to confuse  fans and followers of their music  embracing flexibility instead 2007  signifies for me their first truly  impactful branch out D&B with the  fantastically full-of-life electro house  number yellow brick earlier that year  the trio completing their first huge job  outside of nausea producing the whole of  tasha Baxter's album color of me this  was the beginning of them truly breaking  out into the base mainstream also  producing hadouken second album for the  masses and providing remixes for the  likes of The Prodigy deadmau5 and  Skrillex stretching into 2009 now in  that year we also get a feature that  propelled them even further into the  bass limelight the monstrous contact  alongside Foreign Beggars with the trio  having released a boatload of EPS and  singles at this point but 2010 brings  the moment we've all been waiting for a  debut album split the atom remains one  of the most iconic LPS in bass music .  providing hits like the title track  machine-gun red heat Diplodocus as well  as Tommy's theme and could this be in a  special 2012 edition starts with remixes  from the likes of 16-bit blacks on  Empire excision in that sick kill the  noise in 20  13 they produce an entire one-hour 20  album for a new Devil May Cry game at  the same time working on an album a  supergroup I am legion with Foreign  Beggars releasing that debut self-titled  LP in 2013 containing hits like make  those move and choosing for you not to  mention my personal favorite jellyfish  it's in 2014 that for me their  production goes up another level  altogether with the release of their  purpose EP brutal dark unforgiving DnB  music they then begin noisy a radio in  2015 as a way of showcasing  up-and-coming talent giving insight on  what they're enjoying and just keeping  fans in the loop generally 2016 bringing  about another truly long-awaited moment  in the release of their sophomore album  outer edges a stunning collection of  songs an LP which I feel will stand the  test of time as perhaps the most rounded  and complete that bass music has and  ever will see since then they've  released a remix album of outer edges  collabs with a load of familiar DMB  names on standalone singles remixed for  pendulum bringing us to this moment in  September 2019 whereas we all know the  group confirmed they would be parting  ways at the end of 2020 now I hope that  was comprehensive enough as a brief  history of nausea and that you now have  a better understanding of the scope of  their work but now for the fun part my  top 10 in order of release  Yellow Brick which I mentioned earlier  exuberant and colorful but dark and  impending big nostalgia attached to this  one for me a real journey love this song  so much contact with foreign beggars  another which I mentioned earlier pre I  am legion extremely weighty explosive  beat vocals dancing over it perfectly  great chemistry top tune machine gun  perhaps the most freakish off-the-wall  creative and animated that we've ever  heard from them in one song I love how  it develops incredible song split the  atom one of the best introductions I've  ever heard lively venture into house  music so well put together  adventurous fantastic stuff their remix  of earthquake by labyrinth my favorite  remix of theirs I think this one  completely stops time the drops are also  like earthquakes and also really  interesting ideas in those drop sections  mode production quality very well  assembled could this be the more pensive  and reflective side of noisiest style  still full of energy in life but with a  solidness to it that still so powerful  really leaves a mark does stop with the  art beats envelops you spits you back  out in these visceral drops unrelenting  effortless magnetic pull with a lovely  DnB flow and rhythm to it jellyfish as I  am Legion with foreign beggars musically  it's potentially my favorite song of  theirs so effective without trying to do  too much it's cute and pointed crazy  attention to detail yeah it just works  so well Collider momentous epic  uncontainable I've always loved this  song but I've only over time realized  just how exceptional it is on all fronts  it really does tick every box and  finally the entangled I think I would  have to call this my favourite noisier  tune so beautifully put together  graceful intricate heartfelt  exceptionally constructed and just hits  in all the right spots and now I'm going  to give you a couple of extras that were  just outside my top ten for nausea so  we've got the liquid with evil intent  seven stitches red heat make those move  there remix of smack my bitch up by The  Prodigy there remix also of era kiss by  Black Sun Empire omnivore with the  upbeats cleansing with former the  purpose EP all love it a note  tract say that I love from start to  finish but that EP really is so on point  in its production from beginning to end  brilliant stuff and a couple of extras  also from the outer edges album that I  love anomaly tentacles and get deaded  and following on from there time for  some final thoughts on this legendary  trio and honestly where to begin with  the impact they've had over this 20-year  period  on a musical level Skrillex who noisia  mentored said they were pure arts the  sound design taking you into its own  world which is hard to disagree with  their music always feel so alive real  and Atmospheric that it seems to embody  a living thing someone literally sitting  or standing right next to you the most  technically insane that Skrillex ever  saw which really is saying something  music with an instantly classic feel  regardless of how old it may be known  mostly as a Denby collective but they  branched out into so much more from  dubstep to housebreak be grime glitch  you name it  bringing the neuro approach further into  the base consciousness along the way  heavily inspiring other huge bass groups  like Coen sound and people talk about  the sound design gods of today but none  of them are on that level without nausea  they made that level of sound design  realizable for everyone else beyond  their own music owning three labels at  once in vision division and invisible  producing albums for several other  musicians fronts are back maintaining  nausea radio for years producing for a  wide array of different video games  taking their self controlled  audio-visual tour around the world  changing the bass scene so much in the  process  achieving undoubted legend status in the  sphere of electronic music UKF noting in  their recent interview with them that  most EDM groups just fizzle out but  noisy are so big they had to let  everyone know they have promised to go  out with a bang and what this means  beyond live shows and the continuation  of noisy a radio until the end of next  year I'm not so sure but ultimately it  is the end of an era undeniably sad but  hopefully the start of new and exciting  things for them going forward nausea may  be gone very soon but they've left more  than enough of a legacy to ensure that  they will live on in the heart of bass  music forever and yeah I'm gonna leave  it on that note  not gonna say too much more but I hope  you enjoyed the video and if you did I  would really appreciate it if you could  like it and subscribe to the channel if  you haven't already but yeah I shall see  all of you in the next one long live  noisier peace out  [Music]  [Music] ",1

PVvxWxfLFLY,"I've had the story for three years I've  had this interview with Virginia Roberts  we would not put it on the air first of  all I was told who's Jeffrey Epstein no  one knows who that is this is a stupid  story then the palace found out that we  had her whole allegations about Prince  Andrew and threatened us a million  different ways we were so afraid we  wouldn't be able to interview Kate  we'll think that we got also quashed the  story and then and then Alan Dershowitz  was also implicated in because of the  planes up she told me everything she had  pictures she knew everything that is the  kind of video that it's the it's the  it's the media equivalent of when when  you put a family member in hospice right  and you know that's like the Hotel  California right you can check in  anytime you like but you don't ever  leave right I have personal experience  yeah yeah everybody knows it's a one-way  trip okay and you may have loved ones  that live there for weeks months maybe a  year or more and you know it becomes  routine to go visit them you know  depending on how long they've been in  there and and you in somewhere in your  subconscious you know every time you  walk through the front door that they're  never coming out right you know that  right you know but the normal seas of  life the distractions of the day the  time you're spending with them  relationally it's in the back of your  mind but it's just not present all of  the time and then the day comes that you  get the call and even though you knew  this call was coming this entire time  from the moment you checked them into  this hospice the day that you get that  call hits you like a ton of bricks right  correct even though you knew it was  coming you knew it was inevitable you  knew every day it could have happened at  any point in time you're not surprised  that this was the way this ended but the  the impact of experiencing it  nonetheless is fairly  fairly devastating right that's how I  felt watching that video this morning  amy robach you went to work Amy every  day for the last three years nothing  nothing no nothing and you were like  makeover tips with the fabulous Desmond  tomorrow and Good Morning America  nothing you had this all for the last  three years nothing by the way three  years ago bill Bill Clinton's wife was  running for president I might add  nothing yet nothing couldn't be bothered  to find out that the potential first man  was a compatriot of a guy who right now  is probably being sodomized in hell I  just decided you know  tomato tomahto I'm frustrated but you  know hey you know we've got you know  holiday horror stories tomorrow on Good  Morning America with life moves on  you're all terrible people all of you  you're just wretches terrible and you  need to repent because hell is hot and  forever and you've been appointed in  these positions as watch people on a  wall that's this is this is the job and  you just went back to work every day for  the last three years and if you listen  to her complaint it's all I had this  story not nothing how many girls do you  think got terrorized these last few  years because we kept our mouth shut  no it's I had the scoop and they  wouldn't let me use it it's not about  the truth  it's about you bingo  why trust these these people on anything  anything if they're gonna sit there and  say we're not going to expose arguably  the worst living American not in a in a  maximum-security prison cell as we speak  because it we won't get the new royal  couple tell me then why do we trust them  to give us anything on anything ever why  would we believe anything if they're  this vape 'add morally corrupt why would  we trust them on anything anything if  they can't be bothered with expose the  rich straight white billionaire human  trafficking girls to be gang-raped if  they can't be trusted with that if  that's if there's no journalistic  integrity there tell me then how you  could trust them on anything on anything  the fact that you will not see their  peers line up today to condemn them for  keeping this silent they're all just  terrible people terrible and I don't  know why any person with a soul and and  motor function would trust them on  anything  you ",3
U9DyHthJ6LA,"ah scuse me is there a toilet nearby  quickly do you mine I've got it is it  nearby there's right into the green room  right into the green room  [Music]  hey what's going on everybody for first  we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're  watching hot ones it's the show with  hack questions and even hotter wings and  it's a banner day in internet history as  we open up season eight with Gordon  Ramsay he's one of the world's most  decorated and successful chefs with an  empire that includes more than a dozen  restaurants countless best-selling  cookbooks and seven hit TV shows  including MasterChef junior which  returns to Fox this February Gordon  Ramsay welcome to the show  great to see you so we started hot ones  about four years ago and shortly after  we put up our first episode we're  bombarded with requests to get Gordon  Ramsay on the show and as the show has  grown so too has that albatross around  our necks which has followed me from the  Internet to the airport to my family  get-togethers so this one is very much  for the fans  I'm nervous in a good way but at the  same time I feel like a weight has been  lifted off my shoulder so I just want to  say thank you for coming in today you're  welcome good to see you Congrats by the  way thank you very season eight amazing  and I have four kids there pay me to  come on this dad I want to see how good  your palate is or how strong your palate  is you've got a big mouth you shout and  scream all day long but can you take a  hot wing  so finally under immense pressure from  the family and a lot of supporters out  there I'm here the world has pressured  us into this room Gordon that is it if  it all goes tits up after this it  doesn't matter we may be hot ones okay  [Music]  okay so how long were these wings cook  for oh I knew that this was gonna happen  damn yeah yeah cuz a bit fucking  overcooked fly eating a mouthful of  fucking sand  [Music]  a good wing look at your arms that's a  good wing right there yeah yeah but so  it needs a bit meat on them things like  a quail so Gordon as we mentioned in  your intro MasterChef junior comes back  next month one of your many shows that  become a global phenomenon when you  think back and all the times you've been  wowed by the raw talent of a child on  that show is there a story that stands  out I think of some of the earlier kids  now you're back on season one the other  into the 18 19 year old Alexander from  season 1 and yeah this guy is a prolific  chef he's barely 19 years of age and for  the last five years he spent weekends  and holidays in some of the most amazing  restaurants across the world so I say  them no mom no dad no school teacher you  love me gonna hate me it's gonna be the  best football coach you ever met in your  life but you'll come out of this a much  better cook and they do what's been the  most disturbing thing that you've ever  seen unnoticed or uncared-for at a  restaurant and Kitchen Nightmares that's  a really good question so I went into a  refrigeration unit once and saw a tartar  sauce three and a half years out of date  how fucking dumb must you be to use this  tartar sauce that's stank to use a  source that's festering bubbling like  something out of fucking Harry Potter  that was off three years ago several  Stuart littles spotted in the corner the  kitchen yeah big motherfuckers not like  cats I didn't know they only have cats  they didn't resemble hey it was a  fucking rats  yeah pretty shocking from rats to mold  to recently come across the restaurant  with plastic cheese over nachos covered  in mold you have any idea how long  cheese needs to sit in a fridge that's  plastic cheese to get mold fucking years  yes  hippie-dippie green while they smoke you  might come up with these names probably  opium okay  hmm okay so the restaurant business is  notoriously difficult with these thin  margins and then of course infinite  space for human error and then when  you're a chef who's famous and has this  large empire that goes across several  continents you end up being a target for  the type of Yelper or TripAdvisor  comment or there's like this place is a  total ripoff I could have made it for  three dollars can you explain in  layman's terms the basic math behind how  a twenty five dollar cheeseburger might  end up on a menu mmm  I've seen chefs with freaking gold leaf  on a burger ready to get to a hundred  dollar mark which is a bit stupid really  because you don't go near a fucking  burger with gold leaf and white ain't  that flavor so twenty five dollar burger  it's all about the patty the thickness  the blend it depends on whether it's a  Chuck for the short rib a great brioche  bun and how you lay that up with here  all the trappings of a luxurious burger  is there a hidden cost and running a  restaurant that most diners are unaware  of yeah it's called rent and labor costs  two big key factors in running a  successful business  landlords they win either way so the  more successful you are the more rent  they ask for the less successful you are  the more demanding of the rent so the  great way of identifying a classy  restaurant is being full on a Monday  night Friday Saturday we'll look that'll  take care of itself naturally if you can  fill it Monday Tuesday Wednesday you'll  not depend of the way there  [Music]  fucking grapefruit in hot sauce few  series I know that you spent your early  years studying classic French technique  you're bouncing around restaurants and  London and Paris working alongside some  of the most influential chefs in the  world so at that in mind I want to  bounce some of the people some of the  mentors that helped shape Gordon Ramsay  into this battle-hardened perfectionist  that we see today and just curious what  you learned about cooking what you  learned about business maybe even what  you learned about life from each okay  we'll start with Marco Pierre White mhm  fucking phenomenon a nut buster a  ballbreaker  super talented chef if you thought my  performance sometimes was shocking in  the kitchen that was a fucking Hollywood  blockbuster right there Oscar nominated  Marc appear wine  that guy had finesse he could close his  eyes and dress a play beautifully and he  could come out looking like a Gucci  handbag  I mean stunning how about geese of what  he said what was amazing it was like  this perfect Frenchman that was your  hardest fuck on the outside and then you  look at him it's the kind of guy that  your grandma would take the fucking  bingo we had one and a half days off a  week that half a day if you took that  half day  you're fucked so he had to be in there  no pay and shown willingness you have to  learn and as an English cook enough  education I had to bust my ass off twice  as hard now yeah one of the best chefs  living today and still a prominent  figure nada cuisine how about Joel  Robuchon Robert Sean was a taskmaster  combined Marco Tony Bourdain geesa wah  Alvaro  all together and you've got durable shop  because you know and the outside world  it was this incredible successful genius  but behind the scenes oh my god you know  from raviolis flying over your head to  fucking copper pans to I used to see  ducks flying from one end of the case of  the other thinking that just reborn the  fucking wings  the only thing was missing with the  feathers I remember me telling me that  the best thing ever happened to was a  shit that ran down my mother's leg when  she gave birth to me how did you get up  in the morning concentrate and work the  next day on that one then so for all  those beautiful Millennials and  snowflakes out there trust me the more  you get pushed the thicker your skin  they're picking your skin  trust me the higher you go  [Music]  cheaver goal from where out of New  Jersey rights to a gold and you mind if  I sponsor the wings getting forwarded is  like pay for some fucking decent meat on  those that would be a dream come true  for us there's a trade emails we'll  trade emails South nippy at the  beginning is like nip nip nip  immediately so it's not a it's fine no  mm-hmm it's not super hot so with your  many best-selling cookbooks than your  how-to tutorials online you've inspired  a generation maybe several how to up  their food game but today we want to  give a lesson to the spice Lords can you  break down the perfect Gordon Ramsay at  home burger and describe how to make it  as much detail as possible yeah so for  me it's about that blend I would go  sixty ground beef ten percent fat blend  that with Tim sent Chuck and then I  would do almost like a luxurious for it  in there and then the last parts  somewhat lean so a bit of a tri-tip in  there in a way that it sort of holds  that thing together so it's tight the  cedar of great burgers in the seasoning  and so to many people make the burger  but they don't season it properly so  season this thing chili flakes garlic  powder salt pepper severe seared strong  Kara's Asian on top and then it's the  basting and so once you've caramelized  that burger on top don't worry about it  still being raw inside you baste because  as you base that the butter it seeps  through and become so much more richer  the fat camera Liza's on top of the  burgers the flavor layers beautiful  brioche bun beauty toasted and then bait  so not is it toasted but it holds  substantially all those juices the most  important thing about a burger let that  thing rest before you bite into it and  that's what happens sometimes they cook  the burger they buying a meal it's our  man it's all pissing out yeah let it  rest let it sit inside there and then  stack of usually  [Music]  so you made this one and it's out  fucking day 2017 can't you afford  fucking sourcing dates oh no I just  stage battles oh is that good yeah  bullshit here we go  so where's my nice I like that you do  yeah that's quite zesty that's that's  fruity I like that smug Serrano some  more engine there yeah I mean I'm not  too sure about apricot but big big  that's good image now it's getting  hotter you know yeah little bit is sort  of starting to move on the armpits I'm  sweating that's how we do it here Gordon  Gordon we have a recurring segment on  our show called explain that Graham  where we do a deep dive and I guess  Instagram pull interesting pictures that  need more context yes I'll bust out the  laptop I'll show you the picture so you  just tell me the bigger story does that  sound good  yes sir I do brilliant Judy's diving  people talking Instagram what's wrong  with you  do you go for another okay Gordon first  things first  do you remember this meeting of the  minds courtside at the lakers game you  David Beckham and Kobe Bryant yeah I got  absolutely fucked there really yeah  because five minutes prior to that I  threw the first ball out of the Dodger  Stadium the game was so fucking boring  DB takes place a cleansing basketball so  I went to the basket way I got into such  trouble because you can't go from  throwing the first pitch out then go and  watching the fucking basketball ten  minutes later can you well you again  yeah no not good and so yes at ringside  there it was the first time in my life  for six for two I felt like a short us  it was fucking 7-foot tall it's no  longer down there it's like shit so  loved the game and yeah Kobe one athlete  Jesus incredible do you remember this  lunch service at Downing Street with  Tony Blair and Vladimir Putin yeah I  mean quite honestly probably the first  time as a chef I still between two guys  customers actually shat myself thinking  this could go off any minute  entering down these streets getting  pelted by see if their supporters  outside they're anti-putin and anti flan  ever since that day I've never got  involved in politics right based on that  lunch  you mentioned turning one of those  leaders ill based on a funky and bad  oyster or a shit chicken wing we didn't  serve tickling his there by the way  I did the most amazing paramos to sea  bass with a computer martyr and a  beautiful shellfish vinaigrette and we  finished with a Bakewell tart so I  remember the menu you know as if it's  last week powerful lunch but couldn't  wait to get the fuck out there  [Music]  yeah okay that's hot now tingling them  again yeah in the back half here mm-hmm  yeah yeah hmm okay so we've talked a lot  about your tangible accomplishment yes  Michelin stars TV ratings yeah I'm  curious about some of the more unusual  highlights and lowlights from your life  of the following daredevil moments which  was more intense hunting down a Burmese  python butchering a wild boar are  tracking down puffins in Iceland yeah I  have to say tracking down puffins in  Iceland let me know via this is how this  country lived  yeah four four four four decades that  level of protein across those winter  months is brutal so sort of hanging off  a 600 meter high cliff with a rope and a  fucking net catching this furry bird to  eat and I made this amazing dish puck  that's hot that thing by the way shit it  started to come true now what you're  laughing at yeah it's a big deep breath  so and I made this amazing puffin salad  made this bread yeah and improved it in  this active volcano in Iceland dug the  hole stuck it in amongst these rocks  came back the next day and fucking bed  was nicked someone stole it so I'm still  looking for that Viking that stole that  fucking amazing loaf of bread bastards  [Music]  oh yeah yeah okay yeah nice moving yeah  yeah also it's just a little bit it's  not time not good that one is it it's a  tough one yeah sort of one also it's us  mm-hmm  so when people have reached their peak  in a profession whether it's Kobe Bryant  I think that's uh I feel like that  burning a new ring on my fucking ass you  and I both Gordon III on this one now I  know this song means Ring of Fire was  that Johnny Cash I won in this fuckin  seat there's nothing coming through so  we're okay  all right but everybody in production be  ready okay yeah ring a fire holy fuck  yeah asshole is somebody with a foot in  both worlds who's more insufferable TV  critics or restaurant critics the both  come from the same cloth to the both  standing staring I wish they could be  you so fuck you take on the chin chin  please you in the same pot well you know  it seems like on paper at least that you  would enjoy the linguistic flair of a  good take down so I'm curious I want to  hit you with a few infamously savage  restaurant reviews and I'm just curious  how about your ear from an insult level  before you go there I remember once the  unique standard years ago when I first  opened and this amazing food critic  described one of my dish yeah I scored  it you know shit yeah looking like toxic  scum on a stagnant pool I'm like fucking  really that's how you describe my  fucking dish toxic skull in a stagnant  pool shit did I really hurt you that  much let me bounce this one off of lace  from Jay Rayner writing for The Guardian  in 2013 he said of the muscles at Leon  de Brussels in London the meat inside  the shells is small and shriveled and  dry each shell contains what looks like  the retracted scrotum of a hairless cat  Wow so that's savage right yeah so we  can't talk about quitting's like that  but they can talk about us like that I'm  a firm believer in keeping it  professional but not personal so I had a  run-in once with a critic and  unfortunately asked him to leave but  fuck my heart's beating as well like  fucking the drum what is going on with  these fucking wings did you make this  sauce this next one is from Pete Welles  in the New York Times Guy Fieri's  restaurant in Times Square  why is one of the few things on your  menu that can be eaten without fear  regret called a roasted pork Bonnie when  it resembles that item about as much as  you resemble Emily Dickinson jesus  christ almighty a good morning glad  you've had a fucking great day I know  guy but any chef that turns around puts  a donkey sauce on his fucking menu gonna  get a kick in ok cuz if my wife was sat  there thinking sweetheart have the ribs  with the donkey sauce it doesn't quite  ring well does it you know shit happens  take it ok and shut the fuck up and then  one more at the risk of being a bit  cheeky yes Owen is from the late Sunday  Times writer a a go about your own  restaurant aubergine in the 90s the chef  is a failed sportsman who acts like an  11 year old fuck him fuck him  yeah I didn't realize coming the hot  ones I'll leave you fucking free  ourselves yeah I mean Jesus Christ nice  I have a fucking you can now put a label  on that fucking thing Jimmy huh it  haunts my dreams  yeah I mean the wings are getting  fucking smaller and smaller now they  look like my fucking granddad's no  fucking these fucking big toe how'd you  get

acid mm-hmm Jesus  Christ  yes what's the fuck's gonna happen  tomorrow we're back behind the line  tasting and perfecting right the fuck  you gonna be tomorrow I mean not to  coinage shit I'll be in town I'll be in  town Gordon and you're never one to  mince words when it comes to items that  don't reach your culinary standards  whether it's your hub food that's laced  in truffle oil our tasting menus overrun  with foams but how does Gordon Ramsay  feel about some of the 2018 food trends  that have been bubbling up across social  media we'll find out today  Steven laptop please Gordon how are

a5qbaxYhbL8,"now okay but let lets tell me how the  connection between aliens and the Nazis  took place when did all this start let  me let me begin this is really telling  you Joe this is a real deal  I believe you this is you ask who are  they it's people who are psychically  genetically available to interface in  this incredibly diverse universe with  all these dimensions above and below and  all around us with consciousnesses and  the truth is no energies ever destroyed  all continues on the truth is our body  this is a fact or a communal hive  organism of all of our ancestors and all  of their race memories but not in just  some compressed epigenetic system it's  beyond that it's an electrochemical  antenna they've proven this that  connects to higher and lower dimensions  so our bodies soup sorry because our  predecessors wouldn't put us in the  position without giving us a bodysuit  that is them our families are loving us  they're holding us they're wrapped all  around us their strength or will their  bad their good their sins the good  things they did the battles they won the  battles they lost the woman they loved  the man they loved it's all in us all  these people it's while we're able to  look into so many things and have so  many different experiences and so all  the shaman all the ancient religions  everybody says there are the good ones  and there are the bad ones and people  are interfacing so you say where does it  begin from the Tibetans to the  Mesoamericans to the Egyptians to the  Druids to every ancient society  describes the same thing there are bad  things that look like elves that have  horns when they show you who they really  are and there are good things but they  don't contact you unless you contact  them and then they they're almost not  even concern what you're doing I never  bought into this looked into it but then  I begin to think about what did I hear  when I was a kid what did I see what was  coming out government documents what was  being admitted when I read all these  books about World War two of the Nazis  and Hitler obsessed with the Dalai Lama  and the Tibetans and what they were able  to do without drugs to interface with  this and all the rituals they would do  and how they were believed that beyond  the ether like at skullenbones is a  German death cult they do originals and  take drugs to talk to the goddesses well  they're just appearing as you know sex  beautiful women it's whatever you want  as the spirit guides because lower  entities will come in and violate your  free will God and His angels which are  below him will not get involved in your  everyday life they will not manipulate  your free will unless you ask them in  but then the devil masquerades as an  angel of light so we're on this planet  the third dimension which is a launchpad  all the other dimensions below and above  the third dimension all the mathematic  shows is is the primal see of where all  this happens in the Earth's like an egg  and we've got all this potentiality and  God will send out a transmission for a  larger plan but evils willing to come in  and what does it say demoralize get rid  of children don't have kids humans are  bad you'll be will be better once you're  all gone and it's because it's their  operational mission for whatever reason  that will understand later what's going  on so the Nazis we get the deep  literature they believed they were  basically say on seing and and and and  being possessed by entities that I mean  it was before the Nazis for whatever  reason it was the Germans that this  happened to and the Swiss like they  didn't discovered LSD in the 30s these  these people were running with  psychology departments they were  interfacing with the occult they were  involved in all this crazy stuff and it  was all about their power and how great  they were gonna be and the Germans were  seduced and they were seduced because  they had high IQs but more than that  they were psychically connected to each  other and would work like robots the  this Chinese and the EU want robots four  places till fall orders and the Chinese  are very conscious when they're  conscious controls are very robotic  but the Germans are just as robotic so  this entity system picked Germans as its  attempt even in world war one world war  two and it was manipulating the Brits as  well and offering them technologies but  two different paths one with social  control and also their stuff with the  Brits the other was high-tech weapons  systems interdimensional with the  Germans and so whoever these players are  you can dial in took is very dangerous  they're manipulating the British arm  versus the German arm and then they've  got the Chinese arm that's almost seems  like their robot army and and and so  when you study at the globalists go to  these events and  take bigger and bigger doses of drugs  they do electroshock if you go back the  owners of time-life books didn't work  just in the 20s and 30s in the LSD and  and other hallucinogens an apothecary  they weren't dealing electroshock they  were they were they were having people  turn their heart off to like try to  communicate with these things to try to  be dominant and get that so you go back  thousands of years Merlin you know the  archetype of order or these magicians or  these these wizards are taking drugs in  these temples and interfacing with these  palan tears these crystal balls which  normally crystal balls it's their  psychic focus of an international  connection while they're on drugs  looking in the glass to then be able to  see the future and understand what's  happening to give them temporal power  over this planet but like the Bible  tells you any pharmakeia or any of that  always leads to destruction because only  evil is gonna come through that way so  we're basically have these light sockets  we can't jack into the higher unless  it's our free will and that takes time  we jack in to the evil so you can jack  into evil you can't jack into good right  away so it's quicker it's easier like  Yoda says about Darth Vader quicker  easier more seductive and so then I  remember being a kid and and my parents  they don't really get mad about this is  whatever they even know they were here  at the time but they had friends that  they knew at UT they were involved in  research projects and then and then they  were and nine times out of ten I heard  about research projects in San Francisco  UT has some MIT has a lot and Tommy  Tommy won but this was in like the 60s  they had virtual reality gloves where  you'd put them on and put goggles on and  you'd go into stuff that looked like the  holodeck from Star Trek 20 years for it  existed and they were doing surgeries  and all this and they would do empathy  loads where they'd say we need the  public because we're so weak because the  West is so strong people haven't had  trauma so they sold them low level oh  we're gonna create trauma like when you  go to Mars you're not getting any  gravity so your hearts don't go when you  get there organizing all this well they  don't tell you they go it's a special  class you've been at you so in the 60s  they had plus a special class of people  that are organizing all this shit is the  last course but is this for what purple  you don't know I'm Jane  Jack Parsons was his propulsion  laboratory Aleister Crowley devil  worship exactly allocates the weather  unit so you're still a dolly over a  hundred years ago  the founder of JPL Chad Parsons have you  heard this before no I just can't  believe I didn't want to have Alex on  the partner but I'm not bullshitting you  okay I'm telling you this the stuff I  don't believe in this okay there it is  right there this is patented in 1957 the  VR machine exactly know exactly crazy so  I have two ways the people not just  family gives you wind vibration aroma  stereo sound power motion wide vision  and 3d three-dimensional but let me tell  you they wore a mask in the 60s and 70s  that was already like you see like  paper-thin TV screens and it was already  I talked about they said there's no way  this was human technology so you've seen  these foldable phones yeah yeah I think  the aliens have already taken over  Samsung and hallway yes do you think the  aliens are taking over Samsung they have  a something something to do with Samsung  well obviously that's what I'm telling  you is that the Pentagon isn't worried  about us Jamie this is the patent Wow  and notice that's the week of the 60s I  believe 1957 so notice that's exactly  what your bitch that's what my dad told  me that's what our HTC vive looks like  we have another suspect my dad didn't  tell me this till he saw any game and he  said no son we had virtual reality  goggles and we had cd-rom and we had  things and then something else happened  and I'm not at liberty to get into it  but I was shown three years ago what the  University of Washington was doing under  Bill Gates and this is in the 90s what  were they doing what do you do they they  don't even know what they're being given  it's intervening us so you think it's  some sort of alien intervention-- type  shit dude they they they to get even  deeper they turn your heart off for five  minutes  and they pump oxygen into your blood and  you're in the meetings I've talked to  people they're involving top scientists  and you're in the meetings with freaking  aliens hey elves is the main group but  there's no by shutting your heart off it  makes you have that psychedelic  experience by keeping blood in your  oxygen it's keeps you alive well let's  explain okay the heart goes out the body  thinks it's dead right so you can stay  in longer I don't know all the science  behind it I understand but let's explain  this letting you die eating DMT or  ayahuasca 200 times 'mother like most  are astronauts a test pilots are flying  planes those are robots Cal it's all  mind war so these dudes are like it  stops working once you've taken in  hundreds of times so then they start  taking their most psychic people who are  able to do this they turn their heart  off and then they put them into these  these events and and it's like the  things the aliens tell them they come  out and they tell scientists and it  works so like what kind of shit they  didn't tell me you killed for this stuff  Joe this is not what you think they want  me off here there's one I finally  figured this out because I never touch  aliens I kind of knew the whole thing  already here's what I'm talking about  when I was a kid  eight-nine whoever was this one this  lady would come over that my parents is  ute and was involved and she talked  about yeah we call it the psychedelic  research adjusted or if the name was  that's really a CIA deal and you know we  just can't find people that can handle  it they're going in the elves want this  and the elves want us to basically  reduce population and agree to these  certain plans and it's always the  humanization and they call them the else  it's the clockwork else and they're like  yeah and this is my parents are like  seven eight years old like they don't  think you're listening talking about  well this is what the elves want this is  what they're gonna do and the thing is  it's not my parents aren't that special  you go out to San Francisco it's all  there is dude it's a cult man utin all  these guys you know from San Francisco  dude you look at look at the head of  Google or YouTube or freaking Apple he's  on TV  Tim Cook and his eyes are this big under  lights man these guys are on stuff it's  like nobody even knows what do you think  they're on stuff they've been given I  mean I know people at UT they won't tell  me specifically but I was like the dude  who owns you - who's that guy what's his  it's a girl you sexist pig misses her  take-take-take Pachauri dude there's not  like a jack dorsey of youtube take take  take take send arbitrary he goes in  Congress I'm there he's the CEO of  YouTube he's a CEO of Google Google  sorry and he's literally on TV knowing  we never fixed the result we don't spy  on anybody there is no surveillance and  you've got all these old white men and  I'm not saying a white man to be trendy  it's all a bunch of old dumb ass white  men and a couple of dumb asshole Mexican  black ladies they're all dumb but I will  call they are going so you don't spout  it or control it  meanwhile their own perspectives to  their shareholders is how they control  it all now they're gonna deliver maximum  profit and Sundar's like yes it is true  we have never controlled the search  result and it's just I'm just listening  to pure lies meanwhile this guy is only  the front guy of Eric Schmidt and God  knows what they're into there I mean it  has I've been proven that Google does  something to to alter search results I'm  asking because I don't know I'm not  asking to fuck with you yeah what did  they do  Google itself is about if you pay them  they put your results at the top just  like Facebook okay well that's  definitely altering search results so  what he said was not true if they if you  can pay it's like saying watering wet  Joe hmm I know you know all this stuff  no no no I don't know that I don't know  that now listen I'm honest about what I  don't know I know some things but I  there's a lot of fuckin holes in my  knowledge base that's a fact well you  know that they try to block my name and  direct it toward negative stuff I'm sure  they do  manipulate all they do is all they do is  the negative you attack me it's it's  digital currency you go to the top and  they pay you money right some of your  buddy a little tip watching attacked me  lie about me to go to the top it you  lose your soul",3

az6NibAUf7Y,"The most obsolete idea  is go to school, get a job, work hard, save money,  get out of debt and invest for the long-term in the stock market  See, why would you save money  when they're printing trillions of dollars?  The gap between the 1% and 99% is massive.  You see it's not just money,  you have to step back and look at the bigger picture.  So what do you do?  In every one of us there's a poor person,  there's still a poor person inside me.  There's also a middle-class person  and the middle-class person wants security  they want that steady paycheck.  And there's a rich person  And they're all inside of us except that...  It's not taught.  It's- you're taught to go to school, get a job and get a paycheck.  Not taught how to get rich.  If you've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, my rich dad refused to pay me.  He said the paycheck  was one of the most damaging things you can take in your life.  He says the moment you take a paycheck you're an employee  and that's the mindset.  So my rich dad never paid me.  It drove my poor dad, you know, a government employee nuts.  ""You got to pay people, you got to pay people""  And rich dad was not saying that the paycheck was bad,  he says he didn't want to be a slave to money.  So as an entrepreneur,  you know, if rich dad folded  I just try another company.  I don't need a paycheck.  I don't need anybody to take care of me.  If my government doesn't like me I move to another country  because they need entrepreneurs there.  So the entrepreneur is not so much the business,  the entrepreneur is really the mindset and the skill sets  and the different set of rules.  You see, I don't operate small business  does not not operate in the same rules as big business.  Entrepreneur is a mindset first,  a skill set and rules.  And depending upon whether you're an employee or small business  the rules are different,  the mindsets are different, the skill sets are different.  If you could say one thing to somebody whose never been an entrepreneur  and they're thinking about making the leap of faith  into becoming an entrepreneur,  what could you tell them?  Well, I'll just tell them the same thing that happened to me.  You know, my last paycheck, I still remember it clearly  it was one of the worst and the best days of my life  and I was in Puerto Rico,  I was in, I was working for Xerox  and my boss gave me my last, it wasn't a paycheck it was a bonus check  I think it was about 30,000 bucks  taxable, that's the only problem with that.  So I get this check and I went, ""Holly mackerel.""  You know, I mean, so I was excited  but I was also disturbed.  And so this other guy comes up to me, his name was John  and John says to me says to me this,  ""you're going to be back."" I said ""Why?""  he says, ""because you're going to fail.""  I looked at him and I said, ""look...  few expletive words  Because that's what he did, he left Xerox, failed and he came back.  I said, ""look...  You fail and you came back  but I'm going to fail and I'm never coming back.""  and that's the attitude.  - Do you know what I mean, - yeah  If you say, ""Well, if I fail I'll go back to mommy and daddy""  then that's what you'll do.  So if you fail, that's when I became an entrepreneur because I had no money.  I had no money for years  Yeah, I didn't have a paycheck  But that's what my rich dad encouraged me to do.  He says when, when you don't have this paycheck  you get hungrier, smarter and it's a test of your character  will you become a crook? Will you become dishonest?  Will you cheat and steal?  Or will you become a better human being?  So really that's the benefit of becoming an entrepreneur  you really find out who you are  when you don't have anything.  So you always have to look at the big picture.  Too many people look at, ""well, what's, what's going to happen to me?""  When you look at the big picture, you're also going to know  that when something bad happens something good is going to happen.  But you gotta prepare for whatever is coming  If you think the next 20 years will be like the last 20 years  you're going to get creamed.  You know, when you and I go to the supermarket  and we buy a carton of milk  We always check for the expiration date.  But most people do not check for the expiration date on their brains  Instead of getting out of debt I get into debt.  I just refinanced 300 million in debt  I went from 5% to 2.5% interest  I made a fortune.  Every month more money comes in because my cost of money has gone down.  So while some financial experts are saying get out of debt,  I'm saying learn how to use debt.  See when I came back from serving in Vietnam  in January of 73  and the first thing my rich dad said to me was,  ""Go to school to learn how to invest in real estate.""  It wasn't real estate, it was how to use debt and taxes  debt and taxes make the rich richer.  Debt and taxes make the poor and middle class poorer.  So all the rich guys who are doctors and lawyers or...  you know, those guys, they're getting creamed  - and they don't know why - doctors are getting creamed?  Oh, yeah, they're making more money but the take-home is less  You know, my doctor just yelled at me  he's happy, he says, ""Oh, guess what I finally made a million dollars.""  And I said, ""Yeah"", this is just three weeks ago.  And so I said, ""Yeah, well how much you pay in tax?""  He says, ""$750,000 in taxes.""  So his net was about $400,000  That's not bad  but when I make a million bucks, I keep a million bucks.  And the reason is because I don't make it by working for money.  See if you work for money your taxed.  So that's why lesson number one in Rich Dad Poor Dad  is the rich don't work for money.  What we do instead is we create businesses as entrepreneurs.  We acquire real estate.  I don't invest in the stock market  So the reason is because as entrepreneurs  I have more control over my income,  how much I make and how much I pay in taxes.  And because I'm an entrepreneur as well as an investor in real estate  I pay zero tax.  So every time I make let's say a million dollars as an entrepreneur  I immediately invest it in real estate, and I have a 4 to 1 step up.  So I put a million dollars in real estate, I get four million from the bank.  That's why I love banks.  But the banks are screwing everybody else  you know, terrible but it's good for me.  I thought you said when you print it's good for you  but when you print it's bad for people that work for money.  Because when you print savers get creamed  and people who work for money get creamed.  When they print debtors get rich.  You see, debt and taxes make the rich richer  and debt and taxes make the poor and middle class poorer.  When we have obsolete ideas we get obsolete results.  So what's happening for most people  the idea of going to school,  getting a job, working hard, saving money, getting out of debt,  buying your house because it's an asset and investing for a long term.  It's obsolete.  The world has changed, the world changed in 1971  when President Nixon took us off the gold standard  and money became debt.  What if we get rid of school then what would happen?  Would it be better if we had no educational system at all?  No, I'm saying education was more important before, it's just obsolete.  You know, there's Moore's law that...  Moore's law which states information doubles every 18 months.  In other words, everything is obsolete, 18 months.  So, and this is a recent phenomenon.  So when you come out of school, you're already obsolete,  and that's why I'm the old guy,  you know, I meet my friends, I went to Harvard.  Yeah, I went to Harvard. I said,  ""Yeah, that was how long 50 years ago?""  Today the banks are charging you interest to save money.  In other words, the banks don't want your money  because they've printed too much of it.  And that's why there's bubbles and stocks and bubbles in real estate and all this.  People are dumping the cash.  Because as I said in here, ""Savers are losers and cash is trash""  And yet people are, ""Well, I want a high-paying job.""  Well, that's an obsolete idea.  Get out of debt, it's an obsolete idea.  You should learn how to get into debt How to you use debt to get rich  And they'll never teach you about taxes.  The reason the 1% is way up here and the 99% are going this way  is because when you print money two things happen  inflation and taxes.  It's crushing them.  And any entrepreneur that thinks ""I'm just going to make money  and start a business and make a lot of money because that what we talk about  They really have got to smell the roses man.  You know, that's not what the real entrepreneurs are doing.  Most entrepreneurs, there's 28 million small business owners in America  24 million are, are one person entrepreneurs.  They're called non-employee entrepreneurs.  So that because, and that's what happens  is when people don't really understand what an entrepreneur does.  So most people are self-employed, but they're not really entrepreneurs.  The self-employed pay the highest taxes of all  and nobody tells them that.  Yeah, it's also called the entrepreneurial spirit  but what we're actually talking about  was there's no such thing as a bad economy.  You know those externally, you and I, we all have an external economy.  But we also have an internal economy  and the will power is to change our internal economy.  So for me, I can see the good, I can see the bad  I don't really give a damn.  Because I'm going to be rich anyway.  But a poor person with a poor personal economy  All they're going to see is a bad economy.  Because they don't know how to make money in any economy.  And a middle-class person, they have a middle-class economy  you know what they want is a nice house, a steady paycheck  and the job and the car.  And so when you take their job away to them that's disaster.  Well since an entrepreneur doesn't have a job anyway, it's no big deal.  So all I'm saying to people is what Bucky Fuller taught me.  There's always two sides, you know what I mean,  you know to use plural at minimum two.  So if you think the economy is bad, it's because your economy is bad.  If you think that steady, you know, employment is important  - then you'll see an economy without jobs. - Your economy  Your economy versus the external economy.  Where you control VS where you can't control  I can control yes, it's called, it's called an internal focus  versus an external focus.  So the real entrepreneur has an internal focus  but if they fall down they say, ""Oh, this is good  because I'm going to go up higher.""  You know, the average person will fall down and  say ""Oh, I'm going to take some Prozac""  Or, or the- or somebody has the mistakes, all the mistakes don't matter well  Mistakes, mistakes matter, it means you didn't know something.  But a real entrepreneur whether they fall down  or they go, they always can go up  They can stand back up and go higher.  That no matter what happens to them  they got stronger and better and smarter and happier.  But a person with a weak internal mindset  Is that they're so afraid of what happens, it generally happens.  Like, you know, people who are afraid of losing their jobs  they generally lose their jobs.  - You know what I mean, - yeah,  no doubt, so everything comes through you  Yeah, so the entrepreneur first job is control inside here  not outside there.  The moment you take that paycheck you're an employee  You've got to be stronger than that.  It's about inside control. ",1
5kket_nx3FE,"yeah let's just say this reportedly you  take the NT and torture some kids to  death you're gonna be with the devil no  no be that as it may I feel that I would  be remiss to get out there and talk  about these topics without talking about  how white people buy melanin on the  black market tell me about that I don't  know of course you do  melanin melanin is it's uh it's what  yourselves that creates color and skin  but absolutely awesome it also protects  you from the Rays of the Sun sure and it  keeps but do I look like I'm using  makeups I don't you do tell me since  you're a conspiracy theorist and I  figured that you may know more about it  yes you guess what if you don't know  nothing about it need to do it let's  move oh no no no no no I know I mean I  know that a lot of white people won't be  able to get a tan I mean I absolutely  understand this is about health and  wellness this is about you know you  gotta block the Sun let me just expand  on that okay here because we have a case  in Atlanta that is very very prevalent  is the Atlanta child murders case where  there were 29 to 30 something murders  between 79 and 81 murders and  disappearances of children black  children in black neighborhoods that  were all when they were declared missing  and they they they weren't found and  those that were found most of them were  found dismembered and they they they  charged and convicted a black man for  doing this but he was charged with the  deaths of two adults these 29 Chile's  are scheduled okay now I can speak  there's also KKK members who have been  on their deathbed and said that they had  a hand in this I'm sure well let me  speak to that that I said for the  purpose of melanin okay I can speak to  that there is a huge market  blackmarket no pun intended in children  but particularly black children by  Satanist and they caught this is  Associated Press that's why they want me  off here  they caught the UN trafficking in tens  of thousands of children to Haiti but  also to Eastern Europe like his as well  and disappearing I'm using for sex  slavery a lot of the open border and the  Senate report said this who who in tens  of thousands of kids get taken across no  one's allowed to check them before  controls are put in and then they get  disappeared and two sex rituals and into  being killed and then back to that  ancient culture an ancient system of  children being used to have their energy  sucked or to basically conjure these  entity having their energies so how do  you suck the energy out of a child  well it's interdimensional and so these  entities will give you power or give you  knowledge or do things for you or attack  your enemies but the payment like you've  got to pay coins to char on to take you  across the river Styx in mythology  you've got to pay them in the blood of  innocence and that's in every culture  every society you have to pay them in  the blood of a child and the blood of an  innocent person in order for them to  give you what you need to know yes  that's the currency they want and  there's a massive traffic out of Haiti  and other areas could this person be the  devil themselves yes well let me tell  you because I don't want to I know you  eat your own show and I get your own man  I'm not gonna say names here no that's  why they want me ELISA  I'm the most bangle you know what I  don't need no job I ain't got one damn  out of this shit a podcast one Apple  podcast expeditiously the poor kid ain't  paid me one guy I'm deal on my own  freedom I'm just gonna tell you this so  I can get there if they say it tip  you'll show shut down today guess what  I'm gonna walk up out this motherfucking  go do what I do for a living well you  should keep doing it because they want  you to shut up that means you see more  powerful in your music let's expand on  this all right and I respect that  there is Aleister Crowley black magic  going on there's all these other forms  of Salix through who Aleister Crowley  Aleister Crowley so this is going on at  a massive level and they call it spirit  cooking and when it came out in the  WikiLeaks that they're doing this and  they're abusing children and they're  even killing children speaking of which  I want you to after that I want you I  wanna I want to approach the Joe Epstein  thing but I want you to finish that  Jeffrey Epstein  Jeffrey I'm sorry Jeffrey Epstein but I  want you to go I want you to finish what  you were saying but I want you to put it  on your mind that my next question is  Jeffrey Epstein just to be clear on you  when we've covered this and I've had the  you know woman whistleblower on from the  UN when they found him kidnapping tens  of thousand women and children in Europe  and selling them into slavery and so I'm  getting killed and snuff films and it  just goes on all over the place it goes  on Latin America it goes on in Haiti  right I mean you could type in UN  kidnapping African children you and  kidnapping Latin American children UN  runs this thing all over the place but  you tuned into all the beauty pageants  oh the UN's good UNICEF loves the kids  there the international group with  diplomatic immunity mm-hmm or they can  do whatever they want and be tax exempt  and there's a major market secret market  in children and that is the currency  that these people are operating in it's  way beyond drugs and it's how they  operate it's what they do and the UN got  caught and Hillary Clinton's deputy  Foundation had to change her name  this is Reuters mm-hmm smuggling kids  out of Haiti that were disappearing as  she got convicted changed her name and  now runs the database for missing  children in America now when they can  control who's doing what who's going  where okay and so that's what's so scary  and that's what gave Hillary all that  power and that's why is because these  people are super bad news and super damn  evil and and and and you think they have  like that that DMT connection with other  dimensions and they're having like other  information other technologies yeah  let's just say this reportedly you take  DMT and torture some kids to death  you're gonna be with the devil  mmm-hmm and I don't well I think you  know listen man look look look  I haven't been sober all my life and  I've taken drugs where I feel like I've  had I've been approached by a spirits  that necessarily weren't of the finest  kind and I told them is  we'll tell you I'm a play in the devil's  playground but I'd be damned if I'm  gonna live here this is not the person I  represent this is not the world that I  want to reside in you  I represent God because I was made in  the image of that's right and I feel  well especially once you had children  you probably didn't want to play in the  devil's playground anymore did you well  you know I don't want anything to do  with it hey I've seen some stuff too and  let me just tell you something let me  just tell you the closest thing what's  that movie that Johnny Depp's in works  like the ninth gate or the seventh gate  gospel where he has sex remember that  sex with the devil Tien and that's  actually what they said don't remember  the name let me show you those busters  man this man I fight on the side of  right man I was put here I was a soldier  I'm a soldier of God Hey look at my  security guys they're laughing at me I'm  a soldier I'm telling you I've never  been in telling you what the  establishment thinks I'm a soldier of  God so embarrassed you keep going hard  time get in there the devil the devil  will have whatever hand he chooses to  have in trying to coerce me however at  the end of the day I'm a soldier of God  because I was made in His image for me  to go against him is for me to go  against myself we're all made in the  image of God but you can still choose to  join Satan I ain't but see that's the  thing no I feel like there's a certain  weak broken spirit that must be required  in order to do so no I get it and I oh  hey cuz you've seen the other side now I  ain't seen other side give you  perspective I'm just telling you no no  no I have a strong sense of self and a  strength somewhere well a will exactly  somewhere inside of me you're an ear a  sentient entity that's eternal that has  that was made by God in God's image do  you have a seat of the universe in you  sure attend she a lady right to  basically do anything uh-huh in the time  of space but there is still that force  that wishes to enslave us all and  turn eyes towards its will absolutely  and I ain't going partially or  predominantly  because ain't nobody gonna make me be  nothing now I'm gonna be and here's the  bottom line  they try to control all these churches  to put out false info they try to have  all these religions but everybody knows  it's a fight between good and evil  everybody knows we're being tested on  this planet and everybody and the  mathematics show that there's all these  dimensions right and and they try to  make us atheist so that we don't even  know that the devil and God are real but  when you get around the globalist and  these powerful people they're obsessed  God is real they're obsessed with God is  real religion is fake yes God has  written those are fake systems to divert  you and keep you from hitting show God  is real religion is fake and the devil  even uses religion to control humans so  they can go against your knowing one of  these big churches that's where you feel  the devil hey what are you saying if you  can if you can cut to the picture of me  sitting in a mega church this Sunday you  will understand what he says is  absolutely true but I want to switch  gears just a minute let's talk about  when you did or didn't sneak into the  Bohemian Grove no I didn't say no all  right let's talk about but I'm gonna let  you think about it because I'm gonna  have another 1942 break  [Music] ",3
HzqztzNtI34,"but I gotta say something about this guy  he is a true renaissance man okay he is  a jiu-jitsu virtuoso all right  reinventing the martial art basically  getting some flack for it from some of  the traditionalist he's a coach in the  UFC he's doing music and he's also known  and this is one of the reasons I  gravitate prison-house the conspiracy  theorist because I don't want to say I'm  a conspiracy theories myself but I do go  around it so what the flat earth yeah  like a lot of people are like any really  but tell us why yes yes it's really  simple it's really simple they lied to  us about six moon missions the the  greatest technological achievement of  mankind they liked with six times fake  video fake pictures I don't believe  anything coming from mainstream  information science mainstream media  entertainment I think it's all bullshit  okay do you have any theories on what  happened in Las Vegas because I've seen  a lot of conspiracy theories revolving  around that that's all looks like a  false flag to me looks like a giant  cover-up are you because here's one  thing and I gravitate towards your  openness for these conspiracy theories  because I myself am somewhat of a  conspiracy theorist but do you do tend  to do that with every major event every  major event that's covered by like CNN  and all the major networks if they're  all covering the same thing you got to  look at that like a super suspicious  detective you're not you should be  looking in like hey this one might be  real they think they can't be lying  about everything you know you got to  look at it like this is probably support  where did all this down or suspicion  stem from was there something in your  life or something that you saw that just  made you really question media yes  well the first time I questioned media  has 15 and I was really into like  satanic speed metal underground Slayer  and my Kreator and Sodom real they were  they wrote about Satan in every song  okay and both as I'm 15 years old and I  know they're not really into  it's just I could it's just like a  doctor that's it's a director that's  into horror movies like did did the guy  who write The Exorcist was he really  satanic so we all knew it was just a  show but then on 20/20 they announced 15  they put on this this this episode where  they're accusing fans like Motley Crue  and Twisted Sister and Judas Priest of  being satanic and I was thinking I'm  like I'm thinking they got the wrong man  yeah it's not Twisted Sister how come  they're not talking about Slayer right  so at that point at that point I thought  and they have the PMRC these these old  ladies going how's your Pierce if your  kids are listening to Twisted Sister  they're probably satanic so right there  I realize wow this is ABC this channel  seven's 2020 and day of no clue so at  that point that was the beginning right  there and also you know finding out that  not everybody was Catholic I was brought  up and in Santa Ana California where  everybody in Santa Anas Catholic and  then when you find out when I was 11 and  I found out that there's other religions  like there's a puzzle I'm like what how  do we know that we're right I thought  everybody was Catholic that's what I'm  like oh my god could you have foreseen  that this this part of your personality  I mean your your regular and Joel Rogan  okay which is opened you up to a whole  new audience you're on shows you're on  podcast like Adam Jones's podcast which  is the chief conspiracy theory progress  who did you ever foresee that that would  become such a big part of your brand  because it's enough to say that you're  this jujitsu guy that you know we  invented the martial art coach um see  you guys  the the first band I was in was all cuz  I didn't know anything about conspiracy  this was in the 80s I was in a band  called resistance and it was all about  conspiracy but I didn't know there was  no internet he was the resistance  we didn't I don't know what the hell I  was talking about back then I just I  just knew that they were lying and I had  no proof I'm like I don't believe you  know you watch TV I believe though that  the earth is flat I believe I don't  believe what the mainstream was coming  from mainstream cosmology I don't  believe it  I'm just highly suspicious of it they  fake six moon landings you got to ask  yourself a question how many times do  they have to fake stuff like moon  missions before you don't believe  anything means six and some people could  be some people it could be 50 you know  what I mean but there's a documentary  you want it you want to the best  documentary on it's called the history  of Flat Earth  it's by Eric Dubay watch that it's on  YouTube that'll explain that it's not  I'm gonna watch it cuz I'm flattered if  the beta's have been going on for a long  time they've been trying to suppress it  so anything I want you to watch those I  want you to watch our channel if you  have DIRECTV's the NASA it's called  Earth cool if you use from the sacrum  from the space station that show the  curvature of the earth that's all with a  fisheye lens people want to believe they  take six more missions but people still  want to believe it look you're not gonna  make any money if you believe that right  he's just he's saying that they faked  the moon missions like how am I supposed  to know that six moon missions were  faked it just seen all the videos on  YouTube that show how they faked it I  don't believe it so then you're gonna  guess what yes but there's no definite  proof of either one there's massive  proof no but you can't you eight but now  I see it I would love to see it's not I  think that it's not definitely either  way but I will say this I want you to  keep looking into anything you're like  my favorite guests keep coming back I  want to see what the next you go from  one conspiracy theory to another so in a  few months you'll probably be obsessed  with something else bring them back  we'll talk about it you'll put someone  else  the flat earth one will talk about it  and congratulations you're successful  Tony Ferguson you're not a coach of a  UFC champ and you deserve to be the  coach man thanks a lot oh by the way we  talked about EDI Eddie Bravo  Invitational this weekend right not this  Sunday but next up because there's six  weeks on this October 22nd October 22nd  we're at the Orpheum in downtown LA you  can watch our UFC fight pass order on  pay-per-view inch by inch TV  [Music] ",3

what's the difference  between the Bohemian Grove and  Scientology because the same thing  you're saying about Bohemian Grove is  what people say about science let me  tell you okay I'm this movie Amy Rose  what Scientology wishes it was but this  is way beyond that  these are cults and let me explain  something what do you think happens when  you start investigating they send  somebody in to shoot stuff up then  they're blaming you on every channel I  was on every channel at that time so if  anybody names me for shooting anything  up guys know to do remember back in the  80s and 90s they say rap was making  people do that but the point is right is  it that's what they do  and they operate on fear I will give you  that the government or I want the powers  that be that want to control the way we  think behave and operate let me say this  money knows you're right let me say this  way a burrito let me say this way CNN  and the New York Times broke the story  saying that we were saying there was a  basement they were killing kids in there  we never we didn't say it they said it  then a guy goes in in my name and does  it to shut down our investigation of  Jeffrey Epstein okay and the WikiLeaks  and the real devil worshippers thank you  because Epstein wasn't just having sex  with kids they were doing rituals okay  and that's come out now but let's talk  about Jeffrey s let's talk about Jeffrey  Epstein because his mysterious suicide  his mysterious suicide has the nation in  are in shock let's get a coffee  [Music] ",3
ZCJJbDAWUeg,"Jeffrey Epstein he just committed  suicide  talk about killing who was tied to Trump  and acquaintance and the Clintons a  bunch of other people bunch of them all  the fuck is a billionaire a pedophile  I'll bet man for so long have you ever  cross paths with them hell no no no I  don't think so but it's funny though  like for the longest you hear this stuff  sound it's so outlandish from like  Epstein so even if shit were like pizza  gate and Haiti you know you hear like  man there's no that's it it's so dark  there's no way it can be true and I  would be reading this stuff and be like  something like again I'll be like I'm  not that much of a conspiracy theorist  to be like that this stuff they can't  really be trafficking little kids and  sleeping with I mean that's that's been  and still be billionaires and I'm like  this is truly Babylon if this is the  case and so I would never speak out  about it too much because I didn't want  people are you talking about like  there's no way let fucking Pizza game in  all that is shit and when you step back  and you start Pizza gay it's not a real  thing I mean but from Epstein with  Oliver gate was that what a little bit  the Clintons were trafficking like  underage kids through a kapitza  restaurant they had nothing to do with  nothing some guy actually showed up  there with a gun and got arrested and if  somebody tells you about the Epstein  shit and you'd be like man come on now  this billionaire is really taking and  what cuz I don't want to fuck it up but  someone that worked for him even on the  Child Protective Services side was  actually snatching those kids that were  supposed to be missing kids and  providing them to like that that shit in  itself sells fucking ridiculous  well you know what's even crazier is  that he was on suicide watch right he  kills himself while on suicide all right  and apparently no cameras captured it on  top of that  that doesn't come on out and I'm not big  on conspiracy theories right here  somebody get the Scooby Snacks that's  right the Mystery Machine  yo clearly he has information about a  lot of motherfuckers yeah and David  wanted him to die with that information  now he's dead and he's a billionaire  right like a few times over like let's  not act like like he wasn't one of the  cast that was supposed to be touchable  so when you hear about this type of  stuff going on in in our society on the  elite aspect well I would not believe  all that it's others I didn't want to  believe I had heard about that shit the  same way I'm like man I don't have no  true proof and I'm still I'm focused on  the community I only want to uplift and  speak positive so when I would hear shit  like that and I couldn't tangibly  understand it it just sounded like  another one of those conspiracy theories  and for that to actually be truly and  you make you step back buddy well fuck  what else is real about this shit listen  you're a pedophiles out there  point-blank period some man Manik some  men are pedophiles they're into  underaged girls and boys sometimes both  and having a lot of money to a certain  degree so I said access to access I  always say and uh you know my thing is  like this case had been going to five  ten years the fact that he was still in  America kind of blows my mind because  you would think he would just go  somewhere else where he thought he was  untouchable yeah well you got touched  how do you good he thought he could pay  it off yeah and I bet you he was paying  it off for a while until you pissed  somebody off  and as I we going we're gonna sacrifice  you well our kill he's currently locked  up remember we've been talking about  this for a while now since our last  interview he actually got locked up  right no bond still different cities  catching cases there's no catching cases  I remember someone posted a meme and had  this dude like looking pissed off and  the caption was when you won when you've  won the jail talent show two years in a  row  our killer shows these go he's gonna win  the talent show  they got my man Bill Cosby in their  holding court yeah I mean like I mean  his was it you know any pedophilia but  it's just as dark and it's like shit man  what do what are we supposed to say  about the people that were placed in  front of us in such a positive light  that have all of these dark demons this  is just no longer an environment where  you could really hide what you do which  is beautiful you fucking love this  motivates you to be a better person it's  called a paradigm shift even to the  point you know what's crazy I remember  like I remember I was getting into  conversation with someone and I  mentioned I forgot what it was like  let's just say I mentioned the Bowflex  or something yeah the Bowflex workout  all right and I look out my phone and  there's a Bowflex ad and so I'm like  these folds are definitely listening to  you yeah yeah I'm a hundred percent sure  of this I've seen it happen time and  time again these phones are listening to  you imagine all the shit that you say to  yourself like man what kill this  motherfucker bow recorded said to the  media sent to authority center whatever  like no I was just talking to myself  doesn't matter you just admitted to  wanting to murder somebody I love like I  love it because it allows you to to be  your truthful self even if you don't  want to like your Bible says what goes  on in darkness will come to light like I  truly believe that there's you got to  operate in the life man and and  everything that's dark is gonna come  forth and we're gonna have to deal with  it in these harsh ways that we dealing  like that's why like mad at Donald Trump  because he's bringing all of that  darkness to the forefront and and we got  to deal with it as a nation and how we  deal with it is gonna show the  importance of our humanity ",3
BjCq335Y7jM,"and to be honest with you I felt like  that election was the worst decision one  would have to make you know what I mean  I don't think that election really gave  the America that's what I'm telling you  yeah you couldn't yeah you know what I'm  saying is like fucked up and fucked up  er you know what I'm saying and I um  the thing the Hillary had that was the  edge on her that everyone wanted to see  the first female president sure I'd love  it to be a woman that didn't a war  monger and a lion which well lay in bed  with the Russians massively oh my god  speaking of the rest so look we talked  about your contribution to the election  of the president what about the Russians  you're a conspiracy theorist what  happened there oh I got to tell you  that's a case of Hillary did uranium one  gave him 25 percent of our uranium she  was in deep trouble Robert Muller had  been the bagman delivering him uranium  on the tarmac she'd done a legal deal  with the Russians but she was Secretary  of State so they knew that Trump was  able to use that against him so they  sent in all these agents to try to set  up Trump and his people to make deals  the Russians but they didn't really  exist also you can go to Russia and buy  box of the Internet advertising 80% of  it that was done was for Hillary and so  that was all just a big smokescreen to  make it look like the election of Donald  Trump wasn't legitimate yeah and that's  why the whole thing's turned out to be a  hoax it's like Brett Kavanaugh a Supreme  Court justice  two women have just gone public and said  we were never called we never met him  these are the women that were saying  these were the women they were saying in  the news he had sexually assaulted it  was just made up so you say brick have  another sexual assault in no way that's  what you're saying in every case except  for bilasa are you saying brick Kevin  assaulted know what I'm saying that that  absolu they've had no proof there were  no branch 11 assaulted no bad yeah 35 40  years ago there's no police reports no  witnesses at the time and almost all the  people have said that they were  threatened to say it or that they were  paid to said almost listen because it  said furball Ozzie Ford okay belies it  forward all right the evil chipmunk  whatever this this this this this this  bottle of water you're drinking  it's approximately eight ounces correct  if I drop a fraction of an ounce of shit  water in there I'm not gonna drink you  dig what I'm saying you dig it I'm  saying so one little drop of shit water  makes an entire bar but there's water  undrinkable does it matters due process  I ask does it net but you're famous what  are you gonna do 30 years from now  people lie don't lie about you  I ain't rate nobody I ain't rape nobody  everything that's done around me and is  done and my company and my pressure  saying is all fair and and and and  consistently I've never sweat but if you  look at me you see I ain't got to you  look at Brett Kavanaugh you know but it  under due process this is just me under  the process you can speak it as a play  you can't forty years later when you  don't have any witnesses and it turns  out just this week they did it to Bill  Cosby how come they can't do it to Brett  Kavanaugh they did it to be a Cosby I  don't think Bill Cosby deserves to be in  prison I've said that and people  criticized before they don't have any  but these women go up to these hotel  rooms and their Playboy Bunnies and then  they claim 40 years ago or 30 years ago  he drugged him okay I mean they listen  to due process that's what their statute  limitations right you're supposed to  make the listen I had NPR uh-huh go and  interview people from high high school  okay they said that I beat up 30 nerds  started a fight with a nerd I wasn't a  bully right that's a damn lie so you  know when you get lied about like that  you start not believing the stuff you  see out there where they don't have any  proof and there's the thing thing I can  say you just raped me in that bathroom  if I don't have proof I don't have it  you didn't rape me in the bathroom I  appreciate you saying you know what I'm  saying I understand where you coming  from and what you're saying but you do  know that there are some there's some  tangled webs of misconception sure can I  just say there's stuff absolutely all  the studies show that 3G 4G and 5g give  humans and  they tested on giant brain tumors okay  it's true that breast cancer that is  estrogen positive is up over 3,000  percent who and it was incredibly rare  everywhere and took glyphosate was put  out there right and now we know and they  found in court they found scientifically  they knew right that glyphosate mm-hmm  from that big company right was giving  people cancer I was covering it 25 years  ago and getting threatened to shut up I  didn't shut up I had the scientists on  he grows prostate cancer  it grows regio 5g and glyphosate all of  it and so where do you find glyphosate  it's in every water table in the Western  world every water table it's in the  water  it's in the odds like fluoride okay  fluoride was used in the Soviet Union in  the water supply and forced labor camps  to make people docile and infertile so  right when the the Nazis and the  Russians started World War two were  allies they divided Poland this is all  in pulls approximately books right  Stalin gave Hitler the fluoride system  to suppress people right then in 1949  they start putting in our water there's  thousands of studies that lowers IQ  there are thousands of studies it  reduces fertility I'm not saying this  because you're an African American I  have that all the scientists on top  toxicology I want you to see it set for  whatever reason fluoride hurts women  right about three times less than men  because of women's blood-brain barrier  okay it hurts men three times more and  then it hurts black men twice what it  hurts any other man genetically so why  does it hurt black me and more  genetically that is on average and  that's in Harvard study but is there a  reason that's a gamma study just type in  fluoride hurts blacks more than than any  other group and men particularly okay  and it deals with some type of issue  with the blood-brain barrier and of  course that's all averages people pretty  close but there's different averages and  this and that and if you just look it up  you'll know it's really hitting black  people tell me fluoride on anyone any  male that drinks it lowers IQ massively  any Mayo any male not female women not  as much okay is there blood-brain  barrier they gotta be able to carry a  child they got a much stronger  blood-brain barrier  gotcha a woman's gotta be able to have a  baby with a different blood type that  that you know Pisa  probably sometimes crap center-right  okay and it's for me over the course of  that month of sweet crepes enter quite a  bit yeah yeah well I mean I mean that  route this really goes on I'm not  putting babies down I'm saying women any  doctor will tell you women aren't  tougher in a fist fight but women  gunshot wounds stab wounds starving  starving  any to poison it takes more poison to  kill a woman so women are as babies are  tougher okay and so I have daughters and  sons so I know the difference in in in  in female evolution versus male  evolution my daughter's they talked  sooner they walked sooner they were  potty-trained  sooner now once they get to be about I  say seven eight you know I mean it kind  of balances out a little bit you know me  based on how much time effort and energy  you've put into like you know what they  consume exactly but I'm saying if you've  got a white baby a brown baby a black  baby right you don't want to get before  I'd but if but but if they're a boy you  sure as hell don't want to give them to  them because how can you not give it to  them if that's the water just coming out  of you've gotta the filter it and it's  gonna be the proper type but just I  swear to god we considered how about why  speaking of babies yep  speaking of babies this is something  that's very very near and dear to me and  my concerns and things that I'm very  very very passionate about Vasa Nations  oh okay Vasa Nations what's with Vasa  Nations okay okay I believe and the  science is really obviously oh you don't  believe in science  going back 600 years ago in England they  learned how if a cow had smallpox you  wanted to give it to your kids when they  were healthy and said when they were  sick because if your kids were already  had the flu or cold and got it kill him  not a person at the time but if you gave  them smallpox on a toothpick to they  poked the pus and they'd stick it in  your arm you get a scar and most the  time you live you only died like three  percent of the time what yeah no I don't  want my baby having nothing to cause in  the doubt 1% of what you do I'm not  defending it I'm the guy that they try  to ban for saying this the inserts on  vaccines say they don't protect you and  they say they can kill you not the  factsheet if you gotta act for the ins  that comes in the package I'm getting  chills it so important my mom almost  died taking a flu shot my uncle almost  died taking a tetanus shot and they have  a secret vaccine fund speaking of Regan  this happened on the Regan where they  pay people off secretly if so many  millions were getting damaged from it my  grandmother who just died two years ago  at 92 she got a second round of polio  shots in 1955 and the doctor told her  you got polio and it almost killed her  from the vaccine so you're damn right we  have a government with a history of  objecting people with syphilis we in  vaccines absolutely why are we now gonna  trust them when they tell us that this  is great I don't people in the military  yeah where they had certain units when I  gave them the anthrax shots where people  died in almost every unit from the so  called anthrax shot so this is secret  government experimentation going on it's  not that it's not that vaccine science  is it real is it they're side effects  and they're jacking it with stuff and  90% of our vaccines are making comments  China I'm gonna tell you two things I'm  gonna tell you two things  that I find hard to believe about  vaccines or that confuse me about  vaccines first if the vaccines work and  my child haven't been vaccinated and  it's a classroom full of children that  have been vaccinated  why the hell does your kid gotta take it  we have to have a vaccine  why is my kid threatened to not be  admitted into class because he or she  doesn't have a vet seen if the other  children do have that scenes and the  vaccines actually work by the way you  just said it and I interrupted you say  it again if my child hadn't had a  vaccine but this vaccine works 100% of  the time it's safe and effective then  all these other kids are protected how  are they saying my kids bad and gonna  make their kids sick supposedly they're  protected because the truth is the flu  shots never been correct they've never  guessed the next year's mutation and if  you look at the studies taking one flu  shot doubles your chances Canadian study  for by the government 2008 doubles your  chance to take in the flu shot doubles  your chances of get  the flu the next year it's BS he lowers  your immunity and you can't trust these  companies this is true  and speaking of companies uh you know  Purdue Purdue who produces oxycontin and  like one of the largest distributors of  opioids and in this country which is  also one of the largest contributors of  the open the opioid epidemic they were  being sued they're being sued by two  thousand plus people victims that have  been affected by the drug and I believe  they were said to have been in  conversations to settle in the tune of  twelve billion now why is it that I just  hear that Purdue is looking to file  bankruptcy could you tell the people  what the strategy may be for that and  the impact it may have on the American  public  well sure what happens is once these  companies know they're about to lose  lawsuits they declare bankruptcy so that  they don't have to pay out all the money  so the people who actually did it get  away with it and a lot of those  companies their own documents will come  out their business plan is to make a new  more addictive opioid to beat all the  others and then they think by the time  that ever happens they'll just declare  bankruptcy and already moved it over  into other companies so I think you do  the answer yeah absolutely if you're  gonna tell the truth  know the truth I'm not saying I just  want does that mean you know we're  getting to know each other but  everything I mean I'm trying to be  truthful here absolutely and so I'll  give you that that actually some of the  things Trump has said I've been divisive  and and that was yeah I was just you get  so used to being attacked because I've  supported Trump he's just very affinity  but you know nobody's perfect and I  agree right is right in Rome to the left  of this  [Music] ",3
nBQ4Ao9V-lU,"because some other fuckers will say that you were allowed to leave because you agreed to do their dirty work after you left oh no I never I never did I didn't really not that's what I say I would say okay well if I broke into here and I was caught and I was questioned if I was allowed to stay if I wasn't apprehended then I kind of agreed to be a Fed so you did sneak into a Bahamian Crowe that's not it okay so what's back there well it's a 2700 Acre beautiful redwoods 2,700 acres and it looks like Yosemite it's the biggest redwoods you've ever seen but there's not tourists and what would be the purpose for such a facility for searches well the history is no not gonna Mark Twain and others when they were in San Francisco bought the land and set it up as an artist retreat it was very very liberal and then William Howard Taft around the turn of the last century about a hundred twenty years ago they came in and bought it the president bought it with a consortium do they bat with the American public's money no no a bunch of robber barons bought it okay guys then they threw out a lot of the artists but kept some of them okay and then it was just a place to you know let their hair down and do all sorts of stuff and also stuff used to give me an idea you know even back then there was a you know gay stuff going on all six can i but they'd also down the road they built a whole camp and stuff where they wouldn't the women in but they ship in a bunch of hookers and then and then and then they put a railway into it so orgies orgy job but then over time they brought a german death cult over same on they have a skull and bones and ah skullenbones the Bilderberg Group and such yeah and which those aren't a german chancellor came out and he wrote a book men in power as a political retrospect name of the Prime Minister my brains failing but it's political minutemen empowers both my perspective all right and he said oh we have our own rituals in Germany but we really like the ones we do out there and so by by the turn of the knot this decision perform 120 years ago it became super early expected it still took a few weeks to go across the country from DC or New York and so they stay sometimes a whole month once they got there okay and so the robber barons the most rich people and you know the Rockefellers all of us sort of going there and then they started doing druidic and Germanic rituals and reportedly even human sacrifice there and then kids started disappearing in the area it was being imported you know over hundred years ago the kids were missing hmm quite a bit they were missing children seem to be the threat pettite of narrative yeah so it seems like children or innocence the fuel so there's like a miniature sexy Netflix thing that's excellent they literally take the innocent death wing and they they suck its energy you say the new wood the new Dark Crystal mojo is an allegory of exactly what they're doing and so so I got contacted by a reporter with channel 4 and he said I've got people that work there and they want it to be exposed but we can't have the liability and I know you've snuck into some places that's an investigative reporting on some military drills that were practicing around people up and stuff we've you know we got your ticket and got you you know the inside deal you still get arrested by the Secret Service because presidents people go there but will you sneak in and I said yes so you were prompted by a like a facility or a group yes and it turns out who was this group again turns out it was the Democrats basically because Bohemian Grove Bohemian Grove is mainly Republicans okay and so I'm like I mean I'm 45 now this was in 2000 I mean I was a lot younger okay and I later learned I was I was set up so instead of getting into the occult part of it let me hit this first so I sneak in I get in there secret service questions we have been given pass codes so what club I'm in but still they act suspicious so I climb under one of these houses log cabins until it gets dark I'm supposed to be there on July 15th to catch the cremation of care a mock human sacrifice of a child in front of this giant owl it also doubles as a giant bull Molech where they sacrifice kids an entire in the middle Asian so so that our represents the sacrifice of children yes well and also the same owl that is present in Adult Swim say now that is present even in ovo for Drake in his record label but that owl you saying whether it is knowingly unbeknownst to the person who uses it it represents the sacrifice of children well it any symbol could have multiple uses but it is in the National Press Club symbol and the press has also gone there secretly so it's part of them being compromised and yes the reason they worship the owl in that particular form because it gave me nothing and Greek mythology knowledge and things like that is that the owl is a bird of prey America is a bald eagle and you know Iran is an eagle and you know everybody likes Eagles okay it's up there conceived it's it's smart it you know but you can't see it the Owls the rain oh now it's bigger than the bald eagle until one I mean it's it's metered hell it's got big old eyes and it can see in the dark so see it's got knowledge it can see you like special forces but you can't see it well you're in the dark it walks right over and just grabs you and eats you you can't do it a I'm thinking it kills other birds it kills Eagles at night the Eagles get down that nest at night they fear the allottee owls come in they hunt other other royal birds you would call them so so so these are the great terrain with it what kind of terrain would it be where an owl would hunt Eagle a place just like those redwoods so so it's the ultimate predator but nobody's got the owl as their as it's a national symbol so in the Bohemian and the Bohemian Grove is where Isles Hunt Eagles place all terrain sand so it's all a play on that like a we're the real bird again the only we only operate them so you think this American bird is the birds you need to be looking at for but in actuality is really this way yeah it's a our national birds Millia great or now twice the size of a bald eagle and I mean have you ever seen one what did you see when you broke in let me tell you something here you know awesome we've got these great horned owls you got in there too you'll be walking sometimes in the woods you look over at the edge and there's one sitting up the top of tree up out of the brush just look at it it's kind of like that big yellow eyes yeah it looks like that man it's scary now anyways it's one scary things you ever sees when you look over you feel looking you look over there's that great horned owl those big only alive but that's what you saw well they've got a 50-foot tall stone one and they bring a child to it and then they have the priest all out in front of it as you see it bring it's do you see a child they brought a child in effigy and I saw that yeah I in out I crawled out but then later I learned what happened wait a minute so you actually heat out you looked and you saw a child be brought to a 50-foot statue of an owl well they said it was a mock child but yes they said it was a month child but the thing is they put all their troubles on the child and then the deity and at that time Walter Cronkite was still alive he did the voice submit but but Theater all comes from rituals so theater the priests will get up and do theater as part of the rituals so we're in the church out under the redwoods around this little pond there in front of it it was people who broke in with you no no there's all the the members are watching but you say we you said we were no no we're all there I'm there with the people watching it and it's you're in hiding no I've come out at night I get in during the day they questioned me it's still three hours till night I cover it all my film dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove it's free online there's another one called order of death that that has the latest and again people can find it all free they've tried to take it off YouTube so you snuck into Bohemian Grove you were basically caught and questioned and allow to stay to witness a ritual I was about to say I didn't you're really smart or did you do your homework because I I didn't do my I didn't understand this till later okay so yes I'm given a passcode all right I think we'll the Secret Service questions me mm-hmm that I acted confidently just let me do it but the truth was they were just going through a checking everybody and they had the head sheriff there and they were looking at me and they let me go I climb up underneath a log cabin wait till it gets dark starting to get dark I come out there all feasting under these giant redwood tree feasting what do you mean we'll be there they're all a big huge picnic tables under giant redwoods like a cathedral but woody like printer at any national park you've seen I don't know that mean they're out there eating steaks whatever I'm not getting down there with them I come down out of the hills I didn't see what they were eating did you know that they weren't eating chewed no no no no this is all art title this is only the first gate because they bring thousands of guests to this about a thousand members I bring about a thousand yes 2,700 square acres but let me expand on that in the size of a fucking capital city yeah and so and so it's a mock human sacrifice they say mock human well and I'll describe that so me wait a minute who who would find it necessary to mock a human sacrifice well sure yeah mock has that well meaning as well but a mock means simulated okay who would have it useful to them and beneficial to there's a mock-up to simulate well they're doing it to see is the guest they brought are into it but the members the members are really getting off on it going while they do it and then they bring in a Hearst they bring in AAT so that must mean that they bring they bring back and draw on a black wagon with it with a child in a coffin okay live-chat they don't know it I was I was 150 yards away okay in the woods watching this with with the people down below me but were you 150 yards away in the woods this is like a devil worshiper movie where the kids climb over the hill and watch a human sacrifice I understand so this really happened I understand that's what she described it I'm just trying to clarify for my own understanding listen so you're saying you 150 yards away hiding in the woods watching a mock sacrifice yes of simulating a simulated sacrifice of a child and a black wagon brought in in in in a in a casket all right I understand that part now what I'm trying to say is earlier you said you were questioned yes okay so you said you were questioned before the Sun went down okay so if your question before the Sun went down how did you end up being 150 yards away in the woods still wise good question I mean I made the film there's two films they're free online dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove remember this is something a little hidden camera you know it's color back I don't know there but I got you here so I off the field there we go I go up to the end of the road they've got checkpoints and guards mm-hmm they've got a parking area right off here there's like a little swamp right here where they have these open back trucks that come and pick people up that work there and take them in or take members I crawl through I sit there and act like I'm in a car wait till some of these old men start going to get on the back of this flat back deal they we go rolling through I'm dressed like a yuppie they let me get in then I get off I start walking up the hill and I had a map that down here was the water and where the Moloch was the owl my luck's also a bullet has little meanings I go up in the hills I'm trying to you know get away from folks the will you pursued I want to tell you they're there uh some some some some some Hispanic gentlemen ride by on a Cushman work card they whistle at me and they say oh yeah they start laughing going you know there's one of the you know there's one of the prostitutes I was like you know 27 years old I'm saying is listen they didn't pursue you for being a bogey they didn't know they didn't know I get in I get out I see some guys happen whistle at me okay dessert at you in the wilderness no no no it's it's roads these give these woods so you get in you get past the checkpoint down here is where they basically like hiding behind a stop sign no I'm just walking like I own the place walk huge walk by and whistle at me and tell me they wanna have sex with me it's very gay okay okay I get up at the top of the hill okay a sheriff these sheriff a little earner walks up with Secret Service and they say who are you with I said I'm here with the what was the I'm here with the hillbillies and that's actually the camp of the group of the bushes I forgot his accent they go really I know yeah so I go on up all of a sudden I got a little side road I see a police car drop by I say I better hide I climb up underneath nobody one of these log cabins and I wait till it starts getting dark okay okay then I get another tape in my little DV cam little deal my little fanny pack that's you which is super obvious and then I sneak down I'm going down this nest stylish enough no gay men right listen I'm going down the hill I'm going down the hill and then I'm going down the hill and there they are down there with all these big tables there's photos this online that they've since released it's all eating food under the redwoods I go down here I get in position in the woods they all start leaving they go around they go around look at me they go around and get around the the the pool okay the pool is in like a like a pool of swimming pool no it's a joke it's not artificial I mean it's like a pond or lake right there okay it's like a long reflecting pool in front of the owl alright I kind of hang out people are already there waiting on the edge is it a fountain no it's a pool there's bats flying around grabbing bugs absolutely tons of bats so there's all these bats flying around eating bugs it's beautiful night the sun's almost down it's a beautiful night with tons of bats flying around if you go up in the Northern California there's a ton of bats in the summer flat around Edinburg if you look Austin there's like millions of them okay there's just bats everywhere continuous so there's a little there called Mexican brown bats that's a species there's all these Mexican brown bats flying around and Magno species is because Austin has a record number of as well that's what you live in the southern part of United States in the West and we're sitting there and this is what the with state this is Northern California okay say listen Toma County okay you can go there on July 15th to be a bunch of protesters oh no what guess what a pass well and I'll tell you a story I'm walking by and I never really told I've told this once but I don't like promoting the stuff just from either sighs all right Danny Glover's there oh shit and he's talking to folks and everything and then I'm walking by to go down when they're breaking up from the from the meal to go down to the pool right oh the owl said and I hear some old men look about 98mm call him going what's that guy leaping and we're doing here so actually did hear that while I was there and Danny Glover heard them no no I'm like I'm crying to like not be seen here and there's Danny Glover and then it was Bill Clinton's top advisor later I saw him well most powerful guys in DC Jordan whatever his name was there those launch of black guys I saw em and the dirty Glover was there an actor and I heard yeah and I heard just I was like that's any glove I'm trying to not be seen him in the crowd he's all racist stuff there but you still saw black people did so really saw art racism even exists in like Satanism yes I mean I'm just telling you I'm lying within Satanism I'm like they're standing I'm like saying there's gaining that shit to me is bewildering even if we have all come together to agreed to worship a dark being by the name of Satan even if we've come to do all of these things there is still a dividing class and people still will call me a nigger we can't just all be Satan worshippers you know what I'm saying I think I don't think Danny Glover I still am I not in a superficial extraterrestrial outside of my human form being when I become so I'm still considered a nigger even well Jim I only told that because I mean I get knowing you're being targeted and then one day it pointed out so people stopped doing it right I'm just getting the fact that I only brought that up because it's true and that was something that happened I mean I appreciate you bringing it up because it provides a certain level of insight but I listen I don't want to surrender Danny Glover no we were not slandering Danny no you're not because you're not even saying that he's there I'm gonna take it as though you look like any lover and who looked like dad but I want to be clear I looked it up later yes but let me tell you when I grand new charlton heston he went he wasn't bad and I also loved you know of course one of the greatest actors of all time Clint Eastwood Clint Eastwood is a member what I'm trying to explain is what is the purpose of the group it's all thinly veiled it's started by Mark Twain but what's their mission those do they get all the top actors and they get the top musicians the Grateful Dead is played there and a lot of them aren't getting what this ritual is it's a Faustian German death cult ritual mask what's their mission statement they're their mission statement is weaving spiders come down here and forget about the cares of the world and do basically a voodoo ritual but don't say that from Africa that's just a common term of where you put something on to something else like these have spirit senators in Old Europe and in England where they have somebody where somebody died you put a piece of bread on their stomach and a senator would come and believe that they ate some of the sins and take some of the bad mojo that's basically the same as voodoo and so they do voodoo there and it's a ritual where you put all your cares on to this child that you give the idol and they take it very seriously but the way it was described to me is a lot of people to go to its place to party hang out talk about stuff not everybody's having sex with dudes you know there's a bunch of female that I'm sure yeah I'm sure if you want simplicity if you care about pussy you can get too well don't they keep the women in a whole bunch of nice little hotels literally at the end of the street so about 400 yards like the women aren't invited says no no Janet yeah about 400 times you got to leave the Richards like go back and get you simplicity there's a golf course and there's about ten little motels and man you walk in there they got jets Lana from all over the world that done all the top hookers and porn stars are there yeah they're all just 400 yards away sort of messy why weren't you arrested I am NOT confessing here because I didn't know they're still yours later I'm gonna tell you you you saw it that I'm not kissing your ass man I'm impressed because I don't unless you've heard me tell this before did you know that I've explained that I was Senate oh shit I heard no okay I'm impressed all right I only figured this out years later okay there's a really nasty dude named Jon Ronson I should even give him attention or people you know he's nasty I'm like I don't know like like if you're entering a harbor you know they put a buoy where there's rocks I believe his name out no no II do what you want the guy that acts with this fake little liberal loving guy from England and all this stuff yeah he's the guy that I'm there covering our everybody got murdered at Waco and I'm there at 60 minutes is covering it this is like in 1998 he comes at me goes Alex have you heard of Bohemian Grove where they do rituals and all this and I said I don't believe all that stuff Bank and I didn't believe that he goes no Alex I'm with world of 1 to channel 4 and I know a lawyer in the town and they think you're the one that could blow it wide open others have been arrested let me give you a file he gives with this file always color copies of magazines and articles for 30 years and all the arrested CBS flying helicopters over nobody can get in and so he says one of the being a year but that's like two years oh good I'll pay you and I'll get you in and I know the workers are gonna help you so one side but then he tells me you've got to sign a dream italic so sure that I'm going to sneak in after you if you're successful but I'll get sued because I'm with the big broadcaster you've got to videotape it and give it to me and promise to never tell that's all I kept do me so I guess what we call cap well what's captain can you say cat what does cap cap see ap yeah cap is basically when someone is either lying to get you off of figuring their bullshit out or exaggerating the truth in an excessive manner that is cap that's what I feel like what he told you as you described would be well I didn't figure it out till later cuz I was like I don't know I'm 45 now I'm mm how old was I mean I was like I was like 25 26 oh okay so I'm going in there and I looked on the radio like four five years that time and I was I mean and and so they knew I'd snuck on some military bases and and done some stuff and so they they knew I'd gotten footage and so I go in there but he comes in behind me with the lawyer who it turns out was with the group so this was some weird revelation of the method but later I thought it was them letting me in it wasn't they got really pissed turned out Harry Shearer you know a famous comedian and actor he was somehow involved with Ronson and they believe they can only make a movie about it and and other things once they had gotten footage but they wanted to use me as the puppet cute or or the drone or the decoy to go in and get it so I go in I get the footage I get it to him they put it out all over the world it's a big hit and three years later I get calls he's on c-span with Brian lamb saying Alex wasn't the one that snuck in he I'm the one that did it so then he's on coast to coast to him that night Mel show we think he was there as well no he was there he was he made me sign an agreement that he was gonna pay me to fly there give me the contacts and get me in with workers there but really it was people involved in managing it but not the members it was Democrats in the locals trying to set up the Republicans hoping I would get dirt on the Democrats behind or what should probably mi6 so I mean the British mi6 was the difference in Hemet so mi6 is the British and that's the British CIA yeah yeah okay cool so the British CIA and the repented and the Democrats they were behind all this that is I know it was a setup but I mean come what you think so so and this is a guy that you don't wrote all those movies like many stare at goats and a whole bunch of other stuff but the point is is that he's a disinformation operative so I go in he says I'll try to get in later with the lawyer and I'm able later that night after I get out he comes out and says no I was there - do you have the footage I'm like yes okay there's just blown away that it's happening all the rest of it and I later thought oh they they knew I was going in and the Secret Service just let me but no I was given real Pascoe's on the people inside that wanted me to get the footage for another faction if I exposed this other arm of the cult where they basically Epstein takes you to an island to compromise you in weird sex and stuff they were taking people to believe me and Grove to compromise them who weren't in the cult yet so it's basically like a cult feeder okay and so what made me mad about this individual was he made me swear to never say he went in or that I had a deal to get in the footage from the beginning and then when it became so famous he got mad and was like I made Alex Jones I made him so famous which was even true but it did may be even more famous it exploded he then turned around and said I really snuck in and got it all Alex Jones didn't and just basically burned me on that TV show and that radio show I called in to coast to coast am with George Noory this is like in 2000 and my god it's gotta be 13 years you know that was 2004 2003 times before I forget yeah mm three or four you can go find that original Coast coast am no one and it's hard tell stories there's so much to go over but nothing he was on the show saying the same thing but I knew the show so I called the producers said let me on he starts apologize and once I get on air with him okay and said oh yeah Alex actually I did pay you to go in there and but he was telling the world that I was a liar and that and that and that he had gone and got in the footage what it's clearly me in the videos and me getting it all guess what the fact that he admitted that on camera in this document it works to you advantage to sure I just don't think like that like a snake and he's the guy that didn't did this fake NPR story that I beat up all these nerds in high school in Dallas and then they they kidnapped me and tie me up and knock my teeth that's what the book the the the the moral of the story is he's not here well store always a goddamn liar but he's not here on on expeditiously yeah you are I'm Stan and why are you here I want to know let me ask you that when Isis questioned you guys come on so do you think the Bohemian Grove let me in or I think I mean he obviously got me in but it was another group a separate group that was one in dirt on the Republican because they kept asking me to try to get dirt on you know I'm not defending the Republicans I'm exposing but you're asking me to kind of form it well you smelled it out that I was let in which I think I was I mean I think that it had to be a reason that you know I'm sure they have security I'm sure they have cameras already have infrared you know all kinds of shit that would detect even kind of heat-seeking night-vision gone to shit and I'm sure they had motherfuckers riding around on a TV look I'm sure that shit is just as secure as the border so what was the point I can't you have way more you have far more experience on the subject I mean seriously I was I was 25 I'd be far I'd be remiss to even try to guess but it took me that was that was 19 years ago it took me 10 years even figure it out that than that I would that I was used well I mean listen far be it for me to say what is it is because some other fuckers were saying that you were allowed to leave because you agreed to do their dirty work after you left oh no I never I never did I didn't that that's what I say I would say okay well if I broke into here and I was caught and I was questioned if I was allowed to stay if I wasn't apprehended then I kind of agreed to be a Fed no I thought I was legitimately sneaking in there and I never figured out between talking about you sneaking in we talking about how you got out I mean I walked right out the front that's what I'm saying if anybody else was to sneak in somewhere and get caught I don't think they walk out but you see that's the thing if I'm working for them I don't even know it well that makes a lot of sense too that makes no sense if it wasn't what I just said it could have been that you would not really expect it to be there in the first place but I tell you but expanding on there could go back and forth about that all day we don't really know the answer to it because you if you can't tell me the answer I damn sure can't eat all I know is he had pass codes into it and I got the footage for him so they wouldn't get sued and then he turned around later and then tried to change the story but it was stupid cuz everybody saw the footage right so it was just bizarre I don't know I know that he had contacts with not just the lawyer was security okay well and so yes they somebody in that organization let me in and let me get back out and people were always saying that did you really sneak in there cuz if they let you in did you really sneak in they I mean they have arrested other people they questioned me I had the passcode that's what I'm telling you so so you knew you had a pass code before you snuck in yeah no he said we've got this lawyer that works there so you knew you weren't really sneaking in you probably could have walked straight through the front gate with the passcode no no it was it was if you got questions so but if you walk through the front gate and get questioned and you give them this passcode they grant you entry but they didn't question me at the gate but you bypassed the gate because you should never seen yes but there was another gate another you driving through this so you made it through one gate and then you didn't make it through another gate is that what you're saying no they we just rolled through the next game okay there's footage of all this I know because when you tell me you're smoking it that tells me I did not I did not attempt in any form of granted entry that's nothing over/under sure I'm the one telling you that I think they let me in you're convinced you're convincing yourself of what I just I know but you know they let you in no I do not know your stuff an hour later when I say you it is a like philosophical you not you personally but one would one would know they have been let in if they cross yes they came and recruited me through an operative of but I'm not sure what's great when you actually made your way onto the grounds if you made your way on to the ground through a gate a security protected gate that would tell me yeah you been letting well let me go further there's another chapter you didn't sneak in then Brad were lady then Brad Metzler welcome what will our met sir he has you know that he writes his best-selling books he's got a show on History Channel over a decade later they say we want you to go back to Bohemian Grove oh you went back wait it was on History Channel I was a discovery and and it gets crazier he's crazier we're there at this old theater in the town right there and they've got the original alien from the movie aliens there and the guys wearing a CIA hat who's the director of the show and they're doing this big program I swear to god he said they have the alien from the movie alien is this like the real guy you saying that wasn't that wasn't see I got eight-foot rubber suit ok but you sure it was a rubber suit no they told me you're sure I don't know but you can't believe what it was really obviously this was on TV he put up details so whoa he was walking and talking he was a human on the wall what do you think of this and he pulls back the curtain ok ok ok ok people are all really creepy well wait a minute they had a full bar downstairs I feel like he was testing you to find out if you were creeped out by the 8-foot supposedly PLAs I'm scared now it could have been a fucking carcass well listen let you could have been an alien carcass let's go further so then they're shooting all day with me in there alright and then I go downstairs there's a full bar and the bartender starts threatening me he goes you know I played naked bongos George Herbert Walker Bush there and you're saying we're satanic I say fu is the whole town's run by him it's a cult and so they're actually people who live there and work there and they all love it anyway so he goes he goes I know you're speaking in what's the population of this town I don't know it's it's uh it's on the Russia level below 10,000 it's below 10,000 okay it's very it's on the Russian River so this guy says to me okay he goes you know I know you're sneaking in there again today mmm-hmm is that good call them and have you arrested but I'm not and then I noticed the directors laughing at me so all of a sudden I get in these canoes with their camera crew and it said if you get in canoes yeah instead of going in the front gate I swear to god it's all true there's all video of it and instead of go on the front gate they want me to go up to the back end of it where I've shot video before from this overlooking point okay when I went up that hill and hid out when I came back out I shot down and so they keep going and I'm the only supposed to show me where I went how they can go up yeah and and and all of a sudden they go no Alex you've got to go come on come on and I went no I'm staying below the waterline I'm not violating this place I'm not gonna violate and trespass twice and as soon as I start walking back they go freeze police and guys start running out with guns I go fuck you I run jump into the fucking canoe run from them and don't get shit no listen listen they start chasing me they don't shoot they got cars across the other side don't I jump off and swim with my cell phone out call my crew members to come pick me up alright okay this is this happen no gunner that's putting the show no good now another show they had me running from the police right and the security yes they all get arrested but let out the next day right and when I saw those please no because they're all friends with the bushes I'd already knew this right okay this guy writes books with the bushes I knew what it was okay they were literally this time right I guess pissed at the other group whatever group that is in the Illuminati and wanted to bust me okay but correct me if I'm wrong now that's my life I guess where I got you but correct me if I'm wrong still no gunshot no okay but here's the difference that is the quintessential definition a white privilege because cuz hey my motherfucking ass got cold anywhere near there at the bar at the gate in the canoe no no the bar was is an old theater in town the bars on theater in town I don't give a damn where I was when you said that they did when you said that that that bartender had kind of snarled at you oh he told me I've that motherfucking bartender would a bust off caps at me man that shit would have been you know what I'm telling you is is that I mean I knew do you never knew that wide net sir whatever famous works with George W you but it was all a big joke yeah I understand yeah yeah yeah I and I appreciate you for that insight because most of us my people would not have the opportunity to even you know you know YouTube's gonna do yeah I want viewers to do this please okay so I'm not allowed to be on YouTube go find go find the Bohemian Grove special from history or discovery or whatever it is well somebody type in Alex Jones Brad Matt sir mysteries or whatever and he did shows with the bushes but what I'm gonna do huh what you won't do what you want to people to do I want them to take everything I've said here for this and like you don't find the footage you put it to it I'm not making this up and somebody can find that old theater will be actual it's funny you trust me they go pick this shit apart because we think it mean that alien it's funny you said that I'm not just kissing your ass well now look at that thing I remember I remember Otto didn't take a photo I do have a foot on the phone somewhere I remember the alien from the movie yeah [Music] ",3
z-MIuz6hfZg,"hi my angels its Haley Reis and today's  video is one that I've been meaning to  make for longer than you guys could even  imagine but on the same token I've been  a little nervous to make the Illuminati  has fascinated me for years and I've  watched countless conspiracy theory  videos on it I've watched a ton of  interviews and a bunch of videos that  basically point in the direction of the  Illuminati is still existing so it's  always been a subject matter that I've  really wanted to dive into here on my  channel but with that being said because  I've been so into the Illuminati for so  long and I've really done a lot of  research into the Illuminati I knew that  if I was going to make a video like  today's video I was gonna have to go all  in and put everything out on the table  and talk about everything that I've  learned and researched and all of the  knowledge that I've accumulated over the  years which can be super freaky when you  think about the fact that conspiracy  theorists have mysteriously turned up  dead after learning such information so  before I get into today's video and  diving into all that is the Illuminati I  want to put a quick disclaimer right  here just stating that this is all a  conspiracy theory none of this  information other than what has been  proven historically is factual and it is  all based upon conspiracy so don't come  at me don't need to be assassinated I  definitely don't need to be watched all  is good in my world but today we are  going to be diving into what the  Illuminati is exactly and everything and  anything to do with it one thing that I  want to make very clear and something  that I really want to take note on at  the very beginning of this video is that  upon doing my research and by the way I  have done more hours than you could  imagine of research on this subject  matter  there really isn't that much on it  there's no real tell-all video there's  also no real factual information  and one thing that I really want to note  which is common in the world of  conspiracy is that every avenue that I  headed down the kind of seemed like it  was putting towards evidence would be  countered by an article completely  opposing to what I just read it's almost  as if something or someone or perhaps  the Illuminati doesn't want you to get  any sort of evidential leads this was  one of the most difficult things for me  to research which I found interesting  considering the fact that the Illuminati  is one of the biggest conspiracy  theories of all time so without further  ado let's dive right on into this this  is going to be a lengthy video so I hope  that you guys have a drink of choice or  a snack on hand because we are going to  dive into everything that could cover  the possible bases and I do want to note  that this is a part one of a part three  series I'm embarking on this week of  conspiracy theories and all things to do  with this stuff so if you guys are new  to my channel and this kind of thing  interests you make sure you click that  subscribe button and turn your bell on  because I'm brewing up some interesting  stuff this week so the way that I've  decided to kind of break this video up  is by beginning with what people believe  the Illuminati is now then diving into  what the Illuminati actually  historically was then diving into all of  the symbolism surrounding it and the  conspiracies not only surrounding the  Illuminati itself but pop culture  so let's first and foremost dive into  what exactly people believe the  Illuminati is now so the Illuminati is  said to be a secret society which  essentially is said to rule all that we  are it is said that those who are in the  Illuminati are a part of or creating  what is known as the New World Order the  New World Order will be a government  holding executive and sole power over  the world essentially like world  domination type thing it is said that  those high up in power in the Illuminati  are a part of or in favor of this New  World Order now this range is from but  is certainly not limited to those in  politics those and jobs of power  celebrities and it's even sad  that those Impreza dents II are a part  of it all we have before us the  opportunity to forge for ourselves and  for future generations a new world order  a world where the rule of law not the  law of the jungle governs the conduct of  Nations when we are successful and we  will be we have a real chance at this  new world order now there's a massive  misconception as far as what exactly the  Illuminati is and what exactly the  Illuminati stands for but like I said  we're definitely gonna dive into the  actual history of the Illuminati because  you guess the Illuminati really did at  one point exist but first I want to kind  of talk about the common conspiracy  theories surrounding the Illuminati one  of the more commonly explored conspiracy  theories surrounding them is that those  within the Illuminati are actually Satan  worshippers it's said that they are  pushing this new world order for Lucifer  in order for him to dominate the human  race so basically this is all done under  and for the devil if that makes sense  now in a way this does go hand in hand  with some of the symbolism used to  identify the Illuminati but we'll get  there in a little bit either way many  celebrities and even past presidents are  said to be a part of the Illuminati and  it's even said that those who know too  much or threaten to expose the  Illuminati wind up assassinated and it's  made to look to be an accident some  people who fall under the category of  potential conspiracy where that's  concerned is but not limited to Michael  Jackson Marilyn Monroe John F Kennedy  Martin Luther King and the list goes on  and on but like I said that is  completely based upon conspiracy so what  exactly was the Illuminati I think a lot  of people will be shocked to know that  the Illuminati actually plays part in  history there was a good decade where  the Illuminati was was very much real  interestingly enough the Illuminati was  at one point a very real elite super  secret society the Illuminati was  actually originally  in 1776 by a man named Adam buy shop the  original creation of the Illuminati is  referred to as malaria or Bavarian  Illuminati because Adam was actually a  professor in Bavaria Germany during this  specific time Bavaria was both Catholic  but also extremely conservative Adam had  what he believed to be a very realist  approach to life and he felt as though  the monarchy and the church was  repressing freedom of thought initially  Adam actually thought of joining the  Freemasons but it was said that he  couldn't afford the admission fee and  upon diving into a world of books and  non-traditional ways of thinking Adam  decided to create his own secret society  instead now here's where a massive  misconception as far as the creation of  the Illuminati is concerned many people  actually believed that the Illuminati  was formed on the premise of Satanism  however Adam claimed that he was never  actually against religion rather against  the way that religion was practiced  enforced and required he felt like  religion was forced on people and  therefore was suppressing their freedom  of thought so it wasn't necessarily that  he was against religion but rather the  way that they went about religion his  society was set to provide freedom from  religious prejudices social virtues and  just overall prospect happiness  the very first Illuminati meeting took  place on May 1st 1776 in a forest with  six men including Adam the men basically  discussed the rules of this secret  society and they decided a with standing  and strong reputation was required in  order to join along with wealth  connections and at the end of all one of  their approval the Illuminati actually  continued to grow and grow and by 1782  it was said that they grew by like six  hundred members they had expanded to  extremely influential individuals such  as but like I always say not limited to  jurists politicians  men writers and more they were  accumulating a group of very powerful  individuals with a new way of thinking  by 1784 it was believed to the  Illuminati had up to 3,000 members  interestingly enough the Illuminati  actually utilized spy-like tactics in  order to remain anonymous they came up  with code names to keep their identities  secret and the process to getting in  would take several steps several jumps  and a lot of Secrets it was also said  that around this time the owl became  their symbol which we'll talk about  later super creepy stuff revolving  around that but it was also said that  they didn't trust anybody over the age  of 30 because they were too set in their  ways  however in 1785 the Duke of Bavaria  banned secret societies and placed  strong punishments for those who joined  and that's where the first real  conspiracy began because many people  believed that all this did was force the  Illuminati to meet more in secret to be  more secretive and to hide the fact that  they existed many people believe the  Illuminati never stopped and  interestingly enough it's claimed that  in documents found in high-ranking  Illuminati members homes there was  evidence of their world domination plan  so this is where the modern-day  conspiracy really comes into play and  ties in because many people believe that  the Illuminati  never stopped that their plan for world  domination never stopped and that the  New World Order is very much in the  works people also believe that many of  your favorite celebrities and  politicians and those high-ranking in  power are within this secret society one  of the biggest reasons that people  believe so many people are a part of the  Illuminati and that the Illuminati still  exists to this day is due to symbolism  so I thought we could kind of break down  the more commonly seen symbols  associated with the Illuminati kind of  talk about the history of them and dive  into pop culture where a lot of these  symbols are seen frequently so the very  first symbol that I really want to dive  - is the all-seeing eye this is perhaps  the most popular and notorious symbol  associated with the Illuminati it's even  found on something seen so common and  utilized so often as the dollar bill now  this symbol is actually said to  represent God watching over humanity  however many believe that's not the case  and that it's actually the symbol of the  Illuminati I do want to take note that  this symbol was adopted in 1782 as part  of these symbolism on the reverse side  of the Great Seal of the United States  remembering that the Illuminati was an  active secret society from the year 1776  to 1787 represents the Illuminati while  others on the contrary believe that it  represents the Freemasons however common  Masonic use of this symbol dates 14  years after the creation of the Great  Seal no I actually should take this  opportunity to note that many people mix  up the Illuminati and the Freemasons and  believe that they're one in the same  that is completely untrue the Illuminati  and the Freemasons are two separate  parties in themselves however it is said  that those high up in the Freemasons are  actually also top aluminous as well and  some have confirmed that the all-seeing  eye is more so a symbol of the  Illuminati many people believe that this  all-seeing eye is meant to represent  seeing of all things I mean of course  it's called the all-seeing eye  but people have want to step further to  decode it meaning that the Illuminati is  always watching which kind of leads me  into my next symbolism that's associated  with the Illuminati and that is that's  overtop of the eye which many believe to  be six six six which ties into the  Illuminati being Satanists set to take  over the world under Lucifer what makes  that all the more creepy when this is  placed over top of an eye is that if it  means the all-seeing eye is always  watching perhaps that means Lucifer 666  is always watching now there are so many  symbols surrounding the  Menotti besides just those two which are  the most common but the one that I  really want to dive into is that of the  owl because like I mentioned earlier it  was said that the Illuminati adapted the  owl as their symbol it is said that they  initially thought of the owl because the  owl thrives at night much like that with  their nightly meetings in the forest and  rituals but it's also so that the owl  represents enlightenment being  enlightened wisdom intelligence and  power which is all of what the  Illuminati believed they were or are no  it's said that a lot of people in modern  culture will associate owls as a way for  others in the society to recognize  they're in it as well it's kind of their  way of utilizing symbolism to address to  one of the other that they're within the  secret society as well  [Music]  the Apple is also said to be hidden on  the dollar bill I'll insert a picture  which is interesting but here's where it  gets a lot creepier and a lot darker  where the Apple is concerned and that is  to do with the conspiracy surrounding  Bohemian Grove now I'm not gonna get too  deep into this this is a conspiracy  within itself but Bohemian Grove is a  restricted campground area in California  where once a year the top of the top  most powerful men meet which is  including but not limited to famous  musicians prominent business leaders  government officials even former US  presidents and basically just men of the  highest power where the AL ties in is  the fact that they do these ceremonies  in front of a giant owl shrine there's  this giant concrete owl  many people believe that these men of  power are within the Illuminati and that  they meet annually to perform these  ceremonies in front of this mass owl  where they plan world events and some  people even say that they do rituals and  sacrifices but like I said this is all  conspiracy this is based off conspiracy  I am NOT stating that that is factual  most of all where the Illuminati is  concerned is within subliminal messages  there have been so many Illuminati  associated symbols and children's shows  in television and in music  [Music]  some of the most influential people are  throwing up these signs associated with  the Illuminati  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  and sharing certain messages that are  just really eerie as if they know  something that we don't know  I know baby I wanna tell you just so you  know basically if I dove into everything  and anything to do with the Illuminati  we would be here all day but this is  basically the premise and the foundation  of which the conspiracy of the  Illuminati lays upon like I said you  guys this is only a one part of a three  part series not necessarily just with  the Illuminati but with a conspiracy  that all ties in and the other two  videos are gonna be coming this week  where this will all just tie in and just  make your brain want to explode with all  of the information but like I said the  Illuminati is a very difficult thing to  research there's just enough but when  you start to get down a rabbit hole  that seems like you're heading somewhere  somehow you're always diver knit back  which makes me believe perhaps something  or someone doesn't want us digging too  deep and for the sake of the fact that I  really enjoy my youtube channel and I  really enjoy my life and I love my  family and I want to live I'm not gonna  keep digging for that reason alone well  that is until I'm done this three-part  series well you guys that is basically  everything to do with the foundation of  the Illuminati if there's any aspect of  this video you want me to dive deeper  into if you want a part two of the  Illuminati alone or you want to see just  conspiracies surrounding it drop your  comments down below and let me know I  cannot wait for you guys to see what I  am cooking up this week it is really  thought-provoking stuff conspiracy  theory based stuff and it's required a  lot of research so I hope that you guys  enjoy it that is it for today's video if  you guys are new to my channel or you  are just not yet subscribed make sure  you go ahead and click that subscribe  button  join the Reese's Pieces we would  absolutely love nothing more than to  have you and please give this video a  big thumbs up because it was risky to be  digging into this stuff but I think it's  interesting so I thought I'd bring it  here to the Internet remember my loves  do all things with kindness and until  next time I love you guys  [Music]  [Music] ",1
STuhKAfehK4,"hello guys and gals me muta har and zoom  is getting the big baked banhammer and I  haven't seen a banhammer delivered this  hard since people broke street date for  Halo 3 now ladies and gentlemen let me  just put into perspective over here now  I mean total video on Zoom about two  weeks ago where I covered a lot of their  crappy practices regarding end-to-end  security their crappy malware and the  fact that two men was busting into their  servers all the time being be a name  ladies and gentlemen there's a lot wrong  with zoom right now all right like a lot  going wrong now ever since I made that  video zoom proudly has created a bug  bounty and they've definitely said all  right get ready they've had some  missteps and they're gonna get better  now I'm totally okay with a company that  goes out of the way and says yeah well  get better as time goes on we talked  about valor --nt earlier and valor n't  actually came out and really implemented  a more intensive bug bounty program for  their game and they're committing to  user privacy which is something you want  to bring out will that make me install  their game necessarily probably not my  my firm stance stills still stay strong  but I'm glad when companies go out of  their way to make sure that user privacy  is held to a high regard because in  today's day and age ladies and gentlemen  Daddy muda gives a shit about your data  okay because data is like the new gold  all right there was the oil rush there  was the gold rush there was the there  was there was every time to rush the  kpop rush and now it's all about the  data rush everyone's vying for that  juicy juicy data and why should you give  it to them if you don't have to  that's my oh that's my point into it now  so far zoom is getting banned in in  Singapore for zoom bombing where a naked  adult male is using racial slurs I don't  I feel I don't know that youtuber in  particular India has decided to get rid  of zoom but luckily the zoom company is  working with India right now to make  sure that they don't have to abandon  zoom Google outright banned zoom because  you know what Google's realize that holy  shit we have a better product on our own  hands why it's art why are our employee  bases using something else they can't  even install zoom on their laptops  anymore hey guess what even the  Taiwanese government on this video just  got banned in China let's be real and  Canada got completely kicked out and  they just told zoom to go go-go-go-go  pools closed we can't use you in  government conversations now I don't  understand why this is necessarily super  newsworthy because none of this should  surprise you  guess what governments are not going to  trust an application that doesn't  provide proper end-to-end encryption for  actual government communications it's  because when a government communicates  they're usually communicating about  really really sensitive shit so when you  have to deal with the world were in  right now especially with this whole  quarantine in effect no one is willing  to talk about you know all their secret  of stuff using a platform that has so  many security vulnerabilities that is a  fact  now when it comes to a lot of these big  tech firms like Google and Microsoft and  Apple you have to understand these  companies have their own equivalences to  them  no company like Amazon Google Apple or  Microsoft or any of these former firms  are actually going to use software from  somebody else when they have plenty of  good in-house solutions believe it or  not a lot of these services rely on  Amazon Google or Microsoft or even  Facebook to provide them with the data  farm capacity to actually use these  applications so it shouldn't blow you  away that those applications can not be  used or those applications could not be  recreated by these firms that are  banning them quote unquote  now zoom is one of the biggest  applications right now regarding  teleconferencing and teleconferencing is  all the rage we're stuck at home boys  and girls we can't do anything except  use these applications to get our jobs  done to get our school done to get  whatever done now I wouldn't make this  video just to follow up without giving a  you can have your cake and eat it too  I'm gonna add that to all my videos  regarding technology is you can have  your cake and you can eat it too all  right now ladies and gentlemen zoom has  plenty of applications if you go to  their download center you'll notice they  have clients for Linux all right they  have extensions for browsers they have  mobile applications which won't really  apply to our situation here but then  they have controllers which is more for  somebody who's managing a party so they  have plenty of applications you can try  and use but for the most part it's  definitely done through a browser now  the reality of it is is normally I would  consider most of  the safe but usually browser  applications nowadays are probably just  as risky as regular applications if you  have that level of paranoia in you now I  would generally say it's safe for the  most part I think the encryption between  you and zoom is pretty well done it's  usually the encryption they have from  zoom climb to zoom client internally in  their server that's the real problem  now let's say that you're in a school  all right I get it  muda I'm in school my professor my  teacher is forcing me to use zoom okay  well ladies and gentlemen it's time to  show you how you can have your cake and  how you can you too now a lot of people  have called me paranoid Andy for using a  lot of these applications but VirtualBox  is one of those applications you  definitely want to use or VMware Player  or if you're daring like me you can use  QEMU KVM if you're on linux but usually  i'm gonna assume you're on Windows or  Macintosh in this case but ya know you  can use something like VirtualBox 6.1 in  this case as of today's video just  download that follow the instructions  and then you want to definitely make  sure you get a Microsoft Windows 10 for  your VirtualBox okay so all you have to  do is go to Windows 10 ISO download on  Google and usually it's this first  option that you're looking for it's  called Windows 10 disk image ISO file  and then you just select the fact that  you want Windows 10 hit confirm and then  all you have to do is make sure you pick  English or whatever language you're into  these days I mean he'll if you want  Arabic go for that I don't care it's all  up to you download the 64-bit client is  gonna be like a 5 gig file and now we'll  get an installing it so on the  VirtualBox screen I know you can't  really tell that easily because I have a  really really crappy like a plasma  interface for my Linux system but all  you have to do is click new right up  here and then you just call it zoom zoom  or whatever you want to call it at this  point I don't care it's all up to you  make sure you set a folder where you're  gonna store this make sure it's Windows  10 64 bit hit next and give it an amount  of memory usually I'd give it like 4  gigs but two gigs will work just fine I  would give it 4 gigs just give it 4  thousand it's like 4098 if you really  wanted to get all technical with it but  4,000 is fine  create a new hard drive space go next  dynamically allocated and all you have  to do is make sure one  you've created all this you want to hit  start and it should actually give you  this prompt where it says select startup  disk all you have to do is click on this  option and you can find your Windows 10  ISO which should be on my desktop real  quick if I can just find it for you yeah  right here Windows 10 1909 English 264  hit choose you want to go hit start and  finally as long as it's running you'll  notice  hey here's VirtualBox it's fired up a  Windows virtual machine now you want to  go through with installing it like you  normally would it's not really that  difficult just hit next install now call  it a day  and once you're inside Windows 10 you  can then you zoom like you normally  would on a real computer so simply pass  your webcam pass your microphone through  these bottom settings real quick it  should be something you can figure out  now usually in VirtualBox here if you go  to devices you got a webcam you can  actually select the webcam it'll detect  it for you so if you want to pass  whichever one you want like for instance  I have two webcams for whatever reason  I'm just gonna click one pass through a  webcam it'll actually light up just to  let you know that it's it's connected  and whatnot then all you have to do is  go to devices and you can go to audio  and just also pass through your audio  input and this should just use your  input anyway so whatever microphone you  have plugged in whether that's built  into your laptop or it's like a  secondary you know microphone like I  have over here for instance it'll just  pass that along and you can use that to  run your zoom climb call and once you're  done just kill the VM that's all you  have to do if you're really paranoid and  you need to use a zoom app then this is  probably the best compromise you can  make without worrying about your  security in any case now that's just a  Windows explanation of it and I would  probably keep it to that  even if you're on a Mac you can still  virtualized windows and call it a day  and it's pretty much the same thing in  fact I think because zoom doesn't need  to install on there it might actually be  a safer alternative but that being said  ladies and gentlemen quick little update  about having your cake and eating it too  alright you do not need to just subject  your host operating system to this you  know what I bring up virtual machines  it's not because of paranoia I like to  compartmentalize my applications if you  realize that you're installing shady  software  you don't trust the software entirely  virtual machines are a great option for  you to use that software and not have to  worry too much about it there is  elements of VM busting code that can be  out there like there's viruses that can  bust through a virtual machine but do  not think it's as common as you may  believe it for now those viruses are few  and far between and to be honest with  you a lot of these services like  VirtualBox or VMware or parallels will  actually have dedicated teams working to  snuffing this out as much as you can so  kind of rest assured that you're getting  a much more safer experience doing this  than not that being said ladies and  gentlemen zooms getting banned but if  you're forced to use it follow this  guide and you should have a pretty  pain-free experience through it all and  honestly I know people are gonna mention  it in the comment section below but if  your teachers think you know they're  gonna make you do a test and lock your  computer out you can also virtualize an  operating system do your test in there  and you know the rescue I know you're  gonna Google answers on another page  anyways but yeah that's also possible to  write I mean fuck I knew I knew somebody  was gonna put that in the comment  section I might as well just tell you  that to begin with like yes you can in  fact beat the system now whether that's  morally up to you is all you baby that  being said this is me Moo too hard if  you liked what you saw please like  comment and subscribe just like it if  you dislike it this is how do you zoom  the right way I am out  [Music]  [Music] ",1
hvPMv6p9UuA,"with the current situation happening around the world especially in the United States the question has to be asked what are the implications to our food supply chain should we be concerned could the supply chain be disrupted damaged or even worse could food shortages become a reality in the next few months it's easy for us to take for granted how accessible food is to us in our modern world however as you may have now realized from the current situation we're living in things are changing quickly people are panic buying now for the first time in many generations the general population is suddenly realizing that having the food they need on hand is no longer guaranteed in this video we'll discuss a five signs of food shortage may be imminent and what you can do now to prepare yourself to ensure your family's safety in this video we'll discuss the signs you should be looking for and we'll conclude with some practical tips to help increase your odds of handling a shortage number one an availability of fill workers during normal times 36% of all Americans eat at a fast-food restaurant on any given day but now with 75% the United States under some sort of shelter in place order restaurants have shut down or have had to dramatically alter how they conduct business it's safe to say that Americans have a heavy dependence on sources of food that can easily disappear during a shutdown or shelter-in-place order the people supplying restaurants and agricultural products for food shelves are Arda filled workers this critical first line in the food supply chain and plants tends and harvest the crops supplying the stores and food processing plants that manufacture the products for your store shelves as illnesses spread through this group will inevitably see recalls on products for e.coli viruses and bacterias often there are recalls on products because of food we consider safe has been exposed to harmful contagions recalls are not a big disruptor of the entire food supply but illnesses amongst this working group slows output and supplies to larger manufacturers as reliable as our farms and production are they are still accepting the massive disruptions even from the smallest of contagions if this occurs and news spreads many people will start the hoarding process and panic products from the shells all over again this further compounds the shortages and Lisa more painting buying and hoarding behaviors filled workers are the first to plant and harvest our foods if there are widespread illnesses amongst this group the supply chain can be seriously disrupted these individuals are often the unseen undocumented workers that perform a very critical role in our food supply chain their access to medicine or medical care if they get sick is very limited leaving them much more vulnerable being a marginalized group their ability of weather this storm is far less than the average citizen you should really consider what products you rely upon and make sure you have enough of these products on hand to last you several weeks as I'm making this video there are already limits to the purchase of beans rice flour and other staples trade Wars drought and natural catastrophes and border crossings will all contribute to the diminished food production with current projections forecasting 2022 very likely produce record heat waves the possibility for crop failures is on the rise recent events have dealt additional blows to a vulnerable farm economy sending crop and livestock prices tumbling and raising concerns about sudden labor shortages if you see an escalation in any combination of these factors especially when combined together it should signal to you that shortages of food and stores is likely imminent logistical snags from closed borders to reduce work forces can put strain on usual supply routes especially for fresh produce be aware of any significant disruptions to this first line of the food supply chain recognizing when the disruptions in production are about to occur amongst this group can mean the difference between you having what you need to survive and waiting in long lines at the grocery stores only to find empty shelves number two reduce distribution and trucking the second sign of an imminent shortage are the distribution methods and truckers much of the food we eat is grown in other countries or travels great distances from the farm or ranch to your table when borders close and cargo ships can get through major ports has occurred after the events of 9/11 it's a sign that grocery stores and food processors will experience a disruption in their production capabilities a time when much of the nation's workforce may be furloughed or sent to work from home truckers have been deemed essential to keep America rolling when consumer demand for products skyrocket this industry can boom but disruptions to this industry by illnesses or the lack of availability of fuel could signal a second wave of food shortages with regards to cargo and container shipping we often don't realize that shortage of pineapples or avocados and it doesn't impact our daily lives to work around these disruptions in the food lines however extended shortages of imports like oil wheat rice beans and other staples for production can dramatically reduce food manufacturing production and output if you see stories of container ships lined up outside the nation's ports this should signal to you that a food chain disruption will follow also keep in mind that while America may have the necessary medical equipment and medication available to help individuals that get sick recover many countries especially the poor nations that we trade with do not have these luxuries if those that transport our who from other nations become sick in the workforce and those nations are crippled it will be difficult to get food to our own country as we've become a global community we have become more reliant on other nations while we may recover here they may not as quickly or ever are you prepared to get by if you can't grab from your pantry that box of whatever trucker striking cargo ships not being allowed in the port planes or trains not running or all signs of food shortage is m-net we've already seen employees on strike at Amazon recently due to the concern about the lack of adequate health conditions and their exposure to the illness as more people become sick over the next few weeks you will very likely see the impact of those that are responsible to getting food to our tables number three runs on stores recent lessons have taught us that in a crisis situation those who are not prepared will stock up on items they think that you will need runs on toilet paper are a perfect example of this while stores were selling out of toilet paper recently they were also selling out of box mills beans rice flour bread eggs meat milk and other essential foods as social distancing has become a practice long lines and limits on product purchases have become a reality even worse having to wait in line with possibly asymptomatic shoppers can put you and your family at risk later on is waiting to get food at the same time exposing yourself to a potential lethal carrier worth the risk the average person loading up on a cart full of toilet paper may not be looking for bread yeast or even flour right away 20 pound bag of flour can make at least 20 or more loads of bread having that in your storage can be a lifesaver and when the stores are sold out of white flour a savvy baker can use whole wheat rye or some alternative flour just as easily to provide critical calcium and B vitamins to a family beyond just baking though runs on stores can create shortages and other staples and knowing grocers are in low supply of any product should still afford you enough time to prepare your own supplies for an extended period of food supply disruption or even the need for our self sustenance worth mentioning here are electronic orders and scheduled deliveries these sources may become depleted and are not entirely reliable in a larger shutdown or order to shelter in place however when runs on stores begin to occur a well-timed in early order of stakes or prepackaged frozen mills could mean you'll receive what you need before the rest of the world overloads and depletes these resources at this point deliveries can be stretched from next week to next month - if we ever can a good example of this in our most recent crisis was bottled water delivery services while stores were selling out of bottled water five-gallon delivery of water through prearranged services in my area were merely limited to the quantities of previous orders food delivery source can keep you from having to dip into your supplies for as long as possible now just to be clear I'm not suggesting takeout when I say food delivery service takeout and delivery orders from fast food restaurants or workers may be forced to work while being sick or may be asymptomatic as they prepare your food it's very risky by food delivery I mean those services that ship or door deliver prepackaged meals or raw materials like fresh vegetables frozen beef or fish while is never a guarantee and these delivery services may also be disrupted or end altogether food delivery sources can be a potential means of supplying yourself in the early days of a crisis when stores are beginning to run out of products number four lockdowns quarantines and martial law without moving to the far extreme of martial law as a result of any civil and arrests it's important to be prepared for periods when you're in lockdown in quarantine or under a shelter-in-place order any of those situations are indicators at your ability to obtain food from traditional sources like grocery stores or take out our know are going to be feasible if people cannot move freely deliveries may slow or stop all together even having groceries delivered in the current crisis resulted in people waiting up to two weeks or more for their order to be delivered when online distributors at products experienced a slowdown as a result of lockdowns quarantines or martial law deliveries will experience a slowdown or in the worst case a halt in Sweden during the recent social distancing deliveries are only occurring at night it's reasonable to assume that should things worsen in the current crisis deliveries may halt move to a stagger schedule or cease altogether periods when you have to remain in your home or very real possibilities knowing how to cook and prepare food is an essential skill you should develop 10 pounds of pinto beans will do you no good if you don't know how to prepare them having the dried spices and herbs you need to make your Mills less bland can provide you a major moral and psychological boost during a period what you can't get to the store you will find that having all the ingredients you need on hand can make your time in your home easier to bear key to this is having a few pre-printed recipes or a basic cookbook for the staples you have stored alongside your containers you can't guarantee that your internet connection will allow you to search for recipes so it's important to have these printed and ready in advance if you're cycling through your supplies and keeping the fresh you should already be eating your stored foods and will hopefully have a few recipes you can make often these precautions and the skill of cooking guarantees you'll have food you can enjoy in activities to keep you busy should you be forced to isolate yourself it's important to recognize that lockdowns quarantines and martial law can all dramatically impact your ability to get the basic food you need to feed yourself and your family point number five let's look at non-traditional ways of obtaining food if you follow my channel you know I'm not here to scare you the preparation that I talk about is for the exact things we're facing right now globally realize that even in a crisis there are some non-traditional methods to obtain food social networking bartering and exchange are all ways to maintain your food supply through the social crisis your neighbours may have an essential item you can complete your supply with in exchange for a product you have an abundance of if everyone is recommended to shelter in place and grocery stores are overwhelmed your citrus tree or home garden may become a key commodity for you stretch your supplies seeing on a hoard of 40 pounds of pinto beans does nobody any good at exchanging four cups of beans for four cups of flour 4 eggs or 4 potatoes ensures that everyone in your community continues to thrive in even the worst of times these bartering networks can spring up organically social media can allow you to set up porch pickups as friendly as these exchanges may be however you want to make sure to avoid offering too much or revealing too much about what you have in your stock only trade for the essentials you need and then only for a small quantity that you're offering up you would not want to post a picture of your 20 pound bag of flour and state that you're willing to trade 4 cups of it while people are currently calm during this time if it worsens or food shortages become worse this may change the term is OPSEC which is short for operational security the less people know about what you have the better if trusting strangers on social media makes you uncomfortable sometimes calls to your friends family or next-door neighbors can still help you secure the food you need to fill in any gaps in your inventory another non-traditional way to obtain food is get it locally make connections at farmer's markets for when you might need them later local farmers a poultry man the fishmonger usually have contact information for their clients all can be critical sources when store shells are barren because they tend to be smaller operations not feeding into the larger national supply chain and they have to continue to run their operations and care for their animals and crops here also bartering is a great means you may not need an entire case of citrus or avocados but after you have what you need someone else may be willing to trade for some quantity of what you have one of the most reliable sources of food is your home garden if you have it attempted patio tomato plants a vertical planner or even a bowl venture into the world of hydroponic farming you may want to research it a little more if you're completely new to gardening a great book to get you started is the all-new Square Foot Gardening which you can pick up on Amazon I'll post a link in the description section below and it helped me when I first started getting in the garden if you think you could in mind go down this route you should plan to keep a few types of seeds in your supplies the problem with this method is that you are at the mercy of the plants growing that takes time and energy before you have any substantial harvest that means you can't wait to start your home garden the day that the crisis occurs that being said last year's harvest the tomatoes at you painstakingly dried and stored or dehydrated freeze dried or pickle foods from your last harvest may be a lifesaver when a crisis occurs to summarize the points in this video if history teaches us one thing it's that when we are well informed and adequately prepared we increase the odds of our survival food shortages are a reality in any extended crisis or periods of social unrest if you make some key observations earlier you can't stay ahead of the shortages make certain that you have the food and supplies you need watch for disruptions in the field of worker population our farmers having a difficult time finding laborers watch for disruptions in distribution methods like shipping and trucking watch were the early signs of a run on products or store shows and focus on filling the gaps in your supplies with the other products you need that the general population isn't yet realizing they're gonna be short on when store runs are occurring realize you may also still have time to place an early order from a food delivery service ahead of any disruptions in this channel well lockdown quarantines and martial law our guarantee of coming food shortages and may leave many too late to stock up or even get the essential foods they need building connections with local producers bartering exchanging and home gardening can fill the gaps in your supplies and maintain a steady supply of some foods if you found this video informative and helpful please feel free to like it and share on social media with your friends family or community I've also posted additional links to videos I've done regarding gardening food preservation in description section below do you have any comments or anything you'd like to share

Thomas Cowan MD discusses the  corona virus I can't help but say  something about this whole corona virus  thing if you want me to look viruses are  simply excretions of a toxic cell Wow  this is very interesting  there has been a dramatic and quantum  leap in the last six months with the  electrification of the earth and I'm  sure a lot of you know what that is it's  called 5g ah and I'll finish with  anybody want to make one guess as to  where the first completely blanketed 5g  city in the world was exactly yeah  transpose Phi equal Corona fight won't  allow me to share on Facebook due to  false information reported sure you  ground barefoot everyday to the earth  and the natural electromagnetic field do  some research on grounding it is  absolutely critical to human health how  do you explain the counties that don't  have 5g yet but people are still getting  sick and dying from the corona virus oh  yeah that is a good question this  information is being censured now it's  being rightfully ridiculed this is  exactly why Henry the eighth banned  mobile phones during a time of plague  coronavirus it doesn't subscribe for  real that's so the best explanation or  you know maybe it's not a very good  explanation at all maybe just maybe you  should learn about how pass virus isn't  such a transmitted you know back when we  didn't have 5g anyways you're stupid  don't try to argue because you're wrong  lol why all of you nope stop the 5g  rollout I want to stop it but I don't  know how pretty somebody teaches how we  would be the foot soldier I know y'all  just get rid of your cellphone's and  never get another one get rid of your  internet too you can't be too sure 2017  this guy had his medical license  suspended in California for deported  guys are the ones spreading the sinful  probably all fake accounts by the  government calling him a quack whoever  uses that word a simple Google search  proves us right please get fucked then  I'll tell you if I G can infect this  many people with the fake flu or  whatever the fuck it was just imagine  how much faster on mobile speeds are  going to be look we had some weak-ass  pandemics back with 3G and 4G technology  like SARS and swine flu which never even  got close to my small rural farm town I  mean the reception just sucks out here  but listen this 5g signal strength must  be crazy good because right now my whole  town is sick with this level of national  coverage I'll never have to worry again  about dropping a call while I'm  screaming into the phone for an  ambulance while shaking my fist at the  nearest radioactive cell tower anyway I  feel like I'm in a multiplayer co-op  game right now with all these other  people shitting on how stupid this  fucking video is yeah sure I'll take  advice from dr.

up they turned off  commenting up okay well that's good so I  got some rage out of my system there and  I'm sorry I was on such a mean streak  earlier guys that's not fun to watch  it's not good etiquette I was just being  an asshole and you know it's probably  because we're in such miserable awful  stupid times right now that it's tough  to keep that kind of stuff internalized  everybody's ready to blow their their  top everybody's ready to go through the  roof everybody's mad everybody's  frustrated  nobody has patience for anything and  when we do blow up at each other because  we're all stuck at home it's gonna be  anonymous and online so that means  social media websites are gonna profit  because they're designed to provoke that  sort of engagement so it's just going to  be an endless cycle until we can all  leave our fucking houses is going to go  to a bar and that sucks I don't want to  talk to people like that that it makes  me feel weird afterwards and I don't  like feeling that way some of the things  I said we're just straight-up mean not  even funny like I told this lady that  god is dead that's not cool  like I shouldn't do that so what I need  to do now I think to make myself feel  better is going and apologize to these  people and let them know that I didn't  mean it it's just that they're too  stupid to know they're wrong and that  they actually need to be treated like  babies because babies have a better  understanding of the fucking one being  mean again alright sorry I'm just gonna  I'll just be nice I'll just say  something nice hey sorry for spamming  this group of the George Bush pics and  calling you all stupid I still think  you're stupid but I didn't mean to come  in here and slap all your dicks out of  each other's mouths like that god damn  it that's still so mean alright you guys  ever wonder if you'd be less crazy if  they never made the Matrix movies fuck  come on there's got to be something nice  I can say God come on hang on I didn't  even touch the keyboard just now how did  that get tight nope nope nope nope  I guess there's got nothing to say I  just have  nothing to say to these people so I'm  gonna leave that comment box empty I  know it's just gonna lead to me say mean  stuff to a bunch of people who act late  they got hit by trains as kids up and  somehow I just posted a picture of a  shirtless old man hmm interesting  so what have we learned today students  well we learned that people are starting  to abandon the idea of trying to explain  things to conspiracy theorists and are  now just instead calling them stupid and  telling them to shut up well this new  method work yeah who knows but we also  learned that when you're a jerk to  random people online sometimes you look  back and it makes you feel bad so what  to do do you talk shit or do you say  nothing what do you choose I know what I  choose and I just found it a third  option forged by my own hand that's  right  pictures of shirtless old men nobody  knows what you mean when you post one of  those are you with the group are you  against the group do you want to know  what's going on are you telling people  what's going on  shirtless old men is how you talk to  conspiracy theorists from now on that is  the way you will listen to me I am  holiday furred Cruz and I am  undefeatable  come get me FEMA and post yes

temper out on someone  what do we got down here though oh  that's a lot of shirtless old dude  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music] ",3
0WuwYdSdjlw,"so as they say light is the best  disinfectant in this case it might be  let's go through through this again the  research said UV light on non-porous  surfaces could kill the virus and yet  here the president is suggesting putting  light through the skin so supposing we  hit the body with a tremendous whether  it's ultraviolet or just very powerful  light and I think you said that hasn't  been checked but you're gonna test it  and then I said supposing you brought  the light inside the body you can which  you can do either through the skin or in  some other way and I think you said  you're gonna test that too  the president didn't stop there  watch as he tried to bring in dr. Burks  on this idea I would like you to speak  to the medical doctors to see if there's  any way that you can apply light and  heat to cure you know if you could and  maybe again maybe you can't again I say  maybe you can maybe you can't I'm not a  doctor I'm like a person that has a food  you know what have you ever heard of  that the heat and the light relative to  certain viruses yes but relative to this  virus that is a treatment I mean  certainly fever is a good thing when you  have a fever it helps your body responds  but not as I've not seen again here's a  woman who spent her entire life as Willy  said fighting disease fighting  infections going across the world doing  doing tireless work like doctor Falchi  on HIV saying I and in spending her  entire life in medicine and science  saving lives and she's having to answer  question of about whether Americans  should put disinfectants inside their  bodies and light inside their bodies to  kill a  virus that has become a pandemic that  again it bears repeating  in January the president honored State  said it's nothing to worry about it's  one person coming from China at the end  of February he said it's just 15 people  soon it will be down to zero nothing to  worry about  in March still telling leaders just to  relax stay calm and there's nothing  friends to worry about that's and of  course amplified every day Sean Hannity  same word Fox News as if they came from  Sean himself as opposed to the president  he's always read great points so you  wonder what the breaking point is in  terms of whether or not people inside  the White House see this president as  mentally and morally fit it's worth  asking the research also showed how  disinfectant could kill the virus on  surfaces watch dr. Burks his body  language as the president raised the  possibility of injecting cleanser inside  the body and then I see the disinfectant  it knocks it out in a minute one minute  and is there a way we can do something  like that by injection inside or almost  of cleaning because you see it gets in  the lungs and it does a tremendous  number long so it'd be interesting to  check that so that you're gonna have to  use medical doctors with but it sounds  it sounds interesting to me the press  then turned to the homeland security  official who presented the research to  make sure they didn't miss anything  about the use of disinfectant the  president mentioned the idea about  cleaners is complete release of propofol  imagine there's no scenario that could  be  jacket is there you know I'm here to  talk about fine that we haven't study we  don't do that within that lab our lab  okay and then the president's theory  about summer weather well again just  remind everybody the president had been  saying for months so this is going to  magically go away in April when it get  warmer it was going to magically go away  of course we we again we see that in the  month of April when he said it could  just magically go away because it gets  warmer again more people have died in  the month of April of this coronavirus  that Sean Hannity said was the media was  using as a hoax to attack the president  politically more people died in that  month of April when the president said  it could magically go away because of  the heat and died on 9/11 died in the  first Iraq war Americans Americans who  died in the second Iraq war Americans  who died in nineteen year war in  Afghanistan of course many more  Americans have died and died on  September 11th in fact you could compare  the combat deaths in the Korean the war  the entire Korean War more Americans  have died of this virus it's just a few  months ago Sean Hannity was calling a  hoax saying that the media's coverage of  it was a hoax he said that uh March the  9th more people have died in this month  of April when the president said it was  going to magically go away then died in  all of the Korean War and yes most  likely by the end of this week more  Americans will have died of this  pandemic which the president said was  going to magically go away when it get  warm in April could just magically go  away when it gets warm most likely by  the end of this next week then died in  the entire via so this concept the  summer weather killing the virus that  too got a real-time fact check a lot of  people have been talking about summer  maybe this is one of the reasons we've I  once mentioned that maybe it does go air  with heat and light and people didn't  like that statement very much the the  fake news didn't like it at all and I  just threw it out as a suggestion but it  seems like that's the case it would be  irresponsible for us to say that we feel  that the summer is just going to totally  kill the virus and then if it's a  free-for-all and that people ignore  those guys that is not the case so Mike  Barnicle you you we have John Heilemann  who's always said that so much of what  Donald Trump says is either projection  or confession itself so funny actually  that he's accusing others of fake news  the same time they're asking if he  should really tell Americans that they  should put disinfectant inside their  body and you know it bears repeating in  February On February 27th the president  said this pandemic that's killed 50,000  people was just one person coming in  from China he said he had it completely  under control he said there was nothing  to worry about that's January 22nd in  February throughout February he said  there is nothing to worry about even  near the end of February he was saying  that it was 14 15 people soon it would  be down to zero people he said he had  done a great job and there was nothing  to worry about  in March when Republican senators  started being concerned his quote just  stay calm  we have it under control everything's  going to be fine and he kept musing  about April how it would warm up and  this would go away he told a group of  African American leaders that it would  enlarge that it would just magically go  away and here we are again he said  several weeks ago we don't have to go  back over the president's past  statements let's talk about the future  let's let's try to encourage them to do  the right things in the future well here  we are near the end of April and Donald  Trump is talking about putting  disinfectants and lights inside of  bodies and he's been corrected time and  again this week  by his doctors who are saying yes it's  going to come back in the fall after the  president says it's not going to come  back in the fall he pushes he pushes  scam drug fixes that his doctors have to  correct him on and now they're having to  correct him on this latest madness  you really do wonder what's going  through the minds of Republican senators  and Republicans Republican members of  Congress and Republicans who serve with  this president yes we're in the middle  of what he called a war and we have a  president who is wandering off aimlessly  on this pandemic battlefield endangering  so many American lives well Joe in a  rational political world of which we are  not part we're no longer a part of that  there is no longer a rational political  world around us I'll tell you what might  be on their minds the 25th amendment  because yesterday the President of the  United States actually posed a threat to  public safety to the public safety of  the citizens of this country those were  the musings of a man who has spent a  whole lot of his lifetime in a tanning  bed so he's been exposed ultraviolet  ways in order to look like he has a tan  all the time  those were the irrational rants of a man  who somewhere out in this country god  forbid some went some adherent of his  someone who follows him closely and  adores him and there are many people  like that will take a lot a little sip  of Clorox bleach today to ward off the  potential of the virus and they will die  and then to your other point that you  raised earlier you have dr. Burke  standing there so I posed this question  to the country how would you feel if dr.  Burke's  in doctor foul Chi both resigned under  protest that the president is acting  like someone who is mad someone who has  gone temporarily insane who is deranged  who feels cornered who will say anything  to get out of anything at a particular  moment in time  long-term not leadership not looking  down the road but get out of something  like right now how would you feel if  they resigned well that would be  terrible news for the country of course  they've hung in this long let's hope  they continue to here's some reaction  from around the world headlines  newspapers dangerous bizarre insane  horror those are some of the headlines  from the papers in the UK on president  Trump suggesting yesterday that again  injections of disinfectants like bleach  and UV light into the body may treat  coronavirus he's just thrown out ideas  he says Australia's top doctor called  the president's suggestion quite toxic  and the New Zealand Herald framed  Trump's comments on disinfectant says  quote potentially fatal saying quote to  be 100% clear those are not things  anyone should be doing caddy K again  it's embarrassing that these things have  to be said out loud and I'll repeat what  we said at the top of the show that  Lysol which is owned by a British  company the British company had to put  out a statement refuting what the  president said life's all actually had  to put out a statement in which it said  under no circumstances should our  disinfectant products be administered  into the human body they weren't saying  that because there's some crazy tide POD  mean going around and teenagers are  eating it they're saying it because the  most powerful man in the world offered  it as a suggestion just throwing out  ideas bringing ideas to the table at the  podium in the briefing room at the White  House yesterday  yeah because we've already had a couple  die from taking hydroxychloroquine under  the wrong circumstances after the  president stood there up the podium and  so Lysol understandably is saying look  we really want to make sure that this is  does not come back to bite us and that  people are going to take the President  of the United States seriously I think  what Philip bumper said in the what from  The Washington Post in that briefing is  exactly the right question mr. president  why are you standing up there giving the  country rumors people are looking to you  in these briefings for advice and health  that really works for things that we  know are proven and that we can take  home with us there is an awful lot of  confusion and fear out there and when  you add this kind of rumor to it it just  adds to that we've already seen the  of America's leadership when it comes to  this coronavirus there is almost nothing  that the rest of the world is looking to  America for guidance on at the moment  the number of deaths the number of cases  the lack of testing the lack of  ventilators the lack of preparation a  system that just doesn't work to cope  with this a public health system that  doesn't work to cope with this the rouse  Between the States and the White House  over who has authority who doesn't have  authority it's been a shambles and the  country that has led the world for the  last 70 years is certainly not leading  the world at the moment but when the  president stands there and says this  kind of thing  he's also hurting himself politically  here I mean you look at that a people  from yesterday only half of Republicans  have trust in what the president is  saying when it comes to covert 22% of  Republicans say they have little or no  trust in what mr. Trump is saying about  the covert 19 infection so I'm not quite  sure how he thinks he's helping himself  when he rips like this throwing out  ideas that you know as we have you been  saying all morning I mean it's bonkers  right drinking or injecting disinfectant  anybody can tell you that I mean you  look at those numbers you look at the  poll numbers if that for those that are  listening on the radio right now it's  47% only 47% of Republicans have  confidence in what the president's  saying  mica even in his own party he doesn't  even have a majority of support for  people who believe what he's saying it's  just a plurality well every day these  these briefings I will say you know amid  the controversy as to whether or not  they should be shown in terms of their  value for having truthful information  that's a great debate but every day  these briefings reveal something new  about this president that people are  able to see for themselves because this  impacts their mortality he doesn't get  that and it happens every day and you  see these numbers let's bring it thanks  for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and  make sure you subscribe to stay up to  date on the day's biggest stories and  you can click on any of the videos  around us to watch more from Morning Joe  and in  n-b-c thanks so much for watching ",3
